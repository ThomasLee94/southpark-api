The Return of Chef
"Previously on South Park" Daytime. Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are playing with their toy trucks and cars under a tree in the neighborhood park. The basketball court, slide, and grass are cleared of snow. Stan runs up to them'
Stan
You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. [the others look up at him]
Kyle
Going away? For how long?
Stan
Forever.
Cut to the boys in the school kitchen, watching Chef pack up his apron
Chef
I'm sorry boys.
Cut to Chef in a bookstore
Stan
Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. [Chef opens a pamphlet about the club]
Chef
Wow!
Cut to Chef in Mrs. Garrison's classroom
Mrs. Garrison
Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!
Chef
What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
Mrs. Garrison
I hope you're making the right choice.
Cartman's house, day. Cartman crying in front of Butters, in the middle of the living room
Cartman
I'm gonna miss him. [Butters walks forward a few steps and puts his hand on the sofa] I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! [turns his head left and cries into his left arm]
Stan and Kyle sit on a log by Stark's Pond watching the sunset
Stan
Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. [Kyle draws close and hugs him]
Cut to a meeting room in City Hall. The room is decorated with balloons and a sign saying "Good Luck, Chef!!" hangs over the town mayor
Mayor McDaniels
And we will all miss you, Chef, [Chef watches from a nearby table] but we know you must do what your heart tells you..
Dusk. Chef boards a Super Adventure Club jet. The town is out to see him off at the airport.
Jimbo
Bye-bye!
Gerald
Good-bye!
Mr. Mackey
So long!
A Man
So long Chef!
A Sign-Holder
Good-bye, Chef!
Randy
Good-bye, Chef! Have a good time at the Super Adventure Club!
Chef
[waves] Good-bye! [goes into the plane and disappears from the door. The door closes and the plane taxis away. The town waves good-bye to Chef again and Cartman bawls uncontrollably in a high-pitched voice. The plane climbs into the sky]..
And now, Part Two of "Life Without Chef" The boys are playing Uno in Stan's house. Their insults to each other are flat now that Chef is gone.'
Kyle
Draw two card, fatass.
Cartman
[draws two and puts one down] Reverse to you, Jew. [the doorbell rings]
Stan
[irritable] I'll get it. [rises and walks over. He opens the door...]
Chef
Hello there, children!
Stan
He's back!
Kyle
Yeah!
Cartman
All right! [applause comes out of nowhere. Chef gives them a hug]
Kyle
Chef! I can't believe you're back!
Chef
Well, it's true.
Stan
But are you back for good?
Chef
That's right.
'The bar, daytime. Mrs. Garrison bursts through the door with the big news.'
Mrs. Garrison
Hey everybody! Chef's back!
Patrons
What? All right! Yeah! [they clear the bar to meet Chef]
Randy
Oh, finally! [prances away gleefully after the others]
'Jimbo's house, later. Jimbo serves up lemonade. Everyone is laughing at Chef's tales, but they quiet down'
Gerald
Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like interesting people.
Chef
Yeah!
Mrs. Garrison
But now that you're back here, does that mean you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore?
Chef
N-No! No.
Randy
Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
Chef
That's right.
Randy
Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply. [catches his breath] Right?
Chef
That's right, Randy! [everyone laughs approvingly]
Jimbo
Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.
Chef
Thank you, Jimbo.
Randy
Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
Chef
That's right! Thank you. Good-bye everybody.
Townsfolk
Later. Great to have you back. Bye-bye. See ya Chef. See you later. Bye-bye.
Kyle
Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
Chef
You bet! Good-bye, children! [the boys are puzzled at the way he's replying to them. It sounds choppy.]
Stan
Right. Uh, see ya.
'Outside Jimbo's house. The boys walk down the steps and move towards the sidewalk'
Cartman
Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
Stan
[stops. The others stop too. Stan looks up] Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
Kyle
Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
Stan
[turns left and cross the street. The others follow] Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
Kenny
(muffled) Yeah, me too.
'South Park Elementary, lunchtime. The floor is darker now.'
A Boy
[at one of the tables] It's really weird what he said, I don't know, it kind of confused me.
Cartman
Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
Kyle
Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! [a distraught Clyde walks by and stops.]
Clyde
Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
Kyle
Like what?
Clyde
I think...[glances at his food] I think he wants to have sex with me.
Stan
What??
Clyde
I gotta- I gotta go. [turns right and walks off]
Kyle
Weirdo. [Fosse moves up and gets his lunch; the boys follow him in]
Chef
Hello there, children!
The Boys
Hey Chef.
Chef
How's it goin'?
Kyle
Good.
Chef
Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?
Cartman
[The boys are stunned] Excuse me?
Chef
Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.
Kyle
...Chef?? A-are you ok?
Chef
I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.
Stan
Dude, what are you saying??
Chef
I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.
Stan
...WHAT??
'Mr. Mackey's office, later. A detective is walking into the class'
Det. Jarvis
Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef.
Kyle
This doesn't make any sense!
Det. Jarvis
We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile.
Stan
No he's not.
Det. Jarvis
[childish voice] Uh huh.
Stan
No he's not.
Det. Jarvis
[childish voice] Yeah, yeah he is so.
Butters
What's a pedophile?
Stan
Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef, [whips out generic plush doll with no features on it] so I'm gonna use this doll to ask you kids a few questions. Did Chef ever touch any of you... here? [points to the genital area]
Stan
NO!
Det. Jarvis
Ok, did he touch you here? [moves two fingers over the groin]
The Class
NO!
Det. Jarvis
[sits the doll on his right lap and starts rubbing the doll's nipples] Did he ever do this? How about this? [lifts the doll to his face and wags his tongue over the doll's genital area]
Butters
My Uncle Bud did that to me once! [smiles unwittingly]
Det. Jarvis
[gets off the desk and walks around] Did Chef ever try one of these on for size? [places the doll face down on the desk and starts humping it]
Kyle
Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
Det. Jarvis
[continues humping] Young man, will you PLEASE pay attention! This is very important stuff! Ohhh. Ohhhhhh.
'South Park Elementary, after school. The kids pour out of the school. The boys come out last, and the doors close. Chef appears before them'
Chef
Hello there, children!
Kyle
[the boys look at each other] Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
Chef
Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.
Stan
No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
Chef
Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass?
Kyle
Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
Chef
I specialize in your asshole, Kyle. [turns and walks away]
Cartman
...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
Kyle
He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
Kenny
(muffled) Like what?
Kyle
Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
Stan
Well look, he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
Kenny
(muffled) Yeah! I think...
Cartman
Yeah!
Kyle
All right, come on guys!
'The Super Adventure Club, day. The club is a rambling house several stories tall, and access to it is just one ragged rope bridge. The entrance to the bridge reads "Super Adventure Club." The boys approach it calmly and walk upon the bridge.'
Cartman
Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. [they step off on the other side and approach the front door. Stan reaches over and pulls the rope that rings the house's bell. A black butler opens up]
Butler
May I help you?
Kyle
Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
Butler
Right this way. [the boys enter and the butler leads them]
Head Adventurer
Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a-
Butler
Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you.
Head Adventurer
Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!
Club Members
Tally ho!
Mr. Connolly
Indeed!
Kyle
Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. [the members just look around]
Mr. Connolly
What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!
Marksman
We travel around the world and have sex with children!
Marine
Yes, what else would we do?
Kyle
Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
Mr. Connolly
Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club! [turns and approaches a world map from maybe two centuries ago] Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit.
Kyle
...Dude!
Mr. Connolly
I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club!
Stan
NO!!
Mr. Connolly
No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again? [whips out a portable hypnotizer and makes some whistling sound effects] How would you like to join the Super Adventure Club? [more sound effects]
Stan
[unnaffected] No! [Mr. Connolly tries harder, even stepping forward...]
Kyle
Dude, what are you doing?
Mr. Connolly
[looks at his machine] Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody. [hides it behind his back] Well, so long then.
Kyle
Just what the hell is that thing?!
Mr. Connolly
What? What thing? I don't see anything.
Kyle
HA! I knew it!
Stan
Knew what?
Kyle
The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this - fruity little club!
Cartman
Oh, son of a bitch!
'Robert J. Neeland, psychiatry. Chef and the boys are in the waiting room with a woman reading a magazine.'
Chef
Come on, Children. Let's all go home and make love.
Stan
You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
Chef
I just like to make love up your butt.
Woman
[turns away] Oh my God!
Nurse
[comes out to get the next patient]Mr. Chef, is it?
Kyle
All right, come on. [they follow the nurse in]
Dr.Neeland
Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?
Kyle
Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
Dr. Neeland
[approaches Chef] Brainwashed?
Stan
Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
Dr. Neeland
I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.
Stan
No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
Dr. Neeland
Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah.
Chef
Doctor, do you have- children?
Dr. Neeland
Why, yes, I have two young boys.
Chef
Have you all been sodomizing your children too?
Dr. Neeland
You say he's never been like this before?
Cartman
No, Chef has always been super-cool.
Chef
I'm gonna make love to the children.
Dr. Neeland
He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.
Cartman
So what can we do??
Dr. Neeland
I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process.
Kyle
But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
Dr. Neeland
Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?
Stan
Having sex with women.
Dr. Neeland
Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away.
'The Peppermint Hippo. The place is busy with pole dancers doing what they do best and so on.'
DJ
All right guys. be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique!
Chef
[a long-haired blonde tries to excite him] Aw, come on, children. Let's go home.
Stan
This isn't working.
Dr. Neeland
WEll let's...give it some time, kids. [a brunette is keeping him busy]]
Stripper
[coarse voice] Would you like to daaance???
Kyle
No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
Stripper
[walks away] Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance???
Cartman
Come on, bitch! Dance!
Blonde
Up yours, fatty.
Cartman
Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
DJ
All right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... Spantaneous Bootay! [an immense black stripper walks out, down the runway, and to the stripper pole, stout enough to hold her up. Chef leans his head to the right to get a better look.]
Stan
Come on guys, we might as well go. [the boys prepare to leave. The obese stripper can move, though, and Chef is interested. He drops the blonde off and approaches the stage]
Chef
God-damn!
Stan
Chef, we're leaving.
Dr. Neeland
No-no wait. Let him go. [Chef moves closer and stands in awe of Spantaneous Bootay]
Spantaneous Bootay
[walks up to Chef] Come here, chubby. [buries his face between her breasts and rattles it with them, then turns around and buries his face between her ass cheeks and rattles it with them as well. She releases him from their hold]
Chef
Wait a minute.
Stan
He's remembering.
Chef
Children! What have I done?
Cartman
It's ok Chef, Go on, remember!
Chef
I'm goinna- I'm gonna-
Kyle
Come on, Chef! You can do it!
Chef
I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!
The Boys
Yay!
Kenny
(muffled) Chef!
Chef
Hey children, everybody! I'm back! [a tranquilizer dart flies in on his left side and strikes him under the ear, behind the jaw, and his smile vanishes] Ow.
Mr. Connolly
[The Club is there] Great shot, William! Hit him with another. [William, dressed in outback gear, blows another dart out through a tube. This one lands in Chef's left arm]
Chef
Oh! [gets groggy quickly and drops like a sack of potatoes]
The Boys
Chef!
'Super Adventure Club, a stormy night'
Mr. Connolly
Stan
Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
Mr. Connolly
He's safe. [presses a remote control. The main screen comes on and Chef is shown strapped down to a bed while William sits in a chair at its foot] He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done.
Cartman
Look, If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
Mr. Connolly
We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!
Stan
Oh Jesus, here we go.
Mr. Connolly
Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.
Stan
We don't wanna hear it.
Mr. Connolly
You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas! [a gregarious man with an open smile in the picture] Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers, [a shot of him climbing up a mountain] but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it. [A shot of Phinehas reaching a summit, only to find two Brits there, celebrating] Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas! [Phinehas with some Australian natives] Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal. [a shot of him with those kids] But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal.
Stan
Immortal?
Mr. Connolly
He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies. [a graphic of kid bodies appears, and bright dots dapple them and move around] And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos. [a blue monster alien with a bright red crown. Next shot, Phinehas in the gondola of a hot-air balloon with several boys] Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892. [a shot of Phinehas' body on the train's bumper]
Kyle
...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
Mr. Connolly
Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?
Stan
Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.
Mr. Connolly
Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave. [dramatic fanfare]
Stan
We're not leaving without Chef.
Mr. Connolly
If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave. [dramatic fanfare] You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see! [laughs more and more sinisterly. Moments later...] Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating?
Kyle
We're not going anywhere without Chef.
Mr. Connolly
Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome. [the boys do not move] You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security! [two officers come out and stand behind the boys] Take these boys to the door.
Guard 1
All right, come on kids.
Kyle
No! Hey!
Mr. Connolly
[the lights come on] Haha! Look they're being led by security! Haha!
Stan
[to one of the guards] No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
Guard 2
This is their house and they don't want you here. [about to push Stan out the door. Kyle grabs a bat from a nearby jar and whacks the second guard in the back and the first guard on the legs. They both fall. The boys run towards the Deprivation Room]
Kyle
Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
''The Deprivation Room. William reads to Chef
William
And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills. [the boys break the door down]
Kyle
Chef, come on!
Chef
Childern!
William
Get out of here!
Cartman
Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
Kenny
[launches himself into a spinning projectile] (muffled) Yeeeeehah! [smashes William's groin. William doubles over in pain]
Stan
[rushes up to Chef] Come on, Chef!
Chef
[struggling] I can't...break these locks. [those are solid locks indeed]
Kyle
Here! [walks up to the fallen William, gets a small ax from him, walks up to Chef and chops the locks open. They escape the Deprivation Room]
'The club's living room. The boys run through it on the way out.'
Cartman
Run Chef!
Mr. Connolly
[turns to see what's happening] What the-? Impossible! I made them leave!
Kyle
Get outside! [chef and the boys reach the front doors]
Mr. Connolly
Stop them! [he leads the adventurers in the charge]
'Outside the club. Chef and the boys run out, heading for the bridge'
Chef
Children! Run! [they run to the other end of the bridge]
Mr. Connolly
Stop! [his group runs out of the club. Stan and the others reach the other side]
Stan
We made it!
Mr. Connolly
[calling out] Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place?? [Chef stops in his tracks]
Stan
Chef, come on!
Mr. Connolly
You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!
Kyle
Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef? [Chef's hesitance shoes a dilemma] Chef?
Mr. Connolly
Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL!
Stan
[softly] Chef, we love you.
Chef
[his eyes shift back and forth with his thoughts] I'm sorry children. [turns and walks towards the club]
Kyle
No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
Chef
Get the hell out of here, children!
Mr. Connolly
Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all. [a fierce flash of lightning tears the bridge in two, right behind Chef. Fire leaps on him and he screams] NO! [The club end of the bridge smashes into the cliff]
The Boys
Chef! [Chef tries to scramble up the bridge, but the fire is too fast and consumes it. He can't climb. The club members approach the edge of the cliff. One of them inadvertently kicks a stone off and it hits Chef, knocking him off the bridge and to his doom below.]
Chef
Ack. [He bounces off five jagged rocks before finally...] Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Damnit! [...landing on the jagged stub of wood piercing through some rocks, which impales him] Ah- Awww! [blood spreads out under him]
Stan
NO! [Chef struggles to get up, but can't move. A mountain lion leaps down into view]
Cartman
A mountain lion! [the lion grabs at Chef's right arm, but is having trouble ripping it off]
Mr. Connolly
We can't lose another member! Shoot it! [the marksman aims and fires]
Chef
Ah!
Marksman
All right, this! [fires twice, but the lion remains unaffected and continues pulling at Chef's arm]
Kyle
[heartbroken] CHEF! [a huge bear appears]
Cartman
A grizzly bear!
'the bear stands on its hind legs and roars at the lion, who lets go of Chef and runs up to the challenge. The lion leaps on the bear, trying to go for the jugular, but the bear grabs it and throws it off. The lion hits a cliff wall and falls onto the ground, dazed, but quickly gets up and sinks its fangs into Chef's head. Chef's face and left eye are ripped off and Chef is left babbling. The lion bites into Chef's right arm again while the bear has a hold of Chef's right foot, and at the same time, bear and lion each take a limb. Chef's legs and hips rip away from his torso, and Chef is effectively dead. The bear and lion walk off in different directions with their meals. The boys stare at Chef's remains in horror]
Stan
Oh my God...They killed Chef!
Kyle
You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!!
Mr. Connolly
Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester. [the men turn and go back to the clubhouse]
Cartman
Maybe- maybe he's still okay. [the other boys look at him, dumbfounded] No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
Chef
POOOT! [a mean final fart, and a soiled log falls out]
Cartman
Oh never mind.
Stan
Come on, let's go.
'South Park, a nice, sunny day. Spring is in the air. and a funeral for Chef is set in the town square. A long line of people are paying their respects. Mrs. Garrison steps up to the coffin, and Principal Victoria stands next to her for support. Down in the coffin is a spatula with a red ribbon around it. Kyle steps up to the podium, on which sits a picture of Chef and on the front of which hangs a wreath with the banner "R.I.P. CHEF."'
Kyle
We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days. [Elton John is present] Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us. [Stan, Cartman and Kenny look down at their feet] But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile. [they perk up a bit] I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song. [Timmy and Jimmy are sitting together] I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by. [Terrance and Phillip are present, weeping quietly] So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
Randy
Yeah.
Mr. Mackey
He's right. [soft applause rises from the crowd]
Kyle
And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. [smiles]
'The SAC house, operating room. The club members have gone down to retrieve Chef and put him on the table. Mr. Connolly and two of his men quickly get to work'
Mr. Connolly
Is it working? Is it working?
Tech
Yes. We've got a pulse!
Mr. Connolly
Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry! [an ICU suit is fitted onto Chef] We have done it! Good! Raise him up! [Chef and the operating table are tilted upright - but this Chef looks like Darth Vader. He has a glowing red spatula in his right hand] Chef, can you hear me? Say something.
Darth Chef
Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury Steak?
Mr. Connolly
Yes, go on.
Darth Chef
And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?
Mr. Connolly
Oh? You mean like chocolate candy?
Darth Chef
No, I mean my balls.
Mr. Connolly
Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa!
End of The Return of Chef

Smug Alert!
Downtown South Park, day. A hybrid car zips along Main Street. Gerald is driving it, with Kyle and Ike in the back seat and Ike safely tocked into his car seat behind Gerald. He stops in front of the Tweek house. The car has "hybrid" plastered all over it
Gerald
Hey there, Richard!
Richard
[stops shoveling snow and stands up] Oh, hey Gerald. New car?
Gerald
Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and- [closes his eyes as if to banish bad thoughts] be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
Richard
Well... Good for you.
Gerald
Oho... [gives a thumbs up, closes his eyes and says with a slight falsetto] Thanks. [drives off and back into town, where Mr. Stotch and Mrs. Garrison observe him drive by]
Stephen
Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski.
Mrs. Garrison
Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else.
An intersection. Gerald ends up abreast of an SUV and gets the driver's attention.
Gerald
You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment. [begins to drive away, with his eyes closed] Thanks.
Kyle
Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! [a quite-satisfied Gerald stops at the next intersection. Another hybrid car pulls up alongside him]
Driver
Hey, is that a hybrid?
Gerald
Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.
Driver
Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway, [sticks his thumb up through the passenger window] good for you!
Gerald
[sticks up his thumb in return and begins to drive away with his eyes closed] Thanks.
Kyle
[firmly] Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. [Ike's eyes are half-closed and he's getting woozy]
Gerald
Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
Kyle
What?!
True-Value Hardware and Home Improvement. Gerald begins posting citations on cars. He and his boys are wearing orange safety vests. Kyle and Ike are none too pleased about having to do this
Gerald
Okay, there's another one. [smiles and looks up after posting a citation on a green car] Aw, man! Look at that! [walks two cars over] Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick! [begins writing up a citation] "Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"
Kyle
[catches up] Dad, can we go home, please?
Gerald
Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
Kyle
But Dad, I want-
Gerald
NOW, KYLE! [Kyle's eyelids drop and he goes to write the citation. He and Stan cross paths]
Stan
Oh hey Kyle.
Kyle
Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
Stan
Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
Kyle
[his head drops] Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. [Randy reaches his red SUV and notices the citation on his windshield]
Randy
What's this? [takes the citation and reads it]
Gerald
Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
Randy
A ticket? "Failure to care about the environment" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!
Gerald
Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-
Randy
You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!
Gerald
Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
Randy
I know it's not a real ticket!!
Jimbo
[approaches] Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! [Randy crosses his arms]
Gerald
Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.
Jimbo
[crumples the ticket into a wad and throws it down] Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!
Kyle
Dad, let's just go!
Gerald
Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.
Randy
The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!
Gerald
Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was "high and mighty" to [closes his eyes] care about the earth!
Randy
And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
Gerald
Well, I really don't see how [closes his eyes] that has anything to do with the-
Randy
There, like that! Stop that!
Darryl
Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck!
Gerald
All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! [they walk away, and Ike bounces along]
The Broflovski kitchen, night. Gerald and Sheila chat as Sheila washes dishes
Gerald
Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
Kyle
[walks into the kitchen with Ike] Dad. [his parents turn to face him] Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
Gerald
[closes his eyes] Yes, it certainly is.
Kyle
We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... [rolls his eyes]
Ike
Take offense.
Kyle
...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... [rolls his eyes again and cues Ike]
Ike
[slowly] Alienated.
Kyle
...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
Gerald
Well, I totally agree, Kyle.
Kyle
You do??
Gerald
Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
Kyle
Righ! [grins] Okay, good.
Gerald
And that's why, [hugs Sheila by the shoulder] I've talked it over with your mother, and [releases the hug] ...we've decided to MOVE!
Kyle
What??
Gerald
We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! [grins. Kyle and Ike look stunned]
Stan's room, day. Stan has a book open, but his thoughts are elsewhere. Someone knocks on his door
Stan
Yeah? [the door opens and Butters enters]
Butters
Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
Stan
Going away party? What do you mean?
Butters
Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.
Stan
[jumps off his chair and looks at Butters] Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
Butters
Well he is.
Stan
Where's the going-away party?
Butters
At Cartman's house.
Cartman's house. There is indeed a party there, but Kyle isn't visible among the guests. The other fourth-graders are enjoying themselves. A banner above the sofa reads: GOODBYE KYLE
Cartman
[walks into the living room with a pitcher and cups of pop] Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! [blows into a noisemaker and makes it stick out. Other kids walk up and take cups away]
Token
Hey Eric, where's Kyle?
Cartman
Who? [smiles innocently]
Clyde
Kyle, the person leaving.
Cartman
Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
Craig
Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!
Stan
[enters the house and the other boys move a bit] Kyle? Kyle!
Clyde
Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.
Stan
What?!
Cartman
You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! [Stan leaves]'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!
Kyle's house, front lawn, day. His family is almost finished packing everything into the moving van
Stan
Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
Kyle
My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
Stan
Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.
Gerald
I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.
Stan
Well... Maybe they'll change.
Gerald
[puts a small box into the trunk] I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! [Kyle and Ike head towards it]
Stan
Nooo!
Gerald
[opens the back right door, and the boys climb in] Maybe you can make a difference, Stan. [closes the door] Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day, [walks around to the driver's side] we're just gonna have to be [closes his eyes] with our own kind. [gets in and begins to drive away. Stan steps into the street and watches them go]
Stan
I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
San Francisco, day. The city is seen from the north, with the Golden Gate Bridge in the foreground. All around is a brown haze that hangs over the city, but people don't seem to notice it. Another shot has a streetcar go by as San Franciscans go about their day. The third shot is Chinatown, the fourth is the Haight-Ashbury district with hippies everywhere. The last shot is of a row of houses stepping up a hill. The moving van stops in front of one of them. The Broflovskis move into their new home
Gerald
Well? What do you think, huh? [the boxes are present, but as yet unpacked]
Sheila
Oh Gerald, it's beautiful.
Gerald
Yeah. Now THIS, is a house. [some neighbors stop in]
Man
Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.
Gerald
Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.
Man
Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis [sucking on something purple] So how do you like the neighborhood?
Sheila
Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
Peter
Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to [closes his eyes] keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down.
Man 2
[approaches the front entrance] You in here, Peter?
Peter
Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis
Paul
Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan
Gerald and Sheila
Hello.
Paul
We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right?
Gerald
Yeah. That's right.
Peter
Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series [closes his eyes] Its emissions are actually cleaner.
Gerald
Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?
Peter
Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco. [farts, then bends over to take it all in, then stands up again] Ahhhm. [licks his lips to savor every last bit of fart] Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here.
Paul
Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest. [farts, then bends over to take it all in as if it were oxygen] Ahhh, [sniff] ahh, [sniff] ahh. [stands up] We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisco
Gerald
Yeah. We sure are.
South Park, Stan's house, night. Stan is on his bed working out a new song on his guitar. His door is open
Stan
Come on, people. Come on, people now. [Cartman and Butters enter]
Cartman
Dude, what are you doing?
Stan
I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
Cartman
THAT's gay, heh.
Stan
Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
Cartman
Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
Stan
You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
Cartman
[fears that for a moment, then] Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! [walks out]
Butters
Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. [walks out after Cartman. Stan resumes composing]
Stan
Come on, people. Come on, people now.
KXUV Radio Station. An extreme closeup of the host's booth.
DJ
All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with "Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already". [Stan's intro begins to play]
Stan

Come on now, people now people now
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.

as he sings, the following takes place: FM 1 98.7 shows up, Randy notices his son singing, Jimbo notices his nephew singing, a stranger slumps a little in his car, Principal Victoria notices one of her students singing, other people stop to listen
Customer
He's right. [people leave their cars and go to a Toyonda hybrid dealership]
Stan

We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now

as he sings, the following takes place: Randy joins the rush of customers checking out hybrids at the dealership, Jimbo drives off in his new red hybrid and pulls up next to the Stotches, who are driving their new hybrid as well. They give each other thumbs up and gloat a bit. Another driver pulls up alongside Randy and gives him a thumbs up. Randy returns the gesture. More people check out the dealership. Mrs.Tucker(Craig's mother) pulls up alongside Jimbo
Laura Tucker
Hey Jimbo, you got a hybrid too?
Jimbo
Yeah, I just wanted to [closes his eyes] try to set an example, you know?
Laura Tucker
Yeah, I guess it's up to us to [closes her eyes] show everyone the way.[opens them] Good for you
Jimbo
[cheerfully closes his eyes] Thanks. [drives off]
At an intersection
Mrs. Garrison
Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids? [pets her own hybrid]
Randy
I know! It's like "Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"
Mr. Mackey is parked amid a small crowd
Mr. Mackey
Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?
Two drivers going the same direction
Driver 1
[eyes closed, thumb up] Good for you!
Driver 2
[eyes closed, thumb up] Thanks!
Randy
[eyes closed, thumb up] At least we're smart enough to know better!
Driver 3
[leans out and looks back, eyes closed, thumb up] Thanks! [the street is now filled with hybrids]
Stan
Come on, everybody be people now
South Park Town Square, day. The stage is set up for a speech. On the curtains is a banner with a flag over it. The banner reads: WAKE UP AMERICA!
Speaker
And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country! [the crowd cheers]
Richard
If only the rest of the country [closes his eyes] was as insightful as we are.
Stan
[steps up and holds his trophy] Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. [steps down and walks off the stage. The crowd cheers]
Jimbo
Great speech!
Gerald
Yeah, well, you know my son is just [closes his eyes] a little bit more clever than some.
An officer
[stops Stan as Stan steps onto solid ground] Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song.
Stan
Yeah.
Ranger McFriendly
Uhh! [smacks Stan on the left cheek enough to spin his head around]
Stan
Ow!
Ranger McFriendly
You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!
Stan
What?!
Ranger McFriendly
Come with me! [walks off. Stan follows]
Ranger McFriendly and Stan walk to the top of a hill overlooking the town
Ranger McFriendly
There! Look! [a dark brown cloud is showing hovering over the town]
Stan
Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
Ranger McFriendly
Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!
Stan
Smug?
Ranger McFriendly
Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!
South Park breaking news. Awesome graphics
Announcer
This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!
Anchor Tom
It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?
Keenan
[at the weather desk] Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning. [a map of Denver and surrounding areas] All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country.
San Francisco, day. The scenes shown previously are repeated
Singer
A smuggy day in San Francisco town.
The Broflovski house, housewarming party
Paul
Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian?
Sheila
No! Hello, how are you?
Gail
Really good, really good. [she farts and quickly bends over to inhale it all]
Gerald
Hey there. Alan, right?
Alan
Actually, it's Alain
Gerald
Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?
Alan
Can I just get an empty glass?
Gerald
Oh. Sure. [hands him an empty glass]
Alan
Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death. [puts the glass to his ass and farts into it, then lifts the glass to his nose and inhales deeply]
Kyle's room. Brian and Mindy are present with two other kids. All of them are on Ike's side of the room, two of them on Ike's bed, while Kyle and Ike are on Kyle's side, sitting on Kyle's bed.
Kyle
[hesitant at first] So... what do you do for fun?
Brian
We drink and take drugs.
Boy 1
Do you want some acid?
Kyle
Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
Boy 2
You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.
Brian
It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.
Gerald
Everything okay in here, Kyle?
Kyle
Yeah, fine, Dad.
Gerald
So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys? [farts, then bends over and inhales his own fart] Wuhh [sniffs, rises and walks away] Mmmm.
Kyle
Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
Ike
I want three.
Stan's house, day. Butters and Cartman are playing a video game from Stan's sofa while Stan is on the phone
Stan
No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
Cartman
Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
Butters
[giggles] Yeah. You're right. [Cartman stops for a few seconds, then drops his controller]
Cartman
You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
Butters
Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
Cartman
No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
Ranger McFriendly
[barging in] Marsh!
Stan
Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.
Cartman
Who?
Ranger McFriendly
You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!
South Park News station, later. Stan looks over Keenan's shoulder as McFriendly, Cartman and Butters look on
Keenan
I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here. [a satellite map is shown, with a closeup window over it. There's smug everywhere] This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.
Cartman
[clearly doesn't know what's happening] The smug?
Keenan
The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here. [points to the smug over the California-Nevada border, near Reno] These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other. [moves his hand over the hurricane-like formation over the Nevada-Utah border] Now take a look at this. [moves his hand towards Southern California. A small cell is moving northward]
Stan
What is that?
Keenan
It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.
Stan
George Clooney's acceptance speech?
Keenan
Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.
Ranger McFriendly
We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!
Stan
What about San Francisco?
Keenan
[with gravity] Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco.
South Park Square, day. A town meeting has again been called, this time for storm preparation. Ranger McFriendly is talking
Ranger McFriendly
Soo, that's it people. [a different map showing the various smugs is shown, with an arrow going from Clooney's smug to the center of the super cell] When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen.
Randy
Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
Ranger McFriendly
If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes. [the crowd grasps, then people begin talking about it]
Jimbo
This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
Randy
Yeah. Good going, stupid!
Ranger McFriendly
Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town.
Stephen
Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! [the crowd responds vigorously to the plan]
Jimbo
Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! [Stan turns left and walks away]
Randy
Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!
Stan
[stops and turns to face the crowd] I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
Randy
Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
Ranger McFriendly
How long do we have until the smug clouds collide?
Keenan
Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.
The Arizona desert, day. The smug is shown floating over a desert road. Dusty and Sons gas station is shown. The smug is quickly approaching the station.
Attendant
The hell is that? [The cloud goes over the station. As it goes over, clips of George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech issue from within, ending with "Oscar winner, George Clooney, sexiest man alive"]
San Francisco, day. Cartman and Butters are at the city limit, having planned to rescue Kyle. Cartman puts on a pressurized suit with a long umbilical cord
Butters
Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
Cartman
[puts on the gloves] I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
Butters
But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
Cartman
You don't know San Francisco, Butters. [zips the suit up] It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old. [turns around and sighs] I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me. [reaches down, picks up the helmet, and puts it on, locks it in place, and pressurizes the suit. Communication resumes through the intercom] All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
Butters
[adjusts his headset] I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
Cartman
I'm not doin' it for Kyle. [turns around] I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. [begins to walk slowly and deliberately into the city]
Dawson's Junkyard, day. Hybrid cars are awaiting destruction. The camera focuses on a green one, which is soon lifted away by a massive electromagnet. Inside a small room, Stan mans the controls. Mr. Mackey and Stan's parents look on as Ranger McFriendly guides Stan
Ranger McFriendly
All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!
Stan
Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
Ranger McFriendly
Well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song, shouldn't you have?! [The green hybrid is now over the masher, and Stan releases it. Moments later, a cube of twisted green metal slides out and drops onto the ground] Keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!
Keenan
They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!
San Francisco. Cartman is now in the Haight-Ashbury district. People look and move on
Man
Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.
Cartman
[checking in] Butters, are you there?!
Butters
[making sure the cord is taut] I'm here, Eric.
Cartman
I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
Butters
[now reading a map] You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
Cartman
Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
Butters
Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
Cartman
Turning right at O two four niner. [turns right at the corner and continues walking]
Dawson's Junkyard, day. Stan is still manning the controls. He drops a red hybrid into the masher, and a cube of twisted red metal slides out and drops onto the ground
Randy
That's it. That's that the last one.
Ranger McFriendly
Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!
Keenan
Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside! [the townsfolk hear the warning and run around all over the place. Keenan says softly, deeply] God help us.
Over Northeast Nevada, the speech's smug nears the supercell. From the ground, the smug is seen floating along quickly, reciting Clooney's speech. It runs into the super cell and stops talking. Immediately, lightning envelopes the super cell and spreads to San Francisco and South Park
San Francisco, under the Perfect Storm of Self-Satisfaction. Stuff begins to roll down the street on which Kyle lives. Cartman approaches his house
Cartman
Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
Butters
That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
The Broflovski house. Gerald and Sheila are thoroughly spent from the party, so they don't take notice of the storm outside. Cartman opens the door and the sound of thunder fills the house
Cartman
Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
Gerald
[Slowly, blissfully] Being smug is a good thing. [farts in his armchair, bends down to inhale it]
Cartman
Oh my CHRIST! [runs up to Kyle's room and kicks the door open. Kyle and Ike are as wasted as Gerald and Sheila are. They sit on the floor with their backs against Ike's bed] Kyle? Kyle!
Kyle
The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.
Ike
I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.
Cartman
[trying to shake Kyle to his senses] We have to get out of here! Now! [lightning strikes the house, which begins to burn. The lights begin to flicker, and the camera zooms in on Cartman, who continues shaking Kyle] Kyle! Kyle!! [the screen goes black]
Fade in to South Park, the morning after. People begin cleaning up. The storm dealt a heavy blow to South Park
Network Anchor
And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole.
Stan
No...
Randy
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.
Clyde
Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!
Stan
What?
Clyde
It's a miracle!
Downtown South Park, day. The Broflovskis are back in town, safe and sound and glad to see everyone. Everyone marvels at their return. The Marshes arrive. Stan spots Kyle and runs up to him
Stan
Kyle!
Kyle
Hey Stan.
Stan
Dude, what happened?? [grins]
Gerald
We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
Mr. Mackey
It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? [Butters looks to Cartman for any reaction. Cartman puts his left index finger to his mouth, indicating that Butters should keep his mouth shut about this]
Stan
[gives Kyle a brief hug] Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.
Richard
So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
Randy
Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
Gerald
And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? [everyone seems to agree and discusses it...]
Kyle
NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!
Mr. Mackey
But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?
Kyle
Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do. [silent reactions all around] Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
Randy
You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
Kyle
Yeah!
Randy
I'm... [puts his hands over his lower belly] I'm not ready...
Gerald
I don't think I can do it either.
Mr. Mackey
It's simply asking too much.
Randy
Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
Gerald
Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! [everyone likes the idea; they all disperse]
Cartman
[walks up to Kyle] Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
Kyle
Yeah, I guess so.
Cartman
We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
Kyle
Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! [turns and walks away angry]
Cartman
Ah, that's better. [smiles]
End of Smug Alert!

Cartoon Wars Part I
Stan's bedroom, night. Sharon is seated on his bed and is reading to him from a book called "The Bubble Gum Prince In The Land Of Chocolate." Stan looks up at her, half-asleep and smiling
Sharon
But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever. [Stan's eyelids shut themselves and his left arm falls a bit. He's asleep. Sharon rises from the bed and bends down.] Goodnight my little angel. [kisses him on the forehead, turns out the lamp and closes the door on her way out. Moments later, the door flies off its hinges and a frantic Randy runs in with two large plastic water bottles]
Randy
STAAAN!!
Stan
[awakens and looks around as the lights come on] What?? What??
Randy
Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE! [brings the shoes over, but yanks Stan along before Stan has a chance to put them on. As they go down the hall, Randy stops to get a vase and toss the flowers out.] Take this!! [hands the vase to Stan] We've gotta bring all the water we can!! [Shelly opens her door and steps out] Shelly, go get my gun!!
Shelly
Whats going on dad?
Randy
JUST GET THE GUN!! [runs down the hall and down the stairs. Sharon comes out of the master bedroom running while putting her coat on.]
Stan's house, front, night. The family exits. Randy has a sleeping bag
Randy
Unh, come on! [the camera switches to a wider view and shows everyone running around with all manner of items in hand. A man carrying a large first-aid kit trips and moans in pain]
Man
AWWWGH!
Woman
Oh nooo! [Stan sees Kyle in the crowd with his family]
Stan
Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
Kyle
I have no idea!
a red car runs into a light pole and its driver flies out through the windshield, ending up either unconscious or dead. A man breaks the display window at Tele's and runs off with a small TV. The community center has its doors open and people run inside it
Man
Take cover in the community center again!
The community center, inside. People try to find places on which to bed down for the night. A nake redhead runs around aimlessly
Jimbo
All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!
Linda
Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters. [moves to find him. Stephen stops her]
Stephen
We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him!
Stan
Dad? [Randy is cutting duct tape into several equal-length strips] Dad, what the hell is going on?! [Randy stands up and faces the boys. Behind him, Mr. Mackey and a man in a raincoat set up a TV]
Randy
A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! [Stan and Kyle look at each other and blink]
Stan
Sso?
Randy
SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people. [people around them begin to pay attention] Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
Gerald
[approaching in his pajamas] Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
Randy
Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
Crowd
AWWW!
Jimbo
How could Family Guy do that?
Sheila
Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
Randy
Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
Stan
Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
Mr. Mackey
Wu-we've got the TV working! [the picture comes into focus]
South Park News 4, Anchor Tom reporting
Tom
Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad is set to air tonight on Family Guy!
Sharon
Oh Randy, hold me. [Randy holds her]
Tom
The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world. [Live footage is show - a crowd holds an American flag aloft and someone sets it on fire] All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags and Family Guy posters. Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement:
al-Zawahri
[translated] We are so super pissed off at 'Family Guy'. 'Family Guy' isn't even that funny of a show. A jihad on 'Family Guy', and the 'Family Guy' nation!
Linda
So what happens now?
Randy
We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning, [dramatic closeup] then we'll know we're not dead.
South Park, morning. The sky is red as the sun rises. At the South Park Community Center, Mrs. Garrison opens the doors and looks out.
Mrs. Garrison
It's okay! [everyone heads out]
Randy
We're alive?? We're alive! [pumps his fists]
Jimbo
[listening in on a boombox] Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.
Crowd
Oh thank God.
Randy
Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.
Stan
They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
Kyle
I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
Kyle's house, later. Kyle leads the boys to the front door running and opens the door. They all go in
Kyle's living room. Kyle gets the TIVO remote and gets to work.
Kyle
Okay you guys, check it out. [begins scanning the recorded programming]
Cartman
You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?
Kyle
Dude, it's a good show.
Stan
Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.
Cartman
Yich. [Kyle has reached his target. The Family Guy living room is shown. Peter is in his armchair, the rest of the family is on the sofa]
Lois
Peter, I can't believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner.
Peter
You think that's bad? Remember when I auditioned to be David Hasselhoff's car? [flashback #1]
Peter
Hey there, Knight Rider. [Michael Knight climbs onto Peter's shoulders and they're off]
Michael
After those bad guys, KITT! [Peter smiles and his teeth glow like KITT's headlights used to]
Chris
Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?
Stewie
Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous.
Peter
Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain? [flashback #2]
Peter
[rings a doorbell. The captain answers, dressed as Capt. Kirk] Pancakes for you, Captain?
Soccer Captain
I'll be the Captain, and you'll be Tenille. [rushes away and returns with a wig and pale blue dress for Peter to don. Moments later the captain is at a keyboard on the front lawn playing a Captain and Tenille tune as Peter sings]
Peter
Love will keep us together
Kyle
Hehaha, heh.
Cartman
Yich.
Lois
But Peter, I don't wanna cook dinner for your ex-girlfriend.
Peter
Well, maybe we can just have tea.
Brian
You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith? [flashback #3]
Peter
Come on, Mohammad, let's get some tea. [Mohammad is covered by a black box with the words "IMAGE CENSORED BY FOX" printed several times from top to bottom inside the box. They stop at a tea stand.]
Mr. T
Try my "Mr. T. ...tea." [squints]
Peter
Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh.
Kyle
That's it? That's all they did?
Cartman
Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
Stan
What? What's the big deal?
Cartman
What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in silence] What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
Kyle
Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
Stan
Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
Cartman
That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
Kyle
Uhhh...
Cartman
I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!! [turns and heads for the front door, then turns back and aims his index fingers at the other boys] It's wrong! [opens the door, heads out, and closes it behind him. Kyle's parents walk in from the kitchen with their survival gear]
Sheila
Kyle? Kyle, what are you watchi-?!
Peter
Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake.
Sheila
Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! [Gerald arrives with a bat and begins bashing the television set to bits]
Kyle
Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!
Gerald
[stops once the picture is gone] It's okay... it's dead.
Sheila
You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
Kyle
Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
Sheila
You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
Mrs. Garrison's class, day. Class is in session, and Mrs. Garrison is at the board
Mrs. Garrison
Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad.
Kyle
No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.
Mrs. Garrison
Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.
Cartman
Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
Mrs. Garrison
Let's all look at why Muslims are upset: [turns and picks up a stick of chalk] First of all, in the Muslim religion, you're not allowed to have what? [no response] Sex. Good. [writes "NO SEX" on the board] There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world. [faces the class] Now, this would be fine except that in the Muslim religion you also can't... Anybody? [no response] Jack off. [writes "NO JACKING OFF" on the board] Okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion. [faces the class] And what do we know about the places Muslims live? They live in? [no response] Good, sand. [writes "SAND" on the board] Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too!
Cartman
Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
Wendy
[skeptically] ...yeah.
Mr. Mackey
[over the school PA system] Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!
Stan
The hell's going on now?!
The school gym, moments later. The teachers gather behind Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria as Mr. Mackey gets the TV working. The kids enter and are seated on the floor
Principal Victoria
Shh! Quiet, students, quiet!
SNN special report. A graphic about "FOX: CENSORED" is over the reporter's left shoulder
SNN Anchor
Once again: we have just learned that the Family Guy episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored!
Cartman
What?
Mrs. Garrison
Why would they-?
SNN Anchor
FOX Studios claims that the Family Guy writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view. [a shot of some townsmen watching the news at the bar] The head of FOX had this to say:
FOX President
Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't.
Randy
[angrily leaves his bar stool] FAMILY GUY!!! [throws his Corona bottle down; it shatters] I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!
SNN Anchor
Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat
al-Zawahri
[translated] Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!!
Mr. Mackey
Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay?
South Park Elementary, afternoon. The kids pour out the front doors
Cartman
Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
Stan
Does this mean we don't have school all week?
Cartman
You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
Kenny
(Like what?)
Cartman
We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
Stan
Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
Cartman
Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
Stan
To Los Angeles?
Cartman
If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
Kyle
Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
Cartman
Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
Kyle
All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
Cartman
All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny? [Kyle stifles an answer] What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle? [Kyle's jaw drops] I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. [walks off]
Kyle's room, night. Kyle's asleep when his father bursts into the room
Gerald
Kyle! Kyle, wake up! [Sheila and Ike follow him in] We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!
Outside. Terrorists run around with rifles scaring everyone else, but the military gives chase
Kyle
Dad? Are you sure there's time?
Gerald
This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!
Kyle
No!
Sheila
Wait a minute! [looks around and drops her stuff] Where's Ike?!
Gerald
[looks around and drops his stuff] He was just here! Ike!
Sheila
Ike! [Kyle goes back through the crowd to look for him]
Kyle
Ike? Iiike! [sees him] Ike! [Ike is headed for the Ice Cream shop]
Ike
Ice cream. I want chocolate.
Kyle
Ike! [points left] This way! [a flash of light fills the night, and Kyle shields his eyes from it. A bomb has gone off behind the ice cream shop and the shockwaves spread out, obliterating the row of stores before Ike.] Iiike! [races towards him. Ike is engulfed by the flames, flesh turning to bone]
Ike
[hauntingly] Kyyyle!
Kyle
[as his flesh is consumed by the flames] Nooooo! [sits upright in his bed and is quite away now. He catches his breath, then leaves his bed to check on Ike. He opens Ike's door and looks in. Ike is sound asleep under his mobile. Kyle lets out a soft sigh of relief]
Cartman's house, next day. He equips his Big Wheels with whatever he can take to keep him going for the trip to Los Angeles. Cheesy Poofs. Socks. Doughnuts... Kyle stops by on his own Big Wheels
Cartman
Come to try and stop me?! [...a bigger box of Cheesy Poofs...] It isn't gonna work. [...a can of Dr. Pep-er, a can of lemon-lime soda...]
Kyle
I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
Cartman
[...Snacky Cakes...] Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this. [...another can of Dr. Pep-er...] Especially one who doesn't trust me. [seals his knapsack shut]
Kyle
Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
Cartman
[turns around slowly] Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
Kyle
It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
Cartman
You know we might not even make it into the studio.
Kyle
I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
Cartman
So what made you change your mind?
Kyle
I got some sound advice... from an old friend. [they smile at each other. Cartman turns and hops onto his Big Wheels]
Cartman
Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
Kyle
Yeah! [dramatic shots of Cartman getting on his Big Wheels, then of Kyle doing the same]
Cartman
Are you set?
Kyle
I'm set! Let's do this!
Cartman
All right, let's roll! [they ride off, slowly]
Town meeting in one of the rooms in City Hall. Everyone is talking all at once
Mayor McDaniels
People! People, quiet, please! [the crowd quiets down] We must not panic!
Randy
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!
Mayor McDaniels
I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
Prof. Thomas
[steps up to the podium] Thank you, Mayor. [everyone sits] Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what Family Guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it.
Jimbo
So how do we do that?
Prof. Thomas
We bury our heads. In sand. [flips a board over to reveal his plan for disavowing any knowledge of the episode] We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand before the Mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all.
Stephen
No, no, wait a minute, [Mrs. Garrison looks at him] that's ridiculous. [Gerald looks at him] What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see? [makes his way to the board] If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it. [the other people there mull this speech over...]
Randy
I like the sand idea.
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, me too.
Gerald
Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. [everyone else agrees]
Mayor McDaniels
We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!
Out in the desert during the day, Cartman and Kyle ride along. Cars pass them by
Kyle
We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
Cartman
Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
Kyle
[puzzled] Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
Cartman
It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
Kyle
[races ahead] Whoa whoa wait a minute! [pulls a hand brake so as to block Cartman, then gets off his Big Wheels] This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
Cartman
Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
Kyle
But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
Cartman
[gets off his Big Wheels, his anger sudden and strong, and walks up to Kyle] Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! [turns and goes back to his Big Wheels]
Kyle
[realizes Cartman's true intent] You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air.
Cartman
Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, "Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?" "Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman." [turns and faces Kyle] I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
Kyle
What are you talking about?!
Cartman
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
Kyle
I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
Cartman
Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! [begins to walk towards his Big Wheels]
Kyle
No! [moves to stop Cartman in his tracks] I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
Cartman
Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
Kyle
[turns around to see] What? [Cartman shoves him to the ground from behind and quickly gets on his Big Wheels, and peels away. Kyle gets up] CARTMAN! [gets on his Big Wheels and gives chase.]
The highway. Kyle catches up to Cartman and then tries to run him off the road. Cartman recovers and Kyle tries again. Cartman pulls ahead and Kyle works on one of Cartman's back tires with his big front one. That gets Cartman to fishtail back and forth
Cartman
Kyle, stop it!
Cartman pulls ahead. Kyle can't catch up. A car goes by, and then Cartman gets an ingenious idea. He crosses the sandy median and continues down the highway the wrong way. Kyle decides to catch up with Cartman, so he crosses the median as well and pops up behind Cartman. Cartman looks over his shoulder at Kyle, then looks ahead, then looks in disbelief as a tanker truck barrels towards them
Cartman
Holy Crap! [swerves to the right]
Kyle
Ahhh!
Kyle swerves to his left. The truck rolls by between them. The two of them line up again and continue riding. They pass a patrol car, which turns on its sirens and follows them. Both bikes and the cruiser fishtail down the highway
Trooper
Stay on 'em! [the fishtailing continues, but the patrol car loses control] Jesus, Mary! [the car falls back into the median, flips over backwards, and falls apart. Cartman and Kyle continue on as fast as possible towards the setting sun]
South Park, next day. The sand has been brought in and is now being spread out, Mr and Mrs Tucker walk by with their son Craig; Mr Tucker holds a shovel
Prof. Thomas
If you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own. [the camera pans across as a row of residents already has their heads buried, with snorkels in place for undisturbed breathing. The camera stops at Stan.]
Stan
Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
Randy
It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
Stan
Yeah.
Randy
All right, make sure your snorkel is working. [Stan slips it on] All right, now get your head in the hole.
Stan
Dad, this is stupid.
Randy
Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it! [Stan dips his head into the hole and Randy quickly buries it] All right Sharon, now do me. [gives the thumbs-up sign, puts on the snorkel, and dips his head in the hole. Sharon buries his head]
Jimbo
[approaches Prof. Thomas with Mrs. Garrison] Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?
Prof. Thomas
Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand.
Farmer
[steps forward through the crowd] I'll do it.
Wife
[appears and tries to stop him] Dylan, no!
Prof. Thomas
You realize by not burying your head in sand, you'll appear to be a part of the Family Guy audience.
Dylan
Yes, I know.
Wife
Dylan, please, you can't!
Dylan
Somebody has to do it, Sarah. [strokes her hair and face] You run along now and you get your head in the sand. I'll be all right. [she looks at him, then cries uncontrollably into his shoulder. He looks at the professor] You have to understand... I'm all she has. [the other townsfolk look on for a few seconds]
Mrs. Garrison
[to Jimbo] Who are those people?
The Highway. Cartman and Kyle continue racing towards Los Angeles. Kyle is closing in. Cartman looks back and opens his knapsack, unleashing everything he packed in there. Kyle gamely swerves to avoid it all. Cartman opens the big box of Cheesy Poofs and pours out the contents
Kyle
[begins losing control] No! [his Big Wheels go left and he can't brake] AAAAH! [he jumps off as he nears the edge of a cliff] AAAAH! [the Big Wheels goes over the edge and starts bouncing down the side of the cliff. At the first bounce, a rear wheel comes off. At the second bounce, Kyle's knapsack flies off. The rest bounces a few more times until it reaches the ground below, upside down. The Big Wheels explode. Kyle rises and looks down at the wreckage. He nurses an injured right shoulder]
Cartman
Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
Kyle
You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
Cartman
[riding into the distance] Suck mah balls, Kyle! [Kyle sobs a little, then pounds his left fist into the sand along the side of the highway]
FOX STUDIOS, a heliport. A government helicopter emblazoned with the Presidential seal descends onto the heliport. FOX executives come out to greet the visitors. President Bush and Condoleeza Rice exit the helicopter with two Secret Service agents flanking them
President Bush
Are you the network president?
FOX President
Yes, Mr. President.
President Bush
We need to discuss this Family Guy episode, Mr. President.
FOX President
Mr. President, my hands are tied. The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Mohammad.
President Bush
But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security. They must be reasoned with.
FOX President
Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. [a close-up of Bush looking perplexed.]
End sequence. Cartman sneaks out from behind the Family Guy Studios sign with a gun and runs up to the front doors. He enters the writing room...
Announcer
Next week on South Park: The race continues. Cartman reaches the Family Guy Studio and learns the shocking secret behind the Family Guy writing staff.
Cartman
[...and reaches a slow, undulating glowing light, judging from the reflection coming off him] This... explains everything.
Announcer
As an entire nation buries its head in sand... [a city is shown with sand everywhere, with heads buried in the sand, snorkels out]
SNN Anchor
The idea has swept the nation! But where will we find enough sand for everyone?
Announcer
...and the battle between Good and Evil is finally waged...
Cartman
[he and Kyle fight in a burning studio] Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!
Announcer
Will the cartoon be allowed to appear uncensored? Will Family Guy be destroyed??? Will television executives fight for free speech? Or will Comedy Central puss out? Tune in to see Part 2 of Family Guy, next week, on South Park!

Lazy "J" Ranch, day. Terrance and Phillip ride their hors
Phillip
Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy "J" Ranch?
Terrance
It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. [the horse farts and its tail goes up like a flag. They both laugh. Terrance is still fat]
Phillip
Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? [Mohammad, covered with a "CENSORED BY CBC" bos, rides up to them]
Mohammad
Hey guys, how's it going?
Terrance
Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.
Mohammad
I'm here to investigate a murder.

Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show the image of Mohammad anymore. It's dangerous.
Terrance
But you ruined the whole show!
Network President
Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys? [farts and laughs. Terrance and Phillip look hard at him, their arms crossed] Aw, come on guys, give me a break.
Phillip
We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy "J" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!
Network President
Ey! I run this network, not you guys! And if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! NO Mohammad!
Terrance
But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!
Network President
I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.
FOX Studios, day. An entrance to the Studios is shown, with guards at heightened secuity. Cartman rides right into the studios with no one noticing him. Cartman enters the main building and approaches a receptioni
Cartman
Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
Receptionist
What is it regarding?
Cartman
It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
Receptionist
O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line. [points to her right. Cartman looks over and then back at the receptionist] That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether. [Cartman walks over and sees Bart Simpson seated in a chair, his skateboard leaning on it]
Cartman
Dude, can I go before you?
Bart
Eat my shorts!
The highway, dawn. Kyle, still nursing his shoulder, arrives at a truck stop and his eyes open wi
Kyle
What the hell is going on? [everyone there has his or her head buried in sand. Kyle walks among them] Hello? [stops next to someone in a red sweater] Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles. [tugs at the pants. The person waves. Kyle looks around and goes into the diner] Hello?! [a TV in the store is tuned to SNN]
SNN Anchor
...starting in a small town in central Colorado. The idea has now spread all over America. [a helicopter shot of buried heads everywhere] Muslims continue to riot in the Middle East, demanding that Family Guy not air tonight's episode. [more live footage is shown. Kyle gets close to the TV] Amd Muslim terrorists continue to make threats.
Al-Zawahri
[translated text reads] "Family Guy" better not show Mohammad tonight. I'm serious. "Family Guy" isn't funny.
SNN Anchor
Osama bin Laden had this to say:
Osama bin Laden
[translated text reads] If you look closely at the writing in "Family Guy", you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot, and I think that's totally gay.
SNN Anchor
Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy shows the image of Mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate. [a rifle appears next to him and a hand cocks it]
Trucker
[with rifle trained on Kyle] You one of them?
Kyle
Who?
Trucker
How come your head ain't in the sand? [Kyle is confused]
FOX Studios. Cartman is seated two chairs away from Bart. Muzak is playing in the backgrou
Cartman
So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?
Bart
I hate Family Guy.
Cartman
So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
Bart
Not nicely.
Cartman
Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
Bart
Cool, man.
Cartman
Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
Bart
Isn't that like, terrorism?
Cartman
...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
Bart
I could do that.
Cartman
This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
Bart
I'm a pretty bad kid.
Cartman
Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
Bart
I stole the head off a statue once.
Cartman
Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
Bart
[compares the two acts in his mind...] You got it, man. You got it. [hops onto his skateboard and skates off]
Cartman
Seeya.

President Bush
I want to assure the American people that as President, I have exhausted every possible solution. Unfortunately, Mohammad will appear uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven.
Reporters
[clamoring] Mr. President!
Reporter 1
[rises] Mr. President, can't the writers of the show be reasoned with? Don't they know they're putting the country in danger? [sits]
President Bush
I have come to... understand something about the Family Guy writing staff. Suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence.
Reporters
[clamoring] Mr. President!
Reporter 1
[same one as before] What exactly did you learn about the Family Guy writing staff, Mr. President?
President Bush
[thinks a moment, then leans into the mic and says in a low voice] I'm afraid that information is classified.
Reporters
[in unison] AWWW!!! [then clamoring] Mr. President!
TCO Reporter
[rises] Mr. President, can't you force the Family Guy writing staff not to write anything about Mohammad? [sits]
LSX Reporter
[rises] Couldn't you throw them in prison? [sits]
President Bush
Look! The fact of the matter is the Family Guy writing staff is protected by something called the First Amendment!
Reporter 2
And what exactly is this First Amendment, Mr. President?
President Bush
[beat] Uh you know, the right to free speech.
Reporters
[in unison] AWWW!!! [they begin to fight furiously and clamor amongst themselves]
Reporter 3
[rises] Mr. President, when your administration came up with this "First Amendment," did it not foresee a problem like this might happen? [sits]
President Bush
[beat] Well... We didn't come up with the First Amendment. It was already in place.
TCO Reporter
[rises] What do you intend to do about this "First Amendment," Mr. President? [sits]
Reporter 4
[rises] Forgive me, Mr. President, but this "First Amendment" sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob? [sits]
Reporters
Yeah!
Reporter 5
That's right!
FOX Studios, day, the President's office. The FOX President is discussing schedules with the department sta
FOX President
Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.
Receptionist 2
[enters] Sir, there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the Family Guy episode
FOX President
All right, let's get this over with. [Cartman enters the room leaning on a crutch]
Cartman
[removes his cap] Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
Staff
Oh, poor kid.
Cartman
You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened. [shocked looks on the faces of the staff] First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility. [coughs] Ow..
FOX President
I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.
Staffer
Sir, if we pull the episode, the Family Guy writing staff will refuse to work again.
FOX President
Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.
Cartman
I'll certainly do my best. [coughs] Ow.
FOX President
Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all.
Cartman
[turns and walks out, and says softly with an evil smile] Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
FOX President
What was that?
Cartman
[stops and turns] I I said "thank you." Thank you for listening. [walks out again]
FOX Studios, outside. A truck pulls up to the curb and the passenger door opens. Kyle steps out of the truck and closes the do
Kyle
Thanks a lot for the ride.
Trucker
Ey, it's the least I could do. I hope you succeed, kid. I really don't wanna see Family Guy go off the air. I love that show!
Kyle
I'll do everything I can.
Trucker
I mean, I know it's just joke after joke, but I like that. At least it doesn't get all preachy and up its own ass with messages, you know? [drives off]
FOX Studios, exterior studio wall. Bart is writing "I HATE FAMILY GUY" repeatedly on the wall, much as he'd do in the opening credits of The Simpsons. His skateboard is leaning on the wa
Kyle
[noticing Bart writing, but doesn't see the actual text] Excuse me. [Bart stops writing and approaches Kyle] Do you know which way the network president's office is?
Bart
Who wants to know?!
Kyle
Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
Bart
[eyes narrowing] The network president's office is in there! [points to his right, to a small red building labeled "154 c"]
Kyle
Oh thanks, dude.
Bart
No problem, man. [smiles, knowing Kyle isn't going to the right building]
A storage room. This is the building Bart pointed to. Kyle opens the door and ente

The Family Guy offices. The receptionist shows Cartman
Receptionist 2
[behind a desk] Hello Mitchell.
Mitchell
Oh hi, Miss Travis.
Miss Travis
The president has asked that little Danny Pocket here speak with the Family Guy writing staff.
Mitchell
[rises and walks forth] Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now.
Cartman
It won't take long, sir. [coughs with more energy] Ow...
Mitchell
All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny. [walks back to the writing area. Cartman follows.] You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff.
Cartman
[removes his cap] Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
The Family Guy writing room. Mitchell and Cartman enter and walk by the cubicl
Mitchell
Well, here we are. Danny, the Family Guy writing staff.
Cartman
[stops and stares] Wha? [before him is a wall tank the height of the writing room. Manatees are swimming slowly within, and a huge pile of plastic balls sits at one end of the tank. Some of them are snacking on snall fish] What are they?
Mitchell
They're manatees. [gray manatees] Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea.
Cartman
Family Guy is written by manatees? [rethinks] Of course, it all makes sense now.
Mitchell
They really are brilliant creatures. [the camera focuses on the ball pile] You see, the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls. [the camera zooms in and pans across] Each ball has a verb, noun, or pop culture reference written on it. There's millions of them. [A manatee swims to the left side of the tank balancing a ball on its nose] The manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank. [another manatee swims into the pile] Uh there goes Gretchen! She's comin' up with an idea. Oh, she came up with Gary Coleman. [another manatee reaches the combine and drops a ball in] The idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script. [the ball reads "Mexico" as it goes down the pipe into the sorter] Laundry Date Winning Mexico Gary Coleman. A perfect Family Guy joke! I can see it now!
The imagined jo

Back to the Family Guy offic
Cartman
Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
Mitchell
When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you. [looks up] Keith? [Keith, seated at the top of the tank, reaches in and pulls out a green RIVERDANCE ball. The manatees stop in their tracks and slowly drop down as the balls they're carrying slip away from them] All right all right, put it back in! [Keith drops it back in. The manatees respond quickly and resume work] Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees.
Cartman
Oh... yes, yes. Um [clears his throat and talks to the tank] hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
Mitchell
That isn't gonna work on them.
Cartman
Why not?
Mitchell
Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.
Cartman
[softly] Son of a bitch.

Kyle
[calling to Bart] Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
Cartman
[voice] Well well well! [now shown walking up to Bart, who's keeping watch while leaning on his skateboard. Cartman has a mean air of satisfaction on him]
Kyle
Cartman!
Cartman
Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
Kyle
You fat sun of a bitch!
Cartman
You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
Bart
Yeah.
Kyle
Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
Bart
Shut up! [points to Kyle] You shut your fucking face, man! [to Cartman] Did it work? Did you scare the network into pulling the episode?
Cartman
Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
Bart
Cool man!
Kyle
Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
Cartman
Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle, [turns and walks away] I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
Kyle
WHAT?!
Family Guy offices, later. The FOX President looks at the manatee tank along with the rest of the sta
FOX President
I don't understand it. What's wrong with them? [the manatees are floating aimlessly]
Mitchell
We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working.
FOX President
[concerned] But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they?
Mitchell
No sir, none of us did. [Cartman smiles and looks around at the results of his handiwork]
FOX President
Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!
Cartman
[hobbles up to him] Sir! Sir! [faces him] If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you. [they both turn to face the tank] Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
FOX President
You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!! [faces the staff] How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!
Executive
Twenty-five minutes.
FOX President
I gotta hurry! [rushes off]
Cartman
I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!

Cartman
Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!
Kyle

Cartman
How the hell did you get out?
Kyle
That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
Cartman
Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
Kyle
[seething in anger] You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!
Cartman
You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
Kyle
[checks his watch] There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! [runs off]
Cartman
[runs ahead and cuts him off] I can't let you do that!
Kyle
Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
Cartman
[takes off his mittens] Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable. [Kyle removes his left mitten with his teeth and spits it away] Let this be our final battle. [they put on their battle faces and begin fighting, which is shown dispassionately. It's all a long series of slaps] Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah! [they begin to move along a sidewalk] Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
Kyle
Ow. Quit it!
Cartman
Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! [throws him up against a wall. They slap each other some more and Kyle throws Cartman up against the wall. Some more fighting and Cartman throws Kyle up against a window, but they both crash through it into the King of the Hill offices.]

Kyle waits for a writer to stop staring, then resumes his attack] I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!

No more timeouts, fatass!

[gets out of the headlock, but the fighting resumes] Okay... Okay! Okay okay! [the fighting stops, and they're both panting] You win! You win. I give up. [kicks Kyle square in the nuts. Kyle doubles over in pain, coughing, and Cartman grins] Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. [Kyle is still immobile, but a skateboard whacks Cartman from behind. Cartman falls over and Bart is there]

Kyle
[runs in and interrupts] Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!
FOX President
Who are you?
Kyle
Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
FOX President
The end of Family Guy?
Woman
Mr. President, we need final authorization!
FOX President
Hold on, Julie! [covers the transmitter] What are you talking about, kid?
Kyle
Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
FOX President
You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?
Kyle
What manatees??!! [a fist knocks him away and Cartman steps in]
Cartman
Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
Kyle
[quickly rises] No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
Woman
Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!
Kyle
Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
Cartman
No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
FOX President
Ah... I don't know who to listen to!
Cartman
Okay, I'll make it easy for you. [pulls out a gun and aims it at the president] Pull the Mohammad episode, now!
FOX President
Okay, I'll listen to you. [gets back to the phone] Julie?
Kyle
Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
FOX President
But he has a gun.
Kyle
You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
Cartman
Shut up, Kyle!
FOX President
I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.
Kyle
Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
Cartman
Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
FOX President
I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.
Woman
Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!
Kyle
Do the right thing, Mr. President.
FOX President
How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.
Kyle
I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
Cartman
No gay speeches, Kyle!
Kyle
If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.
Woman
Five seconds, Mr. President! [the programmer J. Walker has his finger hovering on the button]
Kyle
[softly] Do the right thing. Show Mohammad. [Cartman still has his gun on the president] Do. The right. Thing.
Woman
Mr. President, we need a decision now!
FOX President
Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.
Kyle
Yes! [dances]
Cartman
No! No, I hate Family Guy!! [tries to fire the gun, but it seems to be empty. No bullets come out. He throws it down.]

P.F Chang's China Bistro, night. A waiter arrives at a table
Waiter
Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's. How spicy would you like me to make your Chang sauce?
Head Waiter
Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check.
Chris
[whispers] I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!
Head Waiter
Well what about the new waiter?
Chris
The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.

Will you just place our order, please?
Towelie
Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.

Everything okay here?
Male Diner
Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless!
Towelie
Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless!
Male Diner
Yeah? Well you're a towel!

You're a towel!

[stops] But first, maybe I'll get a little high. [pulls out a lighter and joint, and lights up. His eyes change color from white to pink] Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.

Towelie
Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick. [stops] But first, maybe I'll get a little high. [pulls out a lighter and joint, and lights up. His eyes change color from white to pink] Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.
Towelie, at home, night. He gets to work at an old typewriter: he puts a paper in and rolls it into place.
Towelie
I bet people can't wait to read my memoirs. [begins to type]	Towelie
A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS
By
Toweleeeie

This is a really good idea...

A publisher's office, day. The publisher reviews the first draft Towelie brings in
Publisher 1
Aha. Mmm. Yes. Yes, I see. Well, that's quite a fascinating story, you being engineered as a towel with a computer chip that determines dryness.
Towelie
Yep! And it's all true.
Publisher 1
Chapters 4 through 8, however, seem to all be about Doritos Brand Corn Chips.
Towelie
I guess I could edit those chapters down some.
Publisher 1
Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir, but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs.
Towelie
Huh? Why not?
Publisher 1
Well, just the small trivial fact that... people aren't interested in autobiographies of towels.
Towelie
Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.
Publisher 1
No. They won't. Because they're people. And you're a towel.
Towelie
You're a towel!
Publisher 1
No. I'm a big book publisher who's not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs. You're a towel.
Porcupine Press, day. Towelie leaves the building
Towelie
Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems. [pulls out his joint and lighter again] I'd better get a little high. [strikes the flint once, but doesn't light the joint] Oh, maybe I shouldn't.
Joint
But you have to think of somethin' fast, an' gettin' high makes you smart.
Towelie
All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time. [lights the joint and sucks some fumes in. His eyes turn pink again] Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? [grins a small grin]
"A MILLION LITTLE
 FIBERS"
The page turns and the Chapter 1 is shown
Towelie
[in the stacks of a library, he proof-reads] All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel. [crosses out "towel" and writes] person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels. [crosses out "towels" and writes] people. [the next sentence reads "But as I pursued my derelict..."] This is a really good idea.
Another publisher's office, day. The publisher reads
Publisher 2
Ogh. Oh my God. Uh I could not believe a human being has led this kind of life, Mr...!
Towelie
[wears a small fedora and fake mustache] McTowelie. Steven McTowelie.
Publisher 2
It's heartbreaking passages like this one: "I am a person who often gets hung out to dry by all those around me." I know this company would be honored to publish this book. I just have one small question first. You're not... a towel, are you?
Towelie
...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?
Publisher 2
Right, I'm sorry. [rises] Well Steveen, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now. We're in business, sir.
Towelie
[quite pleased] All right!
Oprah. Her splash screen comes on, the studio audience cheers
Oprah
Thank you so much. [the applause dies down] Once in a while I come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life. [holds up a book] "A Million Little Fibers" is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory. Please welcome author Stevem McTowelie! [she fairly sings his last name. Towelie comes out to cheers from the audience and climbs onto the sofa with some difficulty] Steven, when I read your book, I thought to myself, "How can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay?"
Towelie
Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow- [stops himself] person.
Oprah
You talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack. What would that do to you emotionally? You have been through... so much, [the camera pans down to her crotch] and I think that people all over America could benefit...
Her crotch
[in one UK accent] Oh God, there she goes again, babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on. She hasn't paid any attention to me in years!
Oprah
...a life that kept getting up whenever it was down...
Her crotch
Nobody knows what it's like to be Oprah's minge. All she does is work, never gives her ol' minge a nice rub now and again. A minge needs attention! At least a scratch once in a while!
Oprah
Well Steven, your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet, but I have some pretty exciting news for you!
Mingie
Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!
Oprah
And so, Steven, I'm making your book my official Book of the Month selection! [sing-song ending]
Towelie
Really? [the audience cheers] Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.
The book goes into mass circulation, the presses printing, cutting and binding at a fast pace. The paper cover goes on last, and the new book drops through a trap floor into a waiting cardboard box with more copies of the book within. The cover is shown and the box closed and shipped out. Next, Towelie is at a book-signing at Frontier Books autographing the books of a line of waiting readers. Posters promoting his book appear on the sides of buses, another shot of Towelie signing books at Frontier as dollar signs float by, a man checking the book out through a window at Tiara Books, shoppers buying the book at Barnes & Legal as Towelie floats by with his bong
Oprah's office. She has a lovely Persian rug there.
Oprah
[talking to her programming people] Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can get her in as a guest on the 19th. All right, is John Travolta available to be a guest the week after that? Okay, that might work better since it's Sweeps Week.
Mingie
Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!
A voice
[in a different UK accent] Oh stop your complainin'! I'm tryin' to sleep back here.
Mingie
Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?
Gary
Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.
Mingie
Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.
Gary
Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass.
Mingie
She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.
Gary
Well that'll never happen.
Mingie
Not unless she gets fired.
Gary
[wonders] Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?
Mingie
That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.
Gary
Ooo. How d'you know?
Mingie
[low, ominous voice] I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.
Gary
'Ow do we get proof?
Mingie
We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.
Geraldo Rivera's office, evening. Geraldo is busy writing up a report
Butler
Mr. Rivera.
Geraldo
What is it, Dimitri?
Dimitri
There's somebody on the phone to speak with you. He says he has inside information for you that may discredit Oprah Winfrey. [Geraldo stops, rises, and goes into his private offce, where he answers the phone]
Geraldo
[sits down] Thith ith Geraldo.
Mingie
[somehow on the phone] 'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.
Geraldo
Who am I thpeaking with?!
Gary
'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.
Mingie
Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?
Geraldo
[his left hand spread out over his chest] What information do you have?
Mingie
What'd 'e say?
Gary
He wants to know what information we have.
Mingie
Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you "wha' 'e say?"!
Gary
Stop wastin' my time.
Mingie
Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!
Gary
I didn't say "stop wastin' my time," Geraldo did.
Geraldo
What ith going on here?!
Mingie
Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk. [a few second later]
Gary
Hallo?
Geraldo
Who ith thith?
Gary
This is Gary.
Geraldo
Gary who?! What is your last name?!
Mingie
Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.
Gary
A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole.
Mingie
Aw you stupid twit!!
Gary
Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!
Mingie
He didn't call you "stupid twit," I did!! Now just tell 'im this:
Gary
The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel.
Geraldo
A towel? A talking towel? That doethn't make any thenthe.
Mingie
Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.
Gary
You'd be surprised at things that can talk.
Geraldo
What proof do you have of this accusation?!
Gary
Just look into the author of "A Million Little Fiyabers," and you'll discover the truth.
Geraldo
And how do I go about that? [click, and a dial tone. Geraldo tries to get the caller back on] Hello? HELLO?!
Larry King Live. The splash screen pops up
Announcer
This is Larry King Live.
Larry King
[Towelie is in the guest chair] My guest tonight is Steven McTowelie, author of the acclaimed book, "A Million LIttle Fibers." How are you tonight, Steven?
Towelie
Well Larry, I'm a little high.
Larry King
Your book has helped a lot of people beat addiction. What made you write it?
Towelie
Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-
Larry King
[holds his left hand up and looks to his director] What? What's that? Oh ex- oh excuse me, Steven, I understand that we have a special report coming in. Joining us live from Afghanistan, here is Geraldo Rivera. [a split screen comes up and Geraldo's feed struggles to come in]
Geraldo
Hello? Larry, are you receiving me?
Larry King
We're here, Geraldo. You're live on the show.
Geraldo
Larry, this brave reporter has been days investigating and researching, and I have come up with a shocking discovery that is going to rock the balls and ass of the literary world! Steven McTowelie, author of "A Million LIttle Fibers," is a towel!
Towelie
You're a towel.
Geraldo
No, you're a towel.
Towelie
Well you're a beaner towel.
Geraldo
What did you say??
Oprah and two agents looks on from her office
Towelie
I'm sorry. I'm high.
Aide 1
This looks pretty bad, Oprah.
Aide 2
Your fans look to you to be all-knowing and all-seeing, and you've just spent two weeks supporting a lying racist towel.
Mingie
'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!
Gary
Oprah's got egg all over her face! She'll have to retire!
Mingie
It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge!
Gary
And her Gary too.
Mingie
Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!
Aide 2
Oprah, we need to know what we're going to do.
Oprah
What's the big deal? His book helped people. Why does it matter than he made some stuff up? Are people really going to be that mad?
A Marryot Hotel, outside, day. Towelie looks down at the crowd from his hotel window. A large group has signs calling hima LIAR and demanding that he be put on trial or punished. More signs demand refunds on the books the bearers bought.
Protester 1
Your book got me to give up alcohol! But I thought you were a person!
Protester 2
Yeah, we want our money back, you dumb towel!
Latino Protesters
¡No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye? ¡No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye?
Towelie
Oh God, I'm really in trouble now. [his phone rings and he answers] Hello?
Oprah
Steven, it's Oprah. Can you come on my show again tomorrow?
Towelie
Why?
Oprah
We need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to "heighten" certain things to make the book more relevant to people.
Towelie
Hey yeah.
Oprah
Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay?
Towelie
Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.
Oprah
See you tomorrow.
Towelie
All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say. [gets out his joint and lighter] Maybe I should get a little high. [stops himself] No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. [closes his lighter]
Joint
Aw, come on. You need to come up with ideas of what to say on Oprah.
Towelie
But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.
Joint
Yeah. That's why you should only get a little high.
Towelie
Well, maybe just a little high. [lights up and starts tokin']
Oprah. Towelie returns for a second interview with her
Oprah
Today my guest is once again Steven McTowelie, whose memoirs many of you purchased after I made it my Book of the Month Selection. [a sea of angry faces looks back at the stage]
Mingie
Ya hear that, Gary? Nobody's applaudin'!
Gary
Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great!
Oprah
Now, it turns out that your name isn't really Steven. It's Towelie, correct?
Towelie
[sheepishly] Yeah.
Oprah
And you are a towel.
Towelie
Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah.
Oprah
Can you explain to the audience why you said you weren't a towel before?
Towelie
Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...
Oprah
Was it that you thought embellishing the story was okay if it helped people?
Towelie
Yeah. Yeah, that's it!
Oprah
Well you know what I think, Towelie? I think you're a LYING SACK OF SHIT! [the audience is a little shocked] You lied to all these people, and for what??!! To make money!! They bought your book thinking it was true!!
Man 1
That's right!
Man 2
Yeah.
Towelie
But I thought you said-
Oprah
How DARE you like to me and make me look foolish?!
Mingie
What's this? What's she doin'?
Gary
I don't understand, Mingie.
Oprah
You think writing is a joke, you stupid towel?!
Man 3
Yeah, you you get him, Oprah!
Audience
Yeah!
Oprah
You will not get away with this!
Mingie
She's getting everyone back on er side! Oh, tha' clever cow!
Oprah
You lied to me, Towelie! And therefore you have lied to America! [stands up] We are going to rise up against you! [the audience cheers her on] Is this audience ready for a good old-fashioned lynching?!
Audience
Yeah!
Towelie
Huh?
Oprah
Audience, if you look under your seats, you'll find your very own torches! [the audience members reach down under their seats and pull up the torches they find there]
Audience
Whoa.
Gary
Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris?
Mingie
There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!
Gary
No!
Oprah
We'll give you a five-second headstart. [lights up her torch] One. Two. [throws away her lighter. Towelie hops off and starts running]
Towelie
Hoooo!
Oprah
Let's get him! [turns right and chases him]
Woman
Burn him! Burn the towel!
Man 4
Burn that which lies to Oprah!
The Chicago streets. Towelie is running for his life, with Oprah and her audience in hot pursuit. Towelie rounds a corner and enters the First National Bank of Chicago. Towelie tries to get in, but finds he can't open the doors. Oprah and her audience quickly surround him at the doors.
Oprah
Looks like your time is up, Towelie! I've led my adoring fans RIGHT to you!
Man 5
All right Oprah!
Oprah
I've shown my fans that... ugh! Ow! Wha?? [her pants rip open over her crotch and a handgun pops out]
Mingie
All right! Everyone back! Get back I said! [takes control of Oprah's body and turns her around. The fans cower]
Oprah
What the hell is this??!!
Mingie
[waves the gun around] Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!
Gary
Mingie, what're you doin'?
Mingie
Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another! [a police officer shows up, gun at the ready]
Oprah
What is going on??!!
Mingie
[aims the gun at Oprah's head] Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out! [aims it at the police officer] I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!
Gary
Mingie, have you lost your mind?
Mingie
Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!
Gary
Not like this, Mingie. Not like this!
Officer
[approaching cautiously, ready to fire his gun] All right, gig is up. Put down the gun!
Mingie
Stay back, mate!
Officer
Drop the gun and step away.
Mingie
I'm warnin' you!
Officer
[takes a few steps forward] Put it down, I said- [a gunshot hits him in the chest] Augh! [falls onto his knees] Gawhh [falls forward and dies]
Gary
Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead!
Mingie
No turnin' back now, Gary.
Gary
Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh.
Mingie
Oh keep your head, Gary.
Gary
I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke! [moments later he begins to puke]
Mingie
Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up! [moments later he begins to puke. Everyone is looking on in amazement. One of the fans begins to move slowly away from Oprah, but Mingie notices and aims the gun at him] Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want!
Man 6
Oh my God, what are we goinna do?
Man 7
You got us into this, towel. Think of somethin'!
Towelie
All right, I'm gonna get a little high. [sets up to light the joint, but stops himself again] No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!
HBC World News
Geraldo
I'm standing in the business district of central Chicago, where Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer and taken several people hostage. It is yet unconfirmed but believed that Oprah's asshole may be an accomplice in this as well.
SWAT Officer 1
Got the walkie-talkie you asked for.
Mingie
Put it underneath me. [the SWAT officer bends down and place the walkie-talkie underneath Mingie] Slowly, mate, slowly! [the officer slides it in place] Now back off. [the officer backs away] All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button. [click] This is Oprah's minge!
Lt. Nelson
Hellow, I'm Lieutenant Nelson. What are your demands?
Mingie
I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.
Lt. Nelson
All right, how about fresh underwear for one hostage.
Mingie
I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick!
Lt. Nelson
All right, we'll work on it. Don't do anything foolish. [turns off the walkie talkie] We don't have any time; this is the most unstable vagina I've ever talked to.
SWAT Officer 2
O'Reilly, you got a shot?
O'Reilly
[from a nearby rooftop] I got it. [has his sights on Oprah's minge]
Lt. Nelson
[shifting gears] Not with those hostages so close! It's too risky!
Gary
Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us.
Mingie
Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life.
Gary
[emotional] Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.
Mingie
We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me.
SWAT Officer 3
Oprah's vagina, this is your last warning! Put down the gun!
Mingie
If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!
Towelie
Hey wait a minute. [begins to move slowly, then quickly to the bank doors again. He thinks a moment, then slides in under the doors and stands up. He turns around and opens the doors] Pssst! [the hostages look and then move into the bank]
Mingie
I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen! [the hostages run through the bank and out the back doors]
SWAT Officer 4
Hostages are clear!
Lt. Nelson
All right, that's it. Take it out! [O'Reilly shoots]
Oprah
AAAAaaah!
Mingie
What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!
Gary
[softly] Min... [louder] Mingie.
Mingie
Gary, what's, what's wrong?
Gary
They got me, Mingie.
Mingie
No... Oh no!
Gary
Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood.
Mingie
Try to hang on, Gary!
Gary
Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge.
Mingie
Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into?
Gary
I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie!
Mingie
I'm 'ere, Gary!
Gary
Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris?
Mingie
Yeah. Yeah, we're in Paris, mate.
Gary
Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?
Mingie
Ih, it's beautiful. We've finally made it!
Gary
Tell me what you see, Mingie.
Mingie
[getting emotional] Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around.
Gary
Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I- [and no more is heard from him]
Mingie
Gary? Gary, say somethin'. [Gary craps his last, or maybe it's just a final fart] You killed him, you bastards! He didn't even want any part in this! This is all your fault, you stupid cow! You never gave your ol' Gary the time of day and now he's gone! Life ain't worth livin' any more! What's the use?! ...I'm comin' to see you, Gary! [the gun is cocked] I'm comin' to see ya!
Oprah
No! Don't! [the gun goes off. Moments later, Oprah is put on a gurney and wheeled over to a waiting ambulance, and rolled in]
Lt. Nelson
Oprah's going to be okay. Wish I could say the same for her vagina and asshole.
Detective
That's a great idea you had to sneak the hostages inside the bank.
Man 7
Yeah, it sure was. We're sorry we tried to burn you and murder you before.
Towelie
Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. [whips out his joint and lighter]
Joint
Youuu said it. [Towelie lights it up and chugs away]
End of A Million Little Fibers

ManBearPig
South Park Elementary school gym, day. The student body is gathered there to hear from a guest speaker. Mr. Mackey is presiding
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?
Kyle
Dick Cheney?
Mr. Mackey
No, the last one.
Butters
Bill Clinton.
Mr. Mackey
No, Clinton's vice-president. [no one has an answer] He is here today to talk to you students about some very serious issues. Please welcome Al Gore. [some applause. Al Gore arrives and Mr. Mackey steps away to one side]
Stan
Who?
Al Gore
Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about... [a projector comes on and a picture of a monster appears] ManBearPig. [a beast with the legs and tail of a pig, the body and arms of a bear, and the face and upper-body posture of a man]
Kyle
[softly, to Stan] ManBearPig? [Stan just turns his hands up and shrugs]
Al Gore
It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial. [Mr. Mackey and Mrs. Garrison just look at each other.] But have no fear, because I am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say "Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome." The end.
Mr. Mackey
[reappears and claps a little] Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore.
Al Gore
Thank you, class. Excelsior! [Stan and Kyle just blink at each other]
South Park, evening. The boys are playing basketball in a neighborhood park. Cartman has possession of the ball
Cartman
[giggles as he dribbles] Check out this sweet move. [tries to dribble around Kyle, but Kyle blocks him] Kyle, you can't block like that.
Kyle
Just play the game, fatass!
Stan
[open under the net] Pass it to me, Cartman?
Cartman
Hang on. I'm going to do something killer. [tries to fake Kyle out, but Kyle taps the ball away. Cartman goes after it] God damnit, stop it, Kyle!
nearby, as the moon rises over the mountains, a shadow moves across the forest, its claws fairly visible
Cartman
[tries again, moving Kyle back some] All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. [keeps dribbling without making a move]
Kyle
Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
the beast moves closer to some bushes, then stands up and sees the basketball court
Cartman
Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy! [again tries to get by Kyle, but Kyle taps the ball away again. Cartman chases it down again.] Kyle, knock it off! [the beast breaks through the bushes and steps onto the basketball court. Cartman continues to dribble]
Stan
Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!
Beast
FOOD! [it's Al Gore in a homemade ManBearPig costume. The boys turn to see who it is] Don't worry, it's not really ManBearPig. It's me, Al Gore.
Kyle
We know. [several seconds of silence follow]
Cartman
Dude, what are you doing?
Al Gore
I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker. [Kyle looks at the sticker; the sticker has a "ManBearPig" crossed out by a red circle and bar, and the words "We must all stop ManBearPig" to the left of the ManBearPig] I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the "real" ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?
Randy
[waiting nearby in the family car] Uhh, Stan?
Stan
Oh, hey Dad.
Al Gore
[turns around slowly and waves] Hello.
Randy
[vigilant] It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
Kyle
Okay, Mr. Marsh. [the boys move towards the car]
Al Gore
Be safe. [the boys get in the car and Randy drives off. Al Gore looks on as they leave, then turns around and walks off in the opposite direction]
Randy's car.
Randy
Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
Stan
Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
Randy
ManBearPig?
Kyle
He's half man and half bearpig
Cartman
No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
Kyle
That doesn't make any sense.
Stan
He could be half bear, half manpig.
Randy
Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
Stan
But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
Stan's room, night. He's fast asleep when his phone rings. Stan sits up and rubs his eyes, then hops off his bed and goes to answer the phone on his desk.
Stan
Hello?
Al Gore
Hello, this is Al Gore.
Stan
[shuts his eyes and covers them with his left hand] Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.
Al Gore
I was the vice president.
Stan
I know.
Al Gore
Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.
Stan
Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
Al Gore
[several seconds of silence] Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either.
Stan
No, no, it's not that.
Al Gore
Yes it is. Nobody believes me! [gets emotional] I'm trying to warn everybody and nobody takes me serial! [begins weeping over the phone] I just want somebody in the world to take me serial just for once.
Stan
Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
Al Gore
No you don't.
Stan
Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
Al Gore
Are you serial?
Stan
...Yes, I'm serial.
Al Gore
[reinvigorated] Don't worry! We CAN stop him! Bring everyone you can to my ManBearPig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp! [hangs up]
A Komfort Inn, morning. The boys climb up to the second floor and walk to Room 2B
Cartman
Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
Kenny
(Yeah, I don't get it.)
Stan
Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. [the door opens and Al Gore greats the boys]
Al Gore
Hi kids! Come on in! [the boys follow him in] Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?
Stan
Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
Al Gore
[alerted, goes down on one knee] What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be??
Stan
NO.
Al Gore
Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.
Stan
Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
Al Gore
[an alarm goes off nearby] Oh my God! [runs to his control center and leans back in his chair to look closely at his monitor. He begins to type quickly] ManBearPig screen active! What is this area of Colorado! It's a it's a cave of some kind! [a map of Cave of the Winds is shown, with the target below the text blinking]
Kyle
Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
Al Gore
Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.
Cartman
Ah I don't think so, dude. [the boys head for the door]
Kyle
Yeah, we've got school anyway.
Al Gore
I can get you all excused from school. [the boys stop in their tracks and turn around.]
Cartman
You... have that kind of power?
Al Gore
Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!
Wonderful Cave of the Winds, day, inside. A tour group gathers to embark on its tour
Tour Guide
Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado. [his head bobs as he sighs] Before we get started I do understand we have a special guest in our group today: the ex vice president, Mr. Al Gore. [one or two people clap, and Gore smiles at the two ladies, one on either side of him] Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready?
Group
Yeah.
Tour Guide
Let's go cavin'. [turns on his headlight, opens the velvet rope and leads the group into the cave]
The tour.
Tour Guide
Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.
Al Gore
Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?
Tour Guide
[to Al Gore] Ahh, no. [addressing the group] Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's...
Al Gore
All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.
Kyle
What do ManBearPig droppings look like?
Al Gore
Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.
Tour Guide
These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named "The Hanging Mushroom." [a solid stalactite in the shape of a penis] And over here we have "Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls." [a massive stalagmite, again in the shape of a penis and two large testicles] And finally, of course, the "Two Sisters." [two smaller stalagmites, each the shape of a penis and testicles] Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees.
Al Gore
Groan! Groan! [this stops the tour and everyone turns to face him]
Tour Guide
Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?
Al Gore
Not yet.
Tour Guide
All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name. [the group moves forward]
Al Gore
[looks at an opening and motions the kids over] Kids! Kids, over here! Look.
Kyle
What?
Al Gore
I bet this is where he's hiding. [shines his light around] This looks like ManBearPig Central. Come on! [goes down the path he found] Come on! This is where ManBearPig is! I'm serial! [the boys follow him down the path. They have officially broken from the group.]
Tour Guide
In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear. [the cave begins to howl]
Group
Wow...
Woman
Take a picture of the sound, Steven. [her husband takes the picture.]
Al Gore's path
Stan
Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
Al Gore
[hearing the wind] Wait! Shhh. [concludes] Christ! He's here! Take this rope! [hands some rope to Stan] Be ready to tie him up! [brings out a shotgun] I've got you now, you son of a bitch! [begins shooting randomly, and bits of the cave ceiling begin falling]
Kyle
What are you doing?! [bigger chunks of cave fall between Al Gore and the boys]
Stan
Oh no!
Al Gore
No!
The Boys
Aaaah! [the boys are now sealed off from Al Gore. Gore turns around and assumes the worst]
Al Gore
Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!
The Boys
Help!
Al Gore
Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!
The tour. Chunks of cave begin falling along its path as well, and the tour guide takes appropriate action
Tour Guide
O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now! [the group turns around and runs back towards the entrance. The collapse follows the group] Go! Go! Go out, now! [the last person out of the cave is Al Gore, and the cave entrance is sealed shut by the collapse of the cave ceiling]
The inner collapse.
Kyle
Hello?
Stan
Help!
Kyle
We're trapped in here!
Cartman
Somebody get us some help down hyah!
Kyle
Hello, help!
Cartman
Hello??
Kenny
(Hello!)
Stan
Help!
Kyle
Forget it! They can't hear us!
Kenny
(What are we gonna do??)
Cartman
[pointing at Stan] You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
Stan
[faces Cartman] Me??
Cartman
You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
Stan
Maybe there's another way out of here.
Kenny
(Oh, no kidding.)
Kyle
A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction. [the boys split up. Kyle climbs along a pile of boulders] Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
Cartman
[scrambling along his own path] This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off! [loses his footing and slides down some distance to the floor. He gets up and coughs from all the dust that went up around him] Goddammit! [reaches down and grabs his flashlight. He slaps it until it comes back on, coughs, and looks ahead. His eyes grow big. Before him is "Smuggle's Den," a corner of the cave in which sits an open treasure chest and two skeletons guarding it. Gold and jewelry are in and around the chest, while the skeletons have guns in their hands. Cartman approaches slowly, in awe]
Kyle
You see anything, Kenny??
Kenny
(No, nothing!) [Cartman is frozen, speechless]
Kyle
Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??
Cartman
[in a soft, trembling voice] No, nothing [clears his throat and speaks normally] No, nothing here! Nothing this way! [his eyes fixed on the look, he swoons] Tr... treasure.
Kyle
Cartman, you okay?? [Cartman snaps out of it] You need help??
Cartman
I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! [turns to head back to the other boys, but turns around one last time to remember where the treasure is, then heads back to his friends.]
Kyle
It looks like we're completely sealed in.
Kenny
(Yeah, No shit.)
Stan
[returning] There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. [Cartman arrives]
Kyle
Maybe we should go for it.
Cartman
You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. [the other three boys turn to face him]
Kyle
Why?
Cartman
I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
Stan
Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
Cartman
No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
Kyle
No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
Cartman
That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there [points to his last location] if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
Kyle
Aw, dude! [lifts his jacket over his nose.]
Cave of the Winds, outside. Rescue personnel have arrived and make their way towards the cave entrance. the tour guide demonstrates on a map what happened.
Miner 1
The cave-in was massive. It has cut off all access in or out. The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area. [circles with his index finger an area on the right side of the map]
Miner 2
Does anybody know who these kids are?
Miner 1
No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days.
Al Gore
[arrives, interrupting] Excuse me, Excuse me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial!
Miner 1
What do you mean? The cave-in is over.
Al Gore
I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.
Miner 1
What's that? [Gore whips out a drawing of ManBearPig]
Fireman
What is that, a pigbearman?
Al Gore
No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!
Back at the inner collapse
Stan
I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
Kyle
They saw us on the tour. [Cartman comes back from the den] Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
Cartman
I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
Kyle
Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
Stan
Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
Sleep time at the inner cave-in. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny sleep. Cartman sits alone, smiling
Cartman
[softly throughout] All that treasure. [gets excited] It's all mine! [gets angry] So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it! [looks at the other boys] You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys! [begins to crawl towards Kyle] Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass! [reaches Kyle so that his face is smiling evilly down at Kyle's face. He whispers] Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. [Kyle stirs and wakes up]
Kyle
C-Cartman?
Cartman
[says nothing for a few seconds, then] Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
Kyle
Dude, what are you doing?
Cartman
Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
Kyle
Dude, get away from me!
Cartman
Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. [gets off Kyle]
Cave of the Winds, outside. The rescue personnel - rangers, firefighters, and paramedics - return to their work
Al Gore
[whining, stamps his right foot when saying "serial"] Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial!
Miner 3
Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down. Now, w-what exactly do you suggest we do?
Al Gore
I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!
Miner 3
Well, see, the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too.
Al Gore
They're already dead! Didn't you listen to me?? They got attacked by a ManBearPig and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive! I'm super serial! Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial! [begins to weep]
Police Officer
Do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here?
Miner 2
Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him. I don't think he has any friends.
Smuggler's Den, some time later. Cartman makes his way to it again with a bottle of water in his right hand. He heads straight for the treasure and cackles softly, then stops
Cartman
[determined] All right. Gotta be strong. [looks at the coins in his hands] There's still a lot more treasure to go. [begins to swallow the coins and wash them down with "WOTTUR." He soon runs into some difficulty swallowing and drinking, so it seems like he's puking. The other three boys are awake and listening with concern]
Stan
Dude, he's really sick. [Cartman has moved on to swallowing necklaces and loose gemstones]
Cave of the Winds, outside. The media have gotten wind of the story, so an HBC reporting crew has joined the rescue personnel
HBC Reporter
It's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in. Three days without food and time is certainly running out. The digging continues, but progress is fatally slow.
Miner 1
All right, people, we've gotta work faster! Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called Smuggler's Den.
Ranger
Smuggler's Den?
Tour Guide
Ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure. Here, see? [holds up a picture of two kids standing in front of the treasure]
Miner 1
Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put.
Back at the inner collapse. Stan is asleep and Kyle goes to wake him
Kyle
Stan! Stan, wake up!
Stan
[wakes up and rubs his eyes] Huh? What? Have they come for us?
Kyle
No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. [moves off, and Stan follows. Stan shines his light on Cartman, who's now overstuffed with the treasure he's been swallowing. Kenny holds the water bottle Cartman was drinking from]
Cartman
Meh, meuh urgh. [coughs] Mbeuh.
Stan
Oh my God. [runs up to Cartman] Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
Cartman
[cough] I'm fahn. Just a lit- [gulp] No big deal. [burps] Beh.
Kyle
[taps Stan and takes him aside] We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.
Stan
How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
Kyle
Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
Cartman
NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. [coughs]
Cave of the Winds, outside. The rescue mission continues
Back at the inner collapse. Stan, Kyle and Kenny have climbed out and have wrapped Cartman up to hoist him out. Cartman coughs as he rises to the top. The boys are pulling with all their might
Kyle
Come on come on! Pull!
Stan
Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!
Cartman
Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. [grunts, and a fart comes out. His face lights up in alarm]
Kyle
What the hell is that??
Stan
Cartman?
Cartman
You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! [the boys pull again.]
A river nearby. A crane approaches the river with a hoist full of boulders. Al Gore is manning the crane, moving levers here and there, positioning the hoist
Al Gore
This is the end of you, ManBearPig. [releases the boulders onto the river, and the water is diverted towards the cave] Excelsior!
Cave of the Winds, outside. The rescue personnel stare as they notice water flooding towards the cave entrance. The water enters the cave
Kenny
(We're almost there!)
Stan
[exhausted] I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
Cartman
Yes you do! [something drops, and the roar of flooding water is heard]
Kyle
What the hell is that? [the boys turn quickly to see where the sound is coming from, and the wave of water appears. Cartman coughs again. The water rises towards them.] Oh my God. [the boys back up]
Cartman
No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
Kyle
Ruuun! [the boys turn and run from the advancing water, but it overtakes them, sweeping them along]
Cave of the Winds, outside. The flash flood stops all activity
Miner 1
That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do!
Fireman 2
You're calling off the rescue?
Miner 1
We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead.
Fireman 2
Well what if the children aren't dead?
Miner 1
Look, the cavern is completely flooded. Nothing could have survived. There's nothing left alive down there. [the guide and fireman turn right and walk past Al Gore]
Al Gore
[softly] Nothing left alive... [grins] I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it.
Cave of the Winds, inside. The boys have been swept into a newly-made lake. Stan is the first to pop up out of the water. He swims to a nearby bank and holds on to a boulder. Kenny pops up next to him
Stan
Kenny! Here, take my hand! [Kenny does so and makes it to safety. A change of POV shows Kyle hauling Cartman] Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
Cartman
Grab my hand.
Kyle
Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
Cartman
I can't kick!
Kyle
Yes you can!
Cartman
I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
Kyle
I need your help!
Cartman
No, you just have to save me. [Cartman stops and begins to drop down to the bottom, taking Kyle with him]
Stan
Kyle! No!
Cave of the Winds, outside. The music indicates a funeral, and it is so. Al Gore is at the podium giving a eulogy
Al Gore
We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more.
Tour Guide
Oh Jesus, here we go again. [the mourners hold candles with little paper guards over their hands]
Al Gore
I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4. [off to the mourners' left, some rocks move and give way to a new opening] I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play. [a tour guide notices and watches. The rocks move some more and Stan appears] And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.
Stan
Agh.
Miner 4
[jumps out of his seat and stands up] Oh my God! ["Kid 4 was filled with hope and ... terrorism when..." Stan and Kyle work to pull Cartman out, but it's hard]
Miner 1
It's the kids! [everyone rises and runs towards the boys]
Miner 4
They're alive! [all four of them are out now]
Al Gore
[walks up to the boys] Kids! I saved you!
Stan
Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
Al Gore
[undaunted] Hyeah right. The man who singlehandedly killed ManBearPig is a loser. [grins. Cartman starts to groan]
Kyle
We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
Cartman
No! No I'm fine! [begins to walk with difficulty] I just need to get home, a-and rest.
Stan
Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
Cartman
[leaving] Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I... [stops] habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! [his pants rip open in the read and much of the treasure he had swallowed comes flying out of his body. Then he farts. A long silence follows as everyone looks at him and at the fake treasure he just pooped out]
Kyle
Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?
Cartman
It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
Tour Guide 2
Hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our Smuggler's Den photo room.
Cartman
That's right, and I... [looks at the tour guide] Fake treasure?
Tour Guide 2
Yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. All in all, I'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars.
Cartman
Noo... NOOO!! [craps out some more treasure] NOO! OW!
Kyle
You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
Cartman
Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!! [craps out even more fake treasure] Dowww!
Al Gore
[now wearing a cape, loosely] Well, my work here is done. I've killed MBP, and now I must save the world from something else. Maybe I'll make a movie. A movie starring me. Then people will take me super-serial. [runs off in superhero pose]
Cartman
Eh! [a gold-colored vase pops out of his ass]
End of ManBearPig

Tsst
Mr. Mackey's office, day. He's at his desk with Liane and Eric facing him
Mr. Mackey
Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!
Liane
Eric, why would you do such a thing?
Cartman
I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
Mr. Mackey
You know that's not the point!
Cartman
Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
Liane
That's very naughty, Eric.
Cartman
Well he called me chubby!
Mr. Mackey
We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home!
Liane
[agreeing] I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like. [reaches into her purse, pulls out a napkin and cries into it] I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day. [crying through her words] He just never listens.
Cartman
Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
Liane
It's not him, it's you, Eric. [Cartman's anger vanishes] I don't know what to do with you.
Cartman
Sure you do. You're a great mom.
Who's got the greatest mom in the world?
I dooo.
My mom is number one in my heart.
It's true!
Liane and Eric
My mom's the best mom, better than your mom.
It's singing together in harmony.
Mr. Mackey
Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?
Nanny 911 clips.
Announcer
They're every parent's worst nightmare. [Two boys are in a bedroom. The older boy jumps around on the bed and throws a blue pillow at the younger one, the younger one cries, gets up, and throws the pillow back at him.]
Girl
[in the bathroom with her father] Shut up! I hate you! I hate you! [runs away. Her father cries]
Announcer
Kids completely out of control. [a boy is at the dining table at home, next to a bowl of spaghetti. He picks up the bowl, turns it over, dumps the spaghetti to the floor, and wears the bowl as a hat]
Boy
[drops to the floor and slides around in the spaghetti] Look, I'm skating, I'm skating!
Announcer
It's time to call Nanny 911. [a silhouetted nanny walks in from the left and into the show's coats of arms. Next shot is a camera zooming into NANNY CENTRAL. Inside the manor the nannies are shown: Nanny Stella, Nanny Deb, Nanny Yvonne, and Nanny Skexis] We've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis. [five kids are on a living room sofa. One kid dances around, another repeatedly bangs an object on the floor, two others throw stuff to the floor] Parents of America, help is on the way! [Cartman is shown finger-painting] Tonight...
Cartman
[grabs a can of Red Bull. Several more cans are scattered around, and one of them has tipped over and spilled some drink] Mom, I need another energy drink! [tosses a can away. Next shot, he's in the tub taking a bath and farts. Next shot, he has finished off the tacos his mom served him and takes one of hers without permission.]
Announcer
This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.
Cartman
[from his days supporting Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ: pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets meesed up from the impacts]
Announcer
And Nanny Stella is selected to set him straight. [Stella, a stout blonde, walks toward Cartman's house, and people take second looks at her. She approaches Cartman's front door]
Stella
It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! [knocks on the door. Inside, Cartman is playing a video game. Stella knocks again]
Cartman
Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
Liane
[walks by] Yes. I think it's the nanny, poopsiekins.
Cartman
Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. [burps]
Stella
[Liane answers the door] Hello. I'm Nanny Stella.
Liane
Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. [shows Stella in. Stella walks up to Cartman]
Stella
And you must be Eric.
Cartman
Mom, I want a Twinkie.
Liane
All, all right dear. [starts walking, but Stella stops her]
Stella
Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done.
Cartman
[glances up at her] Ha! Hahahahahaha!
Stella
I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
Cartman
[mocking her British accent] No thanks, I'd rather naught.
Stella
Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. [takes away the controller, then unplugs and gathers up the rest of the game console]
Cartman
The hell do you think you're doing?
Stella
Come on. [leads Liane and Cartman into the kitchen and sets the console down] This video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. Now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed. [She walks off. Eric simply grabs the console and heads back to the living room, and she returns] Eric, no! This is not acceptable! [takes the console and sets it back on counter]
Cartman
Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
Stella
All right, that's it! [grabs his hand] You're going to time-out! [leads him away]
Cartman
Time out?
Stella
[takes him to a stool and places him on it as Liane watches] Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes.
Cartman
[glances down and thinks] And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
Stella
It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.
Cartman
[looks at her, then hops off the stool] Whoa, how did I do that? [walks off to get his X-Box]
Stella
Eric, you have to stay in time-out!
Cartman
Ummm, no?
Stella
[approaches him, takes his hands off the console, and takes him back to the stool] Come on, you don't have a choice.
Cartman
All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
Stella
[genuflects and addresses him firmly] Eric, you need to listen to me. [to Liane] This is very important. I am getting down to eye level with Eric so that I can talk to him on his level. [to Eric] Eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. All right?
Cartman
I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
Stella
Well then, I'll just have to stand right here! [Cartman snorts inward, gathering up a wad of mucus and saliva and spitting it at Stella's mouth] Oh! [Cartman hops off and walks toward his X-Box] He spit in my mouth!
Liane
Yeah, it's best to avoid his level.
Stella
All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
Cartman
[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
Stella
[genuflects behind him and embraces him] Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?
Cartman
Because you took my Xbox.
Stella
Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
Cartman
Well, yeah.
Stella
And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
Cartman
Yeah. I guess so.
Stella
[to Liane] See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?
Cartman
Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
Stella
Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you.
Cartman
Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
Stella
Oh, I just never had kids.
Cartman
Why not?
Stella
It... just... didn't happen.
Cartman
You're sterile, is that it? [she releases him, taken aback by that question] No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it? [her jaw drops] Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
Stella
Why you, you... [stands up] you little bastard! How dare you?!
Liane
Eric, naughty.
Stella
What kind of [picks him up by the collar] monster would-
Cartman
Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! [Stella drops him and steps back a bit]
Stella
That's it! [walks up to the camera] I'm not doing this!
Liane
Oh, but we really need some help. [Stella steps back to talk to Liane]
Stella
Find yourself another nanny... television show!
Next nanny show: A British flag, then a smiling nanny, then the nanny next to a British phone, with three kids next to her, then an early limousine pulls up and she gets inside it, then an American flag appears, then she's having dinner with an American family. Last scene is a montage of children she's dealt with over the length of her career
Announcer
Coming up next, it's Super Nanny! Where other nannies fail, Nanny Jo comes through. [a parasol appears in her hand, then the camera pulls back to show three child silhouettes on either side of her. The silhouettes jump up and down]
The Super Nanny's limo rolls up to Cartman's house. In the back seat, she's holding up a portable DVD player. A scene of Nanny 911 is playing: Stella taking the X-Box from Cartman after they enter the kitchen
Jo
This child's behavior is totally unacceptable!
Cartman's front door. Jo walks up and knocks
Jo
Well, there's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time you're going to see a new Eric Cartman.
Three days later, Slater-Carey Mental Hospital. Inside, a doctor is walking down the hall with Liane
Doctor
I'm afraid Super Nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis.
Liane
What do you mean?
Doctor
I mean, [looks into the nanny's room, 23A] she spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. [Liane looks inside through a window. Jo is glued to her toilet seat, eating her own shit.]
Jo
[Through mouthfuls of poop.] From heeell! It's from heeell!
Liane
Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.
Doctor
Well there... is... one more show you could still try.
Dog Whisperer title screen. First scene: two dog owners try to keep their angry dogs away from each other. Second scene, a Chihuahua tries to keep a lampshade his owner is trying to take from him. Next, a man runs through a meadow with four dogs. Next, he's skating down a city street with six dogs on leashes pulling him along. Next, he's training a dog at poolside. Next, he's handling a terribly agitated dog. Next, he's running along a shore with the six dogs he had on leashes earlier, now unleashed. Next, he's giving a dog's leash to its female dog owner. Finally, a montage of silhouettes with Cesar and a bunch of dogs
Announcer
When good dogs go bad, there's one man who's their best friend. Cesar Millan.
Cesar
No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer.
The Cartman house, day. Cesar approaches the front door and knocks. Liane answers
Liane
Please, come in.
The living room. Cesar walks in and quickly ignores Cartman
Cesar
So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?
Liane
Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.
Cesar
So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
Cartman
You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
Cesar
See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him.
Cartman
Not interested in me?
Cesar
See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.
Cartman
Yeah, well I don't see why-
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
Hey!
Cesar
Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.
Cartman
Mom, this guy doesn't-
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
Ah! Quit it!
Liane
What what is it that you're doing?
Cesar
Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.
Cartman
Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
KNOCK IT OFF!
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response.
Liane
Oh, that's very interesting.
Cesar
I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
Cartman
I'm not fat!
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?
Liane
Well, no, I don't.
Cesar
Go on, take your son for a walk.
Outside. Cesar and Liane are walking along, with Cesar holding Cartman on a leash and harness
Cartman
Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
Cesar
See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.
Cartman
Mom, this is degrading!
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! [begins to strain the leash, but can't get loose. He struggles to escape]
Cesar
Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. [Cartman tries to get loose from the leash, but Cesar reins him back every time. Cartman starts getting tired.]
Cartman
Maaaa. Mommm. [getting hoarse] Mommm.
Cesar
Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. [Liane takes the leash and Cartman goes to her left side]
Cartman
Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
Cesar
Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.
Cartman
Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
Liane
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cesar is pleased]
Cartman
Mom!
Cesar
Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!
The Dog Whisperer, back to the show.
Announcer
And now, back to the Dog Whisperer.
Cesar is in the living room talking with Liane. A bag sits on the floor to his left.
Cesar
It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
Cartman
[on the sofa to Liane's left] God dammit stop ignoring me!
Cesar
You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.
Liane
Ahall right.
Cartman
This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
Liane
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
Quit it, mom!
Liane
It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
Cesar
Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. [pulls a bucket of chicken out of the bag. He and Liane walk away from the sofa]
Cartman
Ooo, Colonel?
Cesar
I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. [Cartman hops down from the sofa and goes to the bucket]
Cartman
Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
Cesar
I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. [hands the bucket to Liane]
Cartman
Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
Cesar
We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
Cartman
[to Cesar] Goddammit, I am not a dog! [turns to Liane and hops up and down like an excited dog] Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken! [gets shrill] Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!
Cesar
[observing Cartman] We need him to become relaxed and submissive.
Cartman
Gih- [quiets down] Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
Liane
Oh, very good, sweetie.
Cesar
Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.
Cartman
Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
Cesar
See?
Cartman
Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me! [to Liane] Now hand it over!
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
You can't do that to me, I-
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman sits on the floor]
Cartman
Goddamnit, you just can't-
Cesar
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman is on his back]
Cartman
Seriously! Ey? Eh... [he's now fully on his back, calm]
Cesar
I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.
Liane
Wow, I have a lot to learn.
Cartman
[sits up, then stands] Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken! [Liane ignores him by looking up and away] That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine! [goes upstairs] I hate you! I'm running away!
Liane
Oh dear. [Cartman's bedroom door closes]
Cesar
It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.
Liane
But what if he does run away.
Cesar
Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. [they walk toward the kitchen]
Stan's living room, later. Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kenny are playing Monopoly.
Butters
[his turn] Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! [he and the dealer Stan exchange money through Kyle. Cartman enters]
Cartman
Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news. [sighs as Kyle takes his turn] I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
Stan
[takes his turn] You can't stay here.
Cartman
Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
Kyle
You'er not staying at my house either.
Cartman
All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
Butters
No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
Cartman
Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?! [Kenny takes his turn] His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people! [play continues] All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.
Kenny
(Fuck you.)
Cartman
Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere! [Butters takes his turn] Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! [walks out and shuts the front door]
Butters
[taking his turn] Whoopie! G and R Railroad!
Jimmy's house. The doorbell rings and Jimmy walks over to answer the door. He opens it and sees Cartman there.
Cartman
Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
Jimmy
Who is your best friend?
Cartman
You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
Jimmy
What's my last name?
Cartman
[tries to answer, but can't, so he leaves in a huff] Goddammit! [knocks on another door and Craig answers] Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.
Craig
...But I hate you.
Cartman
...Should that really matter at a time like this?
An alley in downtown South Park, during a rainy moment. Cartman sits next to a trash bin, shielding himself from the rain with some newspaper and some other sheets
Cartman
This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
Cartman's house, later. Liane is at the kitchen making a calligraphic painting. The front door closes and Cartman appears
Cartman
All right, I'm back.
Liane
Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.
Cartman
Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
Liane
Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.
Cartman
That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
Liane
Cesar...
Cesar
How is the painting going?
Cartman
Aw, Goddammit!
Cesar
Oh look it came back.
Liane
Yup, just like you said he would.
Cartman
What is he still doing here?!
Liane
He said he's hungry. What should I do?
Cesar
Well let's feed it.
an hour or so later, they're seated at the dining room table for dinner
Cartman
What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
Cesar
This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
Cartman
Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! [gets off and walks to the phone]
Cesar
Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?
Liane
Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!
Cesar
Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! [they walk up to Cartman, who's ready to dial]
Cartman
Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
Cesar
You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.
Cartman
I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-
Liane
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
Liane
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman drops the receiver and sits on the floor]
Cartman
Seriously! Mom-
Liane
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
Liane
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman is flat on his back]
Cartman
Mom?!
Liane
[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
Cartman
Mom? Mom...
Liane
[makes sure Cartman is relaxed, then stands up and turns to Cesar] I did it! [smiles. Cartman doesn't move]
The living room, moments later. Cesar is back on a chair as Liane sits on the sofa
Cesar
You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. [Cartman walks by, looking defeated, glances at Cesar, then at his mom, then sits by his mom on the sofa and cuddles up to her, a little warily]
Liane
Oh... Oh my gosh!
Cesar
See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state.
Liane
He's never done this before.
Cesar
Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
Liane
I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. [Cartman sniffs]
Cesar
Now you can give him a snack. [Liane offers Cartman a chunk of Candy, which Cartman laps up like a dog] Good, this is really good. Now try a command.
Liane
Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed. [Cartman doesn't do anything at first, then he hops off the sofa and heads for his room, head down] Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.
Cesar
This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.
Liane
I am the pack leader! [grins]
Cesar
Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
Liane
Sounds divine!
The bathroom. Cartman goes in to brush his teeth.
Cartman
Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?! [despite his indignation, he looks compeled to follow orders. He gets up on the stool, gets the toothbrush, turns on the cold water, and gets the toothpaste] Jesus. What's happening to me?
Café Monet, day. Cesar and Liane wait to be served as a waiter attends other tables al fresco
Cesar
So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?
Liane
Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.
Cesar
That's greeat!
Liane
The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
Cesar
Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.
Liane
There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.
Cesar
Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.
Liane
Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. [places her left hand on his right one - closeup shot]
Kyle's house, later. The boys have gathered there to play video games. Cartman enters, wearing a blue shirt and combed hair. He looks thinner
Cartman
Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
Butters
Kill your mom?
Cartman
She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
Stan
Dude, have you lost more weight?
Cartman
Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
Kyle
Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
Cartman
She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?! [rushes away and gets an easel with some schematics on it] All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked. [the plan includes blaming Token for the murder] You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
Stan
Dude, we're not killing your mom.
Cartman
Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
Stan
Where am I supposed to get a gun?
Cartman
Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
Stan
I'm not shooting anybody.
Cartman
Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
Kyle
NO, Cartman!
Cartman
Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?! [the boys ignore him. He gets pissed off and walks away with the easel] Fine! I'll do it by myself!
Cartman's house, night, the master bedroom. Liane is sleeping in her bed. The door cracks open and light enters the room. A silhouette of Cartman and a sharp object rises from the floor. Cartman walks in with a roll of paper towels in his left hand and a large kitchen knife in his right hand. He climbs the bed and stands over her.
Cartman
You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son. [Liane moves a bit] You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore! [he moves the knife to a stabbing position] Goodbye, Mother. [about to deliver the fatal stab, he trembles for a few seconds, but his conscience gets a hold of him. Cartman relaxes a bit]
Cartman's Conscience
Wait. Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom.
Cartman
[shakes it off] No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!
Cartman's Good Side
She isn't an object you can own. She's a human being.
Cartman
She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
Cartman's Bad Side
No, she's just... out to make you suffer!
Cartman
Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
Cartman's Good Side
The world doesn't revolve around me?
Cartman
[hops off the bed, dropping the knife and roll of paper as he heads for the door] Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. [stops and vomits some pretty black stuff. Could be the evil in him]
Cartman's Good Side
The world doesn't revolve around me!
Cartman's Bad Side
Idiot! [Cartman pounds the floor and gets up. For a moment he turns into a snowy screen, then into a red silhouette, snowy screen, back and forth as he fights his sides leaving his mom's room and going to his. At his door he turns into a blob, which is added to the silhouette and screen effects until he passes out in the hallway]
Morning at the Cartman house. Liane has showered and dressed, and enters the room with the knife and roll of paper towels Cartman left in her room the night before. She's wondering how they got there. She might have asked Cartman how they got into her room, but she's more shocked by what she sees next. Cartman is at the table doing his math homework and eating breakfast at the same time, quietly
Liane
Why Eric, you made your own breakfast.
Cartman
Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham.
Liane
And you're studying before school?
Cartman
Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
Liane
[a tear escapes her left eye] Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you.
Cartman
Tha... thank you?
Liane
I love you, sweetie.
Cartman
'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. [the doorbell rings and Liane goes to answer the door]
Liane
Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.
Cesar
How is the child doing?
Liane
Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.
Cesar
That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too.
Liane
You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.
Cesar
Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.
Liane
Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
Cesar
No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. [turns around and walks away. Cartman shows up soon after]
Cartman
I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. [waits a bit, then turns to go to his room. Liane turns around]
Liane
Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?
Cartman
No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
Liane
Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward? [Cartman blinks, Liane genuflects] And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.
Cartman
Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
Liane
[hugs him] Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. [A beatific smile appears on Cartman's face as foreboding music plays.]
End of Tsst

Make Love, Not Warcraft
Scenes from the World of Warcraft are shown. Various beings mill around. The camera pans down and a red-bearded dwarf walks into view.
Cartman
[as the dwarf, with mallet] Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
Kyle
[voice only] We're over here, by the cart. [POV switches to three other characters - a blue knight, a green lady, and an orange knight stand around waiting for the dwarf. The dwarf walks into the group]
Cartman
Okay, I'm back.
Stan
[the blue knight, with sword and shield] Dude! We've been waiting forever!
Cartman
Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
Kyle
[the green lady with big breasts] If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
Cartman
Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
Kenny
[mumbles, then] (I think Kyle has fake titties, hahahaha)
Cartman
Heheh, totally, heheh.
Kyle
Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. [walks off, and the others follow]
Randy
[voice only] Stan? [Stan stops] Stan?
Stan
H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.
Randy
Stan!
Randy's den. Stan removes his headset and furiously glares at Randy.
Stan
What?!
Randy
[displeased] You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
Stan
[swivels around to face his dad] I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
Randy
[stares, then gets dejected] ...I'm not a r-tard. [turns and leaves. Stan returns to his game]
World of Warcraft, the land of Azeroth.
Stan
All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
Kyle
See where I am? It's this way. [Stan joins the group. Kyle's character turns around, realizes its mistake, and jumps back around]
Cartman
Yeah, come on, let's go! [the four now walk abreast] I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
Kyle
Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
Cartman
Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
Stan
[stops and motions] Oh crap! It's that guy again! [a player approaches them and begins to dance. The character is wearing a helmet, boots, elbow-length gloves, and tight shorts. No shirt, no other armor]
Kyle
Who is this?
Stan
This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
Cartman
Get out of here, asshole!
Stan
He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
Kyle
It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. [the ganker jabs at Kenny, who immediately dies.]
Stan
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
Kyle
[in a soft feminine voice, makes a fist and holds it up for emphasis] You bastard! [the ganker stabs Kyle and then Stan, who both drop and die]
Cartman
Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?! [the ganker begins generating power] No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard! [the ganker shoots a fireball at Cartman] No! [the fireball hits and Cartman falls face down and dies.]
Cartman's room. Cartman looks stunned, then throws down his headset
Cartman
That sonofabitch!
Gerald's den.
Kyle
Who is that guy?
Randy's den.
Stan
[head resting on left hand] Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
The rogue's apartment. The rogue is actually an obese man who's taken to leaning back and playing WoW. Empty soda cans and candy wrappers litter his pad. A red glow emanates from his computer through a clear side panel. He continues playing while adjusting his glasses
Blizzard Gaming Entertainment, day, exterior. Lovely architecture.
Blizzard Gaming Entertainment, interior. A pool of telephone representatives fields incoming calls.
Rep
[female] World of Warcraft support line.
Stan
Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
Rep
O..ohhh that shouldn't happen. We designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other.
Stan
Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
Cartman
He's a God damned butthole!
Rep
Really? That's odd. [her co-worker approaches. She muffles the mic to talk to him] More people calling in about their characters getting killed. [removes her hand]
Co-Worker
Oh no.
Rep
Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network. [She muffles the mic] Better tell the guys upstairs.
Blizzard Gaming Entertainment, executive boardroom.
President
Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players..
Member 1
Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests.
Member 2
We've got to delete him from the servers.
President
We can't. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft so much, that he has reached a level we thought unreachable. He's actually able to kill our admins. And he grows stronger every day.
Member 3
Jesus...
Jim
[rises from his chair] I've gotta get home! My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now!
President
Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.
Jim
No... [sinks back into his seat] No... [frustrated] They just started playing!
Member 2
What kind of person would do this?
President
[walks back to the end of the table, by the doors] Only one kind. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we are dealing with someone here who...haw absolutely no life.
Member 3
How do you kill...that which has no life? [the question hangs there for a long time...]
USGS. Randy is working in a much better environment now - much more modern office, with several LCD screens around. Randy is online
Nelson
[walks into view] Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?
Randy
Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
Nelson
[walks up to Randy's desk] Is that a computer game?
Randy
No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2. [he moves his blond character around] I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see? [demonstrates.] "Hello." [the character waves back] In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. [the griefer returns and stabs Falcorn in the back, killing him, then walks away]
Nelson
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. [turns around and walks away]
Randy
What?? Why?? Why?!
Cartman's basement. Most of the boys in class are seated in chairs, listening to Cartman. In the back row are Tweek, Jimmy, Kevin, and Jason. In the middle row are Clyde, Token, Butters, and Timmy. In the front row are Craig, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
Cartman
My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
Kyle
The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!
Craig
He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!
Tweek
Mine too!
Cartman
We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
Token
Hey yeah!
Jimmy
We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
Clyde
Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.
Stan
Dude, we have to try.
Clyde
I've got better things to do.
Cartman
Clyde, Clyde! [moves around his podium to talk to Clyde more directly] If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it? [beat] I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
Clyde
[unshaken] I'm just gonna stop playing.
Cartman
When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
Clyde
No.
Cartman
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
Clyde
All right all right, I'll do it!
Jimmy
So what's the p-plan?
Cartman
All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30. [walks up to a map of their quest] We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
All
To victory!
Butters
I don't play World of Warcraft.
Cartman
Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
Butters
Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
Cartman
Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
Butters
O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.
World of Warcraft, near Westfall. The camera looks upon a meadow, then pans down to show a group of characters. Cartman is marshaling his forces.
Cartman
All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
Token
[playing a black warrior] Okay.
Craig
Got it.
Cartman
The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
Jimmy
All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.
Timmy
Timmy!
Cartman
This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth! [another dwarf walks in looking just like Cartman's dwarf] From with-
Butters
Hey fellas! [Cartman's dwarf looks over] Boy, this is neato, huh?
Cartman
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
Butters
I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
Cartman
You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
Butters
Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
Cartman
So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
Butters
[walks off grumbling] I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
Stan
Come on, let's do this!
Jason
Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.
Cartman
[turns around and leads] Then let's move out! [the others charge after him]
A field. The ganker walks along his merry way, but with one armswing he slaughters other players nearby with an energy blast. It's a very effective move.
Stan
Look! There he is!
Cartman
Everyone hold! [everyone stops in their tracks. The ganker turns around and faces them.]
Kyle
He's targeting us.
Cartman
Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click! [that sends the group charging at the ganker, who responds by summoning an army of giant scorpions] What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! [the actual rogue player is shown in his apartment, leaning back on his chair and playing without needing to think very much about what to do next. His character and scorpions decimate the group]
Tweek
Aaaa! [his character runs all over the place, with no one offering to smother him and put out the flames] I'm burning! Oh Jesus I'm burning! [a scorpion kills another character nearby]
Jimmy
Kenny's down. K-k-kenny is down. [Tweek is still burning, running around]
Ike
[purple mage] I have poop on my pants.
Kyle
Ike, look out! [the ganker rushes in and stabs him, and Ike is out of the game. Stan runs through a group of scorpions]
Cartman
All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow! [Clyde's character looks like he's about to swing at a baseball] Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde! [Clyde is at his computer, but not participating in the game. He's looking at Playboy centerfolds.] Clyde! Clyde, you asshole! [rushes to join the others] Goddammit we lost Clyde!
Nearby, Stan is fending off scorpions, and the blond hunter walks up.
Randy
Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? [Stan's character turns around]
Stan
Dad??
Randy
Yeah, I'm playing from the office.
Stan
Dad, get off our teamspeak line!
Token
[the ganker kills him] That's it, I'm dead!
Stan
[the ganker kills him. He throws off his headset again] That's it, screw this game!
Cartman
Now, leave me alone, don't do- [the ganker electrocutes Cartman with his dagger through the mallet] that, dugh [Cartman dies, and the ganker skips away. Cartman screams into his mic, then throws down his headset] God-fucking-dammit!!! [meanwhile, in his apartment, the ganker just keeps plugging along.]
The Blizzard boardroom.
Member 3
Oh Jesus...Oh God no...
President
What?
Member 3
He just finished killing every single player in the Arathi Highlands.
Member 1
How many people's characters were in there?
Member 2
Over five thousand. [some of the members sit down. Member 1 rises]
Member 1
There are over seven million people who log on to World of Warcraft! Are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die, and there's nothing we can do to save them?
President
Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft.
Member 5
[grabs his head] No! Nooooooooo!
The neighborhood park. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are playing basketball. Cartman enters the park.
Cartman
What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
Stan
Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
Cartman
Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
Kyle
We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
Cartman
I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?
Stan
We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
Cartman
That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
Kyle
Boars?
Cartman
There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
Kyle
Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
Cartman
Yes. [whips out a sheet full of calculations] Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around, [firmly] or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.
World of Warcraft. "Live to Win" by Paul Stanley begins to play. The four friends are back in the forest looking for boars. They slaughter the boars as they come upon the groups of them. Cartman chugs down energy drinks and has doughnuts and other sweets around his keyboard. He wipes his mouth dry with his jacket sleeve. In the McCormick living room Kenny plays while his parents argue in the background. In Gerald's den, Ike nourishes Kyle on the fly. The days fly by, starting at September 3...During recess and lunch, as the other kids play outside as usual, the boys are at computers at the school's computer lab playing WoW. As Tweek, Craig, Clyde, Kevin, and Token play football in the street outside, Stan plays WoW in his room. Day passes into night and back into day...
Paul Stanley
Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes!
Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall!

Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
Let another round begin, live to win
Yeah! [...and back into night...Stan's first pimples appear and his face is fatter.]
Live! [More pimples appear, and his hair begins to look matted]
Yeah!
Win! [He's gotten fatter than Cartman normally is, to the point where he's too fat to wear his jacket anymore]

The Blizzard boardroom. Executives are monitoring the gameplay.
Member 3
Sir, you'd better have a look at this! Four of our subscribers...They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks.
President
My God...they must have no lives at all.
Member 3
A hope?
President
A chance.
Paul Stanley
Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting 'till you fall
Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
Let another round begin, live to win
Live to win
Live to win
Yeah, win.

Kyle's room, 6:30 a.m. He rises from bed, which means he went to bed at 3:30 a.m. He's gotten as big and pimply as Stan. He hops out of bed, heads for his father's den and then to the computer and logs into the game to slaughter more boars.
Dialog
Kyle
Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.
Cartman
Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
Kenny's playing from the living room. Stan is at his dad's computer now, and Randy looks in on him. Stan earns an xp of 142. Cartman has gotten so big he looks like Jabba the Hutt. His fingers are shown up close typing away. Kyle flexes his right wrist and fingers to get circulation back in them, them resumes playing the game. More boar slaughter ensues. Next, Cartman is shown on the toilet crapping away and reading the World of Warcraft game manual. Stan's left hand is shown typing away. Kenny's still at it, but he's not as big as Stan is now. Stan looks like a huge baby...with pimples. Back at school, the boys are back in the computer lab playing away. As the music ends, Cartman raises his fist seemingly in victory
The Blizzard boardroom, night. The president looks out over the city from the boardroom. He stands at a table in front of the window, on which stand some WoW statuettes.
President
The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado.
Member 1
Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?
Member 5
[wearing a black T-shirt with the green words "Dwarf Needs FOOD!" on it] We ran the numbers: even with their amazing rise in levels, they have a 90% mortality probability. They'd be walking in a slaughter!
Member 1
There has to be...someway we can help them.
Member 6
What about...the Sword of a Thousand Truths?
Member 7
Quiet, Thomas! We aren't even to speak of that sword!
Thomas
But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.
Member 7
It is not an option!
Thomas
What is this sword?
President
Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.
Member 7
But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive.
Thomas
But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.
Member 1
Who foretold this prophecy?
President
Soltzman. He's an accountant.
The accountants' room, night. The executives open the door and walk in slowly, softly. Member 1 opens the top drawer and pulls out a small safe, gets the key and opens it. The President reaches in side and pulls out the small flash drive.
President
Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths. [the flash drive gets its close-up] We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them.
Cartman's basement, night. The boys have taken their computers and assembled them in the basement. They are all now connected and online.
Cartman
All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!
Stan
I'm in.
Kyle
Me too.
Kenny
(Me too.)
Cartman
[begins to slur his speech ever so slightly, giving it a blasé feel] Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
Kyle
Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
Cartman
Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?
Stan
+15 agility.
Cartman
Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
Stan
'K.
Kyle
Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
Cartman
Don't worry, I have that covered. [pressed a button on a small intercom on his desk] Mom?
Liane
Yes hon?
Cartman
More Hot Pockets!
Liane
[answering at the other end] Right away, hon. [Cartman turns it off]
Stan
That's übercool.
Cartman
All right, everyone ready?
Kyle/Stan
Ready.
Cartman
Let's go get him! [the battle begins. The rogue is playing with the right hand, eating a cookie with the left.]
Stan
Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
Cartman
Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
Kyle
What's the autolocate macro?
Cartman
Command-0. [sniffs]
Kyle
Okay, right behind Stan.
Cartman
Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
Stan
Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.
Cartman
Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
Kyle
Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
Cartman
Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
Kyle
No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.
Cartman
Christ...
Kyle
Cast on him again.
Cartman
Everyone target scorpions.
World of Warcraft, final battle. The four boys are attacking the ganker, who's just defending himself right now, mostly attacking Kenny. Seventeen hours later...the rogue is sitting up, signifying that he's paying attention now that the boys have battled him this long without dying. Meanwhile, the President of Blizzard and Member 1 arrive at Stan's house. Member 1 bangs on the door. The door opens
Randy
Yes?
Member 1
We are looking for a great knight by the name of LovesToSpooge.
Randy
That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.
President
Where is he?!
Randy
Who are you?
President
Sir, we don't have time! We just heard from our admins that your son's party is already in battle!
Member 1
Unless they have this sword, [pulls out the flash drive] your son's character is going to die!
Randy
[close-up, Randy's eyes widen] Nn-Oh my God! [drops his coffee cup and runs upstairs. The two other men look at each other and follow]
Back in the World of Warcraft the battle continues.
Cartman
Kyle! Fire spell!
Kyle
Aaaa... [starts generating the spell, but it abruptly goes out] AH! Huh?! [his character grabs her right wrist with her left hand]
Stan
Kyle! [Kyle leaves his desk grabbing onto his right hand, then flexes his right wrist around. Stan leaves his desk and approaches him] Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?
Kyle
Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! [pain shoots through his wrist as he continues flexing his wrist and stretching his fingers]
Stan
Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! [Cartman walks over]
Cartman
Wait, we need Ben-Gay. [waddles to Kenny's desk desk and pulls out a tube of the stuff, then walks back and squirts some of it onto Kyle's right wrist, then rubs it in.]
Stan
Hurry dude!
Cartman
I'm going as fast as I can!
Stan
Kyle, you have to keep playing.
Kyle
I can't. Just leave me behind.
Stan
We can't do this without you now! Come on! [he and Cartman help Kyle back to his computer]
Stan's room. The computer is missing. Randy and the two executives run in
Randy
Stan?! Stan! [turns around and sees Sharon walk by with the laundry] Sharon, where is Stan?!
Sharon
I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.
Member 1
Stupid?
Randy
Where?!
Sharon
I don't know.
Randy
Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!
Sharon
So what?
The three men
So what?! [Sharon rolls her eyes and walks away]
President
We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail.
Member 1
Ih if we could get to a computer, we could sign on to the World of Warcraft and give the boys the sword online.
President
I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you?
Member 1
No, I have a life. [the men fall silent]
Randy
Give me the sword.
Member 1
You?
Randy
I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.
Member 1
We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb!
Randy
Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword. [Member 1 kneels and reverently gives the USB drive to Randy. Randy holds it above his head like an actual sword] Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! [runs out of the house with the other two men behind him]
Outside, night, snowing.
Randy
Where's your car?
Member 1
We took a cab here!
Randy
Dammit, mine's in the shop! [runs out into the street] Uh hey! Eh help! Stop! [a car slows down] Please, it's an emergency! [the driver opens his door, Randy yanks him out and knocks him out with one punch. Randy and the other two men get in the car and speed away. The driver comes to and looks on. Randy is now on his cell phone] Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
The rogue's apartment, day. He's eating tortilla chips. Part of one falls onto his shirt. He looks at it and scoots it off, then goes back to playing without missing a beat.
Cartman's basement. The boys haven't missed a beat either.
Cartman
All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...
Stan
You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
Cartman
It's okay. [clicks on the intercom] Mom? Bathroom!
Liane
What hon?
Cartman
Bathroom! Bathroom! [clicks off. A second later Liane goes into the basement with a bedpan. Cartman sense this and lowers his pants as Liane positions the bedpan in place. Cartman lets go and a log comes out first, followed by a spattering stream of crap. Some of it ends up on the floor, some of it on Liane's blouse. Nasty.]
Liane
Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? [walks away with the poop. Cartman lifts his pants back in place without cleaning his ass]
Cartman
All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
The road, night. Randy hangs up and rests his cell phone when he notices a Best Buy off to his left. He pulls into the parking lot and runs into the store. He grabs a greeter.
Randy
World of Warcraft! I need to play!
Greeter
Our demo is set up right over by the- [Randy runs to the demo. A small boy is playing the game. Randy shoves him off and logs him out.]
Randy
Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in! [puts on the headset]
Cartman's basement.
Stan
Dude, I'm almost dead.
Cartman
Kyle, cast arcane missile!
Kyle
I'm out of mana, I told you.
Within the game.
Stan
[his character leaves the battle] I've gotta heal. [his character turns to see the battle]
Randy
Staaan! [Stan's character looks around trying to determine where the voice is coming from, then turns around]
Stan
Dad? Not now!
Randy
Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this. [holds the Sword of a Thousand Truths aloft] This sword can completely drain his mana.
Stan
Dad, how did you get that?!
Randy
No time! Just take it! Here! [the sword stays fixed to his left hand] ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?
Stan
Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
Randy
Okay. [The ganker notices the lull in action and faces Stan. Cartman is alarmed and spins around to look at Stan.]
Cartman
Stan, what the hell are you doing?! [the ganker runs and leaps toward Stan and Randy]
Stan
I got it! [the ganker stabs Randy and Randy goes down]
Randy
Augh!
Stan
Dad!
Randy
Stan... [falls down face first]
Stan
Dad, no! [turns around to face the ganker] You killed my father. [walks up to the ganker and strikes him with one blow of the sword. The ganker's defenses start to crack.]
Cartman
His shield and armor spells are down!
Kyle
Attack! [Kenny quickly takes his bow and arrow and fires an arrow into the ganker's chest. Kyle fires an energy ball at the ganker. The energy ball knocks the knife from the ganker's hand and disables him some more. He falls to the ground on all fours, and the dwarf approaches him, ready to smash the ganker's head in with the mallet]
Cartman
Looks like you're about to get pwned. [swings back and then pulls the mallet forward] Heeyeah! [the mallet smashed the ganker's head into little bloody pieces.]
The rogue's apartment. The rogue sits at his desk as usual, but now his mouth is slightly open in astonishment. Random noises follow, and his game is through.
Within the game, Stan throws away the Sword of a Thousand Truths and rushes up to his father's dying character. He shakes the character around a bit
Stan
Dad? Dad?
Randy
[answers] Staaan. [falters a bit, but Stan holds him up] I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.
Stan
I know you do, Dad.
Randy
[swats Stan's hand away] Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
Randy continues the melodrama at the demo desk in Best Buy.
Member 1
They did it!
President
Our world is saved! [Randy smiles]
Within the game. The boys' characters gather around the fallen ganker. Other characters appear and gather around the group
Man 1
They did it! They killed him! [leaves his hiding place. Others follow]
Man 2
They did it!
Woman
They killed him! We can come out!
Cartman
Yes!
Stan
We did it!
Cartman
Yeah!
Cartman's basement.
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
Yeah yeah.
Cartman
All right, yay.
Kenny
(Woohoo! Oh man!)
Cartman
We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
Kyle
That was such über pwnage
Stan
I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
Cartman
What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
Kyle
Oh yeah.
Cartman
Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
Stan
Got it.
End of Make Love, Not Warcraft


Mystery of the Urinal Deuce
South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade classroom, day. Mrs. Garrison launches into her lesson
Mrs. Garrison
And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like- [the door opens and Mr. Mackey enters the classroom, looking quite pissed. Mr. Mackey walks by Mrs. Garrison without saying a word] Oh hello, Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey
[faces the class] All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay? [the girls leave their seats and go into the hall] Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! [Mrs. Garrison's jaw drops at the behavior, then she gets concerned. The boys just blink at Mr. Mackey]
Butters
What's a urinal?
Stan
A wall toilet for peeing in.
Mr. Mackey
And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!
Jimmy
Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
Cartman
Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
Kyle
Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
Cartman
Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
Mr. Mackey
Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?! [the boys just laugh] Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!
Men's- er, Boys' Room, later. The police are in there with Mr. Mackey. Police tape has been placed around the urinal
Officer 1
I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on.
Mr. Mackey
But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
Officer 1
But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
A montage of the Hardly Boys follows. The following titles appear: The Secret of the Lost Tunnel, The Hooded Hawk Mystery, The Clue of the Broken Blade, The Mystery of the Spiral Bridge...
Narrator
The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in: [the cover of book 37 is shown] The Mystery of the Urinal Turd.
The Hardly Boys are now with the police officer in front of the boys' room. Mr. Mackey observes nearby. The Boys have screwed-up smiles, suggesting buck teeth
Officer 1
So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime.
Frank
That sure is a mystery.
Joe
Yeah, it sounds super-hard.
Frank
Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue.
Joe
F-really?
Frank
Yeah, this is totally giving me a clue right now.
Joe
[turns to Frank] Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.
Frank
My clue is kind of pointing this way.
Joe
[moves to his left, to where Frank's clue is pointing] Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue.
Frank
I've still got a raging clue.
Joe
[turns right] My clue's pointing over there now!
Frank
Oh, let's follow that clue! [move off to the right and away from the boys' room.]
The school bell rings and the kids pour out into the hall
Stan
Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
Kyle
Not yet.
Cartman
They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
Kyle
Will you shut up about 9/11!
Cartman
Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
Kyle
Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
Cartman
Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
Kyle
Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
Stan
Yeah, at least one-fourth.
Kyle
Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
Cartman
...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! [sees Butters walking towards the group]
Butters
Hey, fellas!
Cartman
Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
Butters
Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
Cartman
Aha! Do you see?
Kyle
Where did you hear that?
Butters
[points] From Eric.
Cartman
I rest my case.
Kyle
[walks up and stands next to Butters] Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
Butters
Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
Cartman
That's right, Butters.
Kyle
Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
Cartman
What? People see the truth?
Butters
Can I go now?
Cartman
You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media! [begins to move away from the boys] I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! [goes around a corner and disappears]
Kyle
[rolls his eyes] Oh no...
Montage. Cartman exits the school as the camera is in a position to watch him pass under the U.S. Flag. Next, he scours the Web for information on 9/11. He looks at the sites with a critical eye. Next, he goes to the library to find more in-depth information. Among the books Cartman is reading are "Security Tyrrany" and "How the Towers Fell." He goes up on a hill and sees the whole town laid out before him. He returns to the boys' room and analyzes the urinal. He makes himself some tea and watches a video on his computer that stops right before the second plane hits and presents a big red question mark. He's making notes on something while sitting in the armchair... it turns out to be a picture of the urinal with the deuce still in it.
Cartman
It is wrong for me to ask questions?
Is it wrong to seek the truth?
I just can't blindly accept their version.
I can't base my logic on proof.
Almost all the evidence points one way,
But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:
I need to know what really happened
On 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.
What really happened
On 9/11?[He's back at his computer once more and clicks on his mouse]Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?
Next day, Mrs. Garrison's class is again in session. It's Show and Tell day. Leroy walks up to the front of the class and presents his topic.
Leroy
This is my frog. He doesn't have a name. He's a frog not a toad because toads don't ribbit. I think frogs are good pets. [he gets a smattering of applause from the other kids, then goes back to his seat]
Mrs. Garrison
Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell?
Cartman
[raises and waves his hand] Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!
Mrs. Garrison
All right, Eric, you can go next.
Cartman
[leaves his seat and goes to the front of the class with his laptop.] For Show and Tell today I have brought... [puts on some glasses] ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!.. [removes the glasses for dramatic effect] behind the 9/11 attacks! [the lights go out and a projector is turned on]
Kyle
[rolls his eyes] Oh Christ...
Cartman
[his first image is that of the Twin Towers] We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers, [the image gets animated as a cross-section of a wall is picked apart and the steel girders shown, which led to their collapse.] which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel? [the other kids look at each other. Kyle's eyes are half-closed, showing his disinterest] We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well, [a picture of the Pentagon with the damage clearly visible. A helicopter hovers nearby] but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?
Clyde
Whoa...
Cartman
So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? [he begins to use his fingers to show the numbers as he says them] Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. [click. Kyle now appears superimposed on the 9/11 picture already onscreen]. Kyle!
Kyle
Me??!
Cartman
Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! [clicks, and another shot of the Twin Towers is shown] When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, [he zooms in on the picture, which just becomes pixilated] but when I computer-enhanced it, [the pixilation disappears as the picture sharpens - it's a drawing of an evil Kyle with a large, sharp knife in his right hand] You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
The bell rings again and the kids once again enter the hall. The camera looks towards the front doors. Kyle walks toward the camera and scratches his nose.
Kyle
Hey Token. [Token does not respond, but just watches him walk by. Kyle stops by Butters and Craig] You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? [Butters is suddenly scared]
Butters
Waaaah! [drops his book and runs away. The other kids just stare at Kyle]
Kyle
All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11! [the other kids move away quickly] God-damnit!
Kyle's house, after school. Kyle walks in through the front door, upset. He slams the door shut behind him. Sheila is cleaning the coffee table in front of the couch
Sheila
Hello bubbe, how was school today?
Kyle
[stops in front of Sheila, to her left] Terrible.
Sheila
Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.
Kyle
But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat?!
A PTA meeting, later
Sheila
We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
Principal Victoria
Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.
Skeeter
Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth.
Other men
Oh no, oh brother, oh God.
Mr. Adler
[stands up] That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?
Other men
Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded.
Mr. Mackey
[stands up] Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that!
Sheila
Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!
Mr. Mackey
More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!
Jimbo
He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!
Mr. Mackey
No, I'm not saying they're related!
Randy
[rises] How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! [makes a fist]
Skeeter
It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!
Richard
Who else could it have been?
Det. Yates
This is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
Mr. Mackey
Oh no, not the Goddamned-
A montage of the Hardly Boys follows. The same music and montage as before are played
Narrator
The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in: [the cover of a new book is shown] The Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy.
Police headquarters. Det. Yates has a post-9/11 picture with a circled question mark where the towers used to be.
Det. Yates
So that's about the long and short of it, Hardly Boys. There were two towers that stood right here, [shows off the question mark] and they're gone.
Frank
And nobody knows who's responsible?
Det. Yates
There are theories, but, nobody's certain.
Joe
Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?
Frank
Ooo... oh, I just started getting a clue.
Joe
Really?
Frank
Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue.
Joe
Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now.
Frank
Mine's pointing to the left.
Joe
Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.
Frank
Okay, let's follow your raging clue.
Joe
Oofff.
Randy
[watches them walk away] Godspeed.
Kyle's house, night. The front door opens and Kyle looks out. A couple of agents look back at him from their car parked out in front of the house. One looks both ways to make sure no one is coming while the other looks at his watch. Kyle move away from the entrance and closes the door softly
Stan
[appears suddenly in the living room] Kyle!
Kyle
[jumps] Aaaah!
Stan
Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys [looks around] are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
Kyle
I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
Stan
Well why did you have to involve me??
Kyle
It's not my fault.
Stan
All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
Kyle
Really?
Stan
Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you. [moves off, then stops and turns around] There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
Kyle
......Dude.
Stan
[mulls it over] That's all I needed. [turns around and heads for the back door. Kyle follows.]
South Park Elementary, next day. The bell rings and the students are all in the gym. Mr. Mackey addresses them
Mr. Mackey
Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela [walks up to a school janitor, who's a Latino with mop and bucket in hand], the school janitor. Okay? [the fourth graders are shown with some kindergartners in front of them] He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face! [the sixth graders are shown seated to the left of the fourth graders] So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head! [the kids laugh] Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!
Mrs. Garrison
Mr. Mackey! [he and Principal Victoria enter the gym] We got him.
Mr. Mackey
Huh?
Mrs. Garrison
We caught the person that did it.
Somewhere... A taxi drops Stan and Kyle off in front of a large house. They walk up to the front door and Stan knocks.
Stan
Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
Man
[wearing a 911truth.org T-shirt] Aw geez. Come on in, kids. [the boys enter. A model of the towers stands on the coffee table while the computer displays a 9/11 Web page. The rest of the office is littered with 9/11 stuff] It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day.
Kyle
They are?
911truth Man
Yeah, it a way of keeping people from seeing the real evidence. I know it seems crazy, but 9/11 was pulled off by our own government, so they could gain support for attacking the Middle East.
Kyle
What? No no no.
911truth Man
I know it's hard to believe.
Stan
Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
911truth Man
It's called the False Flag policy. Make it look like the enemy attacked you. Get all your citizens riled up and waving American flags. Then you're free to invade any country you want.
Kyle
...That's retarded.
911truth Man
[sits at his computer and starts typing away] Look into the evidence of 9/11 and you'll see there are a lot of holes in their story.
Kyle
There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
911truth Man
You don't understand! The government controls everything. The media, the corporations, they have the power to do anything they want. Here, look! [grabs two large glass jars and hands them to Kyle] Read the labels on these! Go on, read them!
Kyle
[reads the labels] Code 234
911truth Man
We think they came from a government office.
Kyle
What is it?
911truth Man
It's anthrax.
Kyle
Anthrax?!
911truth Man
Someday we'll use it as evidence against them.
Kyle
Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob! [at that moment the house is raided by Chicago cops. The doors and windows fall away as they rush inside. An ambulance and a lot of police cars wait outside as a helicopter hovers overhead. Kyle stands with the jars of anthrax, sure that he's in big trouble] Aw, aw, awww!
Mr. Mackey's office, day. He's addressing the guilty party...
Mr. Mackey
Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?
Clyde
I don't know. [looks away as Mr. Mackey gets up, walks around the desk, and stands behind him, to his left]
Mr. Mackey
You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room. [walks behind Clyde to the right side. Clyde looks away and to the left] Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at! [Clyde tries hard to contain his laughter] Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll! [Clyde grins, then bursts out laughing. The door opens and Principal Victoria looks in]
Principal Victoria
Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, that's good! [Principal Victoria walks away. Mr. Mackey addresses Clyde again] Let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade! [The Donovans show up] Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal!
Mr. Donovan
Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know...
The White House, day. Stan, Kyle, and the man from 911truth.org are brought into the Oval Office by the Secret Service. The President's staff awaits.
Kyle
Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.
Donald Rumsfeld
Come on in, Mr. President. [President Bush comes in through one of the side doors]
Kyle
Uh, Mr. President, my name is-
Bush
SSHHUUDDUUPP!! You think we don't know your name?! We know everything! We control everything! [walks to his desk] We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret! But you just had to keep digging!
Kyle
[quite surprised] Really?
911truth Man
You won't get away with it! People know!
Bush
People? You mean sheeple. We have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance. Just one more... leak... [pulls out a pistol and his voice gets sinister] to fix... [the Secret Service agents take the 911truth man to the President]
911truth Man
Wait. What are you doing?
Bush
[leaves his desk and cocks the gun] You've been a thorn in our side for too long, I'm afraid.
911truth Man
No! You can't do this! [Bush grabs him by the collar] Please! I'll stop. I'll take down the Web site. I'll sto- [the President sticks the gun into the man's mouth] Oh no! Oh no!
Bush
Too late. [squeezes the trigger once and the bullet goes clear through the man's head. The 911truth man is dead]
Stan
JESUS CHRIST!!
Rumsfeld
[Condoleezza Rice stands to his left] Hahaha. He died like a pig.
Bush
[wipes the blood off his clothes and skin] Some pigs never learn.
Kyle
[in sheer disbelief, cocks his head right] No. Way.
Stan
He was right. You DID cause 9/11.
Bush
Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever.
Kyle
[ever more incredulous, cocks his head left and lower] ...Really??
Stan
Why?!
Bush
[smiling, he begins to pace] Oldest reason in the world. Money. The towers fell and the American sheeple all waved their flags. [walks by Dick Cheney, who's got a crossbow and is dressed to hunt] Finally we could invade Iraq, [finishes off with sinister glee] and get the oil which made us all richer than before.
Rumsfeld
[rubs his hands together greedily] Beauutiful money, hahahaha!
Kyle
[cocks his head right and even lower. He's not buying it] ...Really??
Stan
[off on a different page] Is the whole government in on this?
Bush
We are all-knowing and all-powerful. Good-bye, boys. [steps aside as Dick Cheney takes aim at them. Cheney fires an arrow at them, but the arrow hits a marble vase on a table behind the boys. The arrow bounces off the vase and hits fire alarm, which sets off the sprinkler system. Everyone does his best not to get wet]
Cheney
Dangit! I missed again!
Bush
For Christ's sake, Cheney! [Two aids open the doors to the Oval Office and enter]
Stan
[seeing their chance] Kyle! Run! [the boys take off with the Secret Service in hot pursuit]
Bush
KILL THEM!
Attendance office, day, next to the Principal's office. Mr. Mackey stands there with Principal Victoria in the background, at her desk. He picks up the PA mic.
Mr. Mackey
Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay? [all the kids in the hall listen, then start laughing] Oh you think that's funny, huh?! [Principal Victoria is also snickering in the background] Let me assure you, there is nothing funny... about going up to a nice, clean, unsuspectin' urinal, [next shot is the school gym, where some students are practicing their basketball skills, but now they're listening] 'kay, droppin' your pants then... turnin' around... squattin' over that urinal, 'kay, maybe... maybe pullin' your buttcheeks apart with your hands, m'kay, and then layin' out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see. [the kids there begin to laugh] Oh yeah, that's real funny! [turns off the mic and slams it down] I'm gonna catch this sonofabitch if it's the last thing I DO! M'kay?! [moves off]
A bus terminal. A bus pulls in from Washington D.C. and the door opens. Passengers pour out, including Stan and Kyle.
Stan
All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude. [next scene is another city, somewhere] We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
Kyle
It just... doesn't seem right.
Stan
Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
Kyle
Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. [a door opens besides them and the 911truth man the President had shot exits a restaurant and goes the other direction]
Stan
Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? [Kyle stops and turns around]
Kyle
Hey! [the 911truth man turns around, then panics as he recognizes the boys] Dude. You're alive? [the man stands there for a few seconds, not knowing what to do, then turns around and runs away, pushing people aside. Kyle gives chase] Come back here! [the man keeps running]
Man 1
Hey!
Man 2
Ogh!
the POV changes to that of a dead-end alley. The camera descends from on high as the 911truth man runs down the alley. It stops descending when Stan and Kyle round the corner. The man reaches a chain-link fence and tries to climb it. The boys come in closer. The man fails to climb the fence and drops to the ground when the boys reach him.
911truth Man
[begins to plead] No. Please. Pleeease!
Kyle
Dude! What the hell is going on?!
911truth Man
Don't kill me! I, I just do what they say!
Stan
What who said?
911truth Man
I have a family. Please don't kill me!
Kyle
Dude, we aren't going to kill you. [just then a gunshot is heard and the 911truth man falls dead... again]
Stan
Oh God!
Bearded Man
[appears with the smoking gun] It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me!
Kyle
Who the fuck are you?!
Bearded Man
There's no time! come on! [the camera pans up but stays focused on the three folks as the boys follow the bearded man out of the alley.]
A mansion, night. The bearded man escorts Stan and Kyle in and leads them to his library
Kyle
Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
Stan
Who are you?
Bearded Man
[pours himself a drink] I'm a detective, and I'm afraid that you kids have been double-crossed.
Kyle
You f-figured this thing all out?
Bearded Man
Not me. My mystery-solving sons. Come on in, boys. [the Hardly Boys enter] My boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd, which gave them a clue.
Frank
Gave us both a clue.
Mr. Hardly
That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues.
Joe
I was getting a clue like every two minutes.
Frank
I got such a raging clue that I almost shot clue goo all over Joe.
Mr. Hardly
Those clues pointed out that all the 9/11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.
Frank
It was huuuge.
Mr. Hardly
That all the 9/11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9/11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy.
Stan
Aw Jesus...
Kyle
Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
Mr. Hardly
For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?
Bush
[off-screen] That's quite enough, Hardly! [the camera shows him entering with his staff] Don't believe what he says, boys; we caused 9/11. [brings forth a manila folder] It's all right here in these secret documents, [hugs the folder tight] but you'll never get them. [turns around as he yawns, dropping the folder to the floor behind him. No one picks it up]
Kyle
I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
Bush
[dropping the act] Boys, you don't understand. People need to think we are all-powerful. That we control the world. If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11 then... we appear to control nothing.
Kyle
Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
Bush
We do that too. And most people believe the truth. But one fourth of the population is retarded. If they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans, why not let them?
Mr. Hardly
Just one thing, Mr. President: How the devil did you know we were all here? [a close-up of Kyle. A gun appears next to his left temple. The camera moves clockwise as it refocuses on Stan, who's got the gun aimed at Kyle. Stan must have told the President]
Stan
How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
Kyle
Stan! What the fuck?!
Stan
It was all planned out!
Kyle
You knew this whole time? Why?
Stan
Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
Kyle
[backs away a bit] What??
Stan
The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
Kyle
So you blamed the government?!
Mr. Hardly
And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9/11!
Stan
[lowers his pistol] Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
Kyle
So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
Stan
Yuh.
Kyle
So then, who was responsible for 9/11?
Stan
Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
Frank
[giggles] Yeah. What are you, retarded? [The President and his staff laugh heartily]
Mr. Hardly
Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!
The boys' room at South Park Elementary, day. Stan is cleaning the urinal under Mr. Mackey's supervision
Mr. Mackey
When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay! [Stan squirts some cleaning fluid onto the urinal basin] How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face? [Stan laughs] Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!
End of Mystery of the Urinal Deuce

Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy
South Park Elementary, day, school hall. The bell rings and the students go to their lockers. Stan and Kyle put some books away as Cartman shares an encounter with Kenny and the other two.
Cartman
And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, "Do you smell lemon grass?", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
A Hall Monitor
[a ginger, he taps on Cartman's right shoulder] Eric, I have to take you to the principal's office.
Cartman
What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
Hall Monitor
I've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office.
Cartman
Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
Hall Monitor
I'm just doin' my job.
Cartman
[taunting and jabbing at him] I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
Principal Victoria
Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.
Cartman
Aw Goddamnit!
The principal's office, moments later. A knock is heard at the door.
Principal Victoria
Come on in, Eric. [Cartman and the hall monitor enter]
Cartman
[apologizes, but in a blasé fashion] I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?
Principal Victoria
Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. [the former hall monitor removes his belt and sash and prepares to give them to Cartman]
Cartman
The hall monit- me?
Mr. Mackey
You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay? [Cartman receives the sash and the former hall monitor leaves]
Principal Victoria
If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.
Cartman
[incredulous] Auth- authoritah?
Mr. Mackey
Now Eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. M'kay? It is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power.
Cartman
Ahem. Me?
A montage. First scene is the school hall. Cartman pops up dressed as Dog the Bounty Hunter. He walks around and strikes a few poses. He pockets a can of Bear Spray into its holster, makes sure he has handcuffs, then resets his fake facial hair. Next, he pretends he's driving a real car. Back at school, he walks into view and strikes one more dramatic pose, then the POV changes and he's walking towards the camera. One more scene has him turning the steering wheel of an SUV.
Cartman
There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!
[laughs until a hand appears and knocks on the driver's window.]

Car Salesman
[opens the door] Hey, kid, get outta there.
Cartman
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [leaves. The video shoot resumes at school. Cartman is on the job when he turns around and sees someone else in the hall. He strikes a dramatic pose and yells] Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
Boy
What?
Cartman
[shoves the boy into the lockers and whips out the Bear Spray] You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!
Boy
It's right here. [reaches into his pocket and pulls it out to show him]
Cartman
[releases the boy] All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. [turns right and walks away. The boy isn't quite finished]
Boy
What? You can't just push me up against the-
Cartman
[kicks the boy away] Argh!
Boy
[flies out of view]Aah!
Cartman
[marches on] I am the Dawg, the big bad- [stops] Oh my God! [sees a wad of paper on the floor, runs up to pick it up and checks it out] What the fuck is this?!
Kindergarten. The kindergartners' new teacher is shown teaching them about shapes. She's drawn a circle and is now drawing a square
Teacher
And so this shape with four sides is what, class?
Cartman
[bursts into the classroom] Boyarrrgh! [everyone turns to see who it is. Cartman walks up to Ike] Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
Teacher
What are you doing?!
Cartman
I found this in the hallway. [unfolds the wad of paper - it's a drawing Ike made of his teacher with hearts all around her] Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you. [Ike looks around nervously] You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. [hands the drawing to the teacher and heads for the door]
Teacher
I don't think that's really necessary.
Cartman
Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! [leaves and closes the door]
Fillmore
Ike has a crush on teacher!
Class
Ike has a crush on teacher! [the class laughs]
Teacher
That's enough, class! [the period ends and the teacher begins erasing the chalkboard] Okay, well see you tomorrow, everybody. Ike, could you stay just a few minutes, please? [Fillmore takes his crayon and leaves. The teacher moves towards Ike] Ike, I'm very flattered, by all of your love notes, but I need to be clear. See, there've been a lot of female teachers on the news lately who have been having relationships with young male students and, people might get the wrong idea, even though... I do admire you. You are so smart and gifted. Soo mature for your age.
Ike
I don't like Mason.
Teacher
You listen, and you really care about what I have to say. You make me feel things I've never... [reaches out to Ike and touches his right hand] felt before. [she and Ike hold hands, but she lets go and leaves her seat] Ike, this is crazy. I'm your teacher. How can we be having these feelings for each other? [turns around and faces him] You're so mysterious, and I can't... and I can't... [begins to swoon. A montage follows]
She and Ike rub noses as a heart frames them. Their shadows rush up and hug each other, then twirl around together as hearts pulsate outward. They hold hands again. She takes him out to dinner and chatters away. She takes him out to ice-skate at a skating rink. She takes him out to a dinner picnic before a setting sun - they share wine and cheese. She takes him out for a ride on a duck boat - she does the driving. She has an artist draw a picture of them. They hop onto a merry-go-round and get on horses - she blows a kiss at him there. She takes him home and watches TV with him
REO Speedwagon
And I can't fight this feelin' anymore
I've forgotten what I started fightin' for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashin' through your door
Baby, I cant fight this feelin' anymore
[the last scene is the two of them under the covers ]

Teacher
That was unbelievable. I've never felt like such a woman before. They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't let anybody know; they'll never understand. [rolls to her right and starts massaging Ike tenderly] We were meant to be, I know it. How else could sex be that incredible? [lays back down]
Ike
[oops] Ike made a nuno.
The boy's room at South Park Elementary. Butters rushes in and towards the urinal. Once in place, he sets his hall pass aside, drops his pants, raises his shirt, and lets fly
Butters
Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle? [falsetto] Yes I do think so.
Cartman
[bursts into the restroom. Butters is startled] Hands?! Let me see those hands!
Butters
[backs off] Haaaah!
Cartman
[advances] Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
Butters
[looks around frantically for it] It's, it's... I just had it! [keeps looking, but Cartman grabs him...]
Cartman
I knew it! [...slams his head against a toilet stall, then tosses him to the floor, cuffs him, and escorts him out of the restroom. Butters doesn't get a chance to pull his pants up. The hall pass remains on the sink where Butters left it.]
The waiting room outside the principal office, moments later. Cartman and Butters wait on the bench outside, and Butters still has his pants around his ankles
Cartman
Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
Butters
Huh?
Cartman
Here, you need a smoke, brah?
Butters
Uhh, okay. [Cartman puts a cigarette into Butters' mouth, then lights it for him]
Cartman
You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
Butters
I do. [coughs]
Cartman
Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. [Butters coughs some more]
The Broflovski house, afternoon. Kyle walks in.
Sheila
[greets him holding some laundry] Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.
Kyle
Huh?
Sheila
Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.
Kyle
What's he doing at his teacher's house?
Sheila
He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
The teacher's house, a lovely one-story structure. Starland Vocal Band's "Afternoon Delight" is playing inside. Kyle walks up to the front door and knocks.
Kyle
Hello? [finds the door open and walks in] Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike? [moves further into the house] Uh, hello? Is Ike here? [enters the room the music and some giggling is coming from - it's the bathroom] Hello? [the teacher, in the bathtub, looks at him]
Teacher
OOOH! [covers her breasts]
Kyle
Oh God! [squeezes his eyes shut] I'm sorry. [opens them again] I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother. [Ike pops up out of the water dressed in snorkel gear. Kyle's eyebrows go up] Ike?? [they just look at him] What the hell is going on??
Teacher
Oh, what's the use, Ike? We're caught. [moments later, an angry Kyle is pulling Ike towards the front door] Hold on, please, you don't understand.
Kyle
[turns to look at her] Really?! What's there not to understand?!
Teacher
Your brother and I... are in love.
Kyle
He's a little young, don't you think?!
Ike
Oh. [angrily, he leaves Kyle for his teacher]
Teacher
Ike is very mature for his age, and you know it!
Ike
Ring around the rosey.
Teacher
He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle-
Kyle
All right! We're getting the hell out of here! [begins to pull Ike away from the teacher]
Ike
[resisting] Nonono, nononono.
Kyle
Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
Ike
[sobbing] No, no.
Kyle
Ike?
Teacher
Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?
Kyle
[turns to the front door] This is nuts.
The Broflovski house, dinnertime.
Kyle
Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? [Ike glares at Kyle]
Sheila
Miss Stevenson? Yes. She's very nice.
Kyle
Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
Sheila
That's great.
Kyle
Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
Ike
Spider-Man! I'm safe, Mom.
Sheila
Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you?
Kyle
Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
Ike
Weohhh part ten. Mom-my I love you I love you.
Sheila
Mommy loves you too, sweetie.
Kyle
Would you excuse us for a second? [leaves his chair and takes Ike to the living room. Kyle now addresses Ike] You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike! [Ike replies with a series of snippets from nursery rhymes, which has nothing to do with Kyle's concern. Kyle is finished, and the two of them return to the table] Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!
Sheila
Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. [silence follows as the family continues eating]
Park County Police Station, day. Seems like Officer Barbrady and his police station have been phased out for good now. Detective Yates and his men are in the breakroom eating lunch
Det. Yates
You're so full of crap, Foley.
Foley
What? I did shoot him in the face. Twice.
Kyle
[appears at the breakroom entrance] Ex, excuse me? [the officers look, and he walks in] My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.
Yates
Oh? What's the crime?
Kyle
Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
Yates
Oh my God! This is terrible! [other officers say other things. Yates and another officer get on bended knee next to Kyle] Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?
Kyle
Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
Officer 1
A woman.
Kyle
Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. [the officer to his right is taking notes.]
Officer 2
Oh, but, but she's ugly, right?
Kyle
Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
Yates
The blonde?
Kyle
Yeah.
Officer 1
Some young boy is having sex with Miss Stevenson?
Kyle
[firmly] Yes.
Officer 1
Nisssse.
Yates
Nnice.
Kyle
What?! No, you don't understand-
Officer 1
You sure they've had sex?
Kyle
Yeah.
Officer 3
Has she performed oral sex on him?
Kyle
I think so.
Officer 3
...Nice.
Officer 1
Nisssse.
Officer 3
[whispers] Nisssse.
Yates
So wait, what, what's the crime?
Officer 1
The crime is, she isn't doing it with me. [jabs jokingly at Officer 2. All the officers laugh]
Kyle
Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
Yates
You're right. We're sorry. This is serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his "Luckiest Boy In America" medal right away. [All the officers laugh harder]
Kyle
[throws his hands up in frustration and leaves] Gargh!
South Park Elementary, day, hallway. The students at either at their lockers or milling around. Kyle approaches Stan and Kenny.
Kyle
Guys, can I talk to you?
Stan
Sure dude.
Kyle
I need you to keep quiet about this, all right? [Cartman walks up] My little brother and his tea-
Cartman
Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
Kyle
Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
Stan
Dude, what's the matter?
Kyle
The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
Stan
...Wow.
Kenny
(Reaaly??)
Cartman
Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
Kyle
It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
Cartman
What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
Kyle
[looks long and hard at Cartman] "stick it inside her and pee"
Cartman
Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
Stan
Dude, I really don't see a problem.
Cartman
Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
Kyle
You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break, [Cartman waves Kyle off and walks away] and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! [this stops Cartman and makes his eyes big]
Cartman
They what??
Kyle
They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
Cartman
[spins around] Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
Kyle
Well they're doing it!
Cartman
Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
Kindergarten class, in session
Miss Stevenson
Okay, just continue with your macaroni pictures. Teacher has to step out for a second. Uh Ike, could you help me out, please? [Ike leaves his seat and joins Miss Stevenson outside. She puts him on the shelf of the telephone booth next to the classroom] Oh Ike, I just had to have a second alone with you.
Ike
I like dada better.
Miss Stevenson
I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class. [she begins to kiss Ike. Cartman appears in the distance and turns right...]
Cartman
Hall infraction! [runs up to Miss Stevenson]
Miss Stevenson
[turning to Cartman] Oh uhh, we were just heading back in.
Cartman
You got a hall pass, brah?!
Miss Stevenson
I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.
Cartman
Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!
Miss Stevenson
Look, just let us get back in-
Cartman
Get down on the floor!
Miss Stevenson
We're going back inside!
Cartman
[whips out the Bear Spray] You like bear mace, icehead?!
Miss Stevenson
Bear mace??
Cartman
You're goin' with Christ! [sprays Miss Stevenson pretty good]
Miss Stevenson
Oooooh!
Next stop, the principal's office. Cartman, Miss Stevenson and Ike stand before Principal Victoria
Cartman
...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
Principal Victoria
"Ike, I long to feel your arms around me"?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?
Cartman
Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
Principal Victoria
This is unbelievable.
Cartman
I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
Principal Victoria
Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police.
Miss Stevenson
[puts her hands to her cheeks] Oh God...
Cartman
You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!
South Park Elementary, later. The front doors are open, revealing the school logo and the steps leading up to the hallways. Police and news reporters are present. Two officers exit with Miss Stevenson in handcuffs.
Yates
[sarcastically] Sorry we had to do this, but the lady principal insisted. [the officers move past Yates]
Randy
[shows up next to Jimbo and Ned] What's goin' on?
Jimbo
The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
Randy
With a student? But... she's a woman.
Jimbo
Yeah. I know.
Randy
But... she's hot.
Kyle
Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
Cartman
You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. [points his index fingers at the camera]
The Broflovski house, night, Kyle's room. Kyle is writing something out when Ike appears at his doorway, pissed off that his teacher was taken away
Kyle
[sensing Ike, turns around in his chair] Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor. [Ike glares at him] Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.
Ike
You are dead to me!
Kyle
What?
Ike
I said, you're dead to me!
Kyle
I'm dead to you?
Ike
[points at him] You're dead to me, Kyle!
Park County Police Station, day. Miss Stevenson is calling someone from there as officers stand around and discuss police items
Miss Stevenson
I'm at the police station. They say they found some evidence. I'm so scared. [Ike is at the other end of the line] Listen, I want you to know it's okay. If anybody tries to talk to you, you don't need to say anything. Just leave it to me. I know a way out of this.
News 4 Newsbreak: A reporter in front of the South Park Courthouse
Reporter
Tom, an elementary school teacher is under arrest for allegedly having an affair... with one of her young students. The case is shocking, due mostly to the fact that the teacher... is pretty hot, Tom. If the accusations are true, then... damn! Uh, looks like the defendant and her lawyer are about to give a statement, Tom.
Miss Stevenson
I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students.
Man 1
Nice.
Man 2
[whispers and squeezes his eyes shut] Nissse
Miss Stevenson
I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic.
Officer 4
Ohhhh.
Kyle's hosue, day. Cartman and Kyle are watching the special report nn TV
Miss Stevenson
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
Cartman
Oh no!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
Back at the Courthouse
Miss Stevenson
I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do.
Yates
Well, that explains it.
Officer 1
Do we still press charges?
Yates
Who are we gonna convict? Johnny Walker?
Man 3
Poor woman. She's a victim.
Randy
Yeah, she's a hot victim. [looks around for any reaction, but none comes]
Lawyer
[steps up to the mic] My client has agreed to check herself into rehab immediately. [everyone cheers her on]
Print Reporter
Good luck, ma'am. You can beat your alcoholism. [more cheering]
Park County Drug & Alcohol Rehabilitation Center. Patients line up and go in through a revolving door only to come back out and continue down the line.
The office of a rehab counselor. Miss Stevenson is seated before the counselor.
Therapist
Alcohol is a crutch which we use to medicate ourselves; to, to cover up emotional baggage from our past. Was there ever a history of sexual abuse in your family?
Miss Stevenson
No, but my uncle used to ask me and my twin sister to kiss and he'd take pictures.
Therapist
Nissse. [sometime later, they're outside the center. He sees her off] Congratulations, Miss Stevenson.
Miss Stevenson
All better now. [walks away, gets into her truck and drives away. She drives up to the Broflovski house, stops, gets out a ladder and extends it, props it up against Ike's window, and climbs up]
Ike's room. Ike is building something with Legos. Miss Stevenson appears at the window and opens it up
Miss Stevenson
Ike. [climbs in and walks to Ike. He turns and stands, his arms outstretched]
Ike
Miss Stephenson [she kneels down, picks him up and holds him close]
Miss Stevenson
Ike, we have to get out of here! They'll never let us be together. I think... I think we should go to Milan, like we always talked about. [puts both her hands to her heart]
Ike
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay, Mulan!
Miss Stevenson
Get your things together. We don't have much time.
Kyle's room. He's at his desk copying text from from a book. He hears the sound of something landing on the ground outside, then of a car door closing. He gets up to investigate. He goes to Ike's room and opens the door, then looks around.
Kyle
Ike, are you okay? [sees an emptier room than usual, and the open window.] Ike? [walks up to the window and sees the ladder still in place.] Iiiike! [the teacher and Ike away.]
Park County Police Station, breakroom day. The officers are now eating pizza.
Yates
Are you sure you're not lying, Foley?
Foley
No, really! I shot both of them! They weren't even doin' nothin'!
Sheila
[enters the breakroom with Kyle following close behind] Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!
Yates
You're kidding!
Sheila
No, it's true!
Yates
Damnit, where were all these sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!
Sheila
This is serious!
Officer 3
Yeah, boys going to Milan with a beautiful older woman. Quick! Call the FBI! [the officers laugh. Detective Yates smiles]
Sheila
Are you going to do nothing?!
Yates
[irritated] All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus...
The Broflovski house, day. Kyle sits at the edge of the patio, depressed. Cartman walks up to him
Cartman
There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
Kyle
Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
Cartman
No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
Kyle
How do you know that?
Cartman
I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
Kyle
Who's Beth?
Cartman
Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
Music video. In this one, Cartman introduces his crew. One of them is "Kyle, Jew."
Cartman

I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!

Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again! [the video ends and the hallway looks normal again] How was that, Butters?

Butters
[behind the camera] Ehthat was pretty good.
Kyle
Can we get going now, please?!
Cartman
Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! [they go forth]
An airport Hilton, night. Planes can be seen behind it taking off.
A room at the Hilton. Ike is in bed watching TV. Miss Stevenson comes out of the bathroom.
Miss Stevenson
Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?
Ike
I love TV. Yaaay!
Miss Stevenson
[climbs into bed] But what about me? I want to talk. [Ike just goes back to watching the TV]
A car, night. Cartman and his crew are driving to the airport
Cartman
Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
Leeroy
[in a retarded voice] She ran away; now she got to deal with the Dawg, huh?
Cartman
[determined] Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel! [into the Intercom] Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here! [Beth just signals for Earl to drive into the hotel driveway and stop at the front doors. Earl pulls up and brakes quickly] All right, let's go! Move out! [they leave the SUV and rush into the hotel]
Bellboy
Hey! You can't leave your car there!
Cartman
It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor! [they pass through the front entrance] Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!
Receptionist
Can I help you?
Cartman
You seen this woman, brah? [shows her a picture of Miss Stevenson] She's staying here!
Receptionist
Who are you?
Cartman
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Head Concierge
I think you should leave before I call the police!
Cartman
Beth! Bear-mace that guy! [she sprays bear mace all over the concierge and he crumbles to the floor, trying to vomit] Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!
Bellboy
[dials 911] We need police here, right away! [Cartman begins his rounds. He goes to Room 236 and knocks on the door with the bear mace can]
Guest 1
[a man, opens the door] Yes?
Cartman
I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
Guest 2
[an elderly man in Room 233] Do you mind keepin' it down?
Cartman
[walks over to the second guest] Keep your mouth shut, brah!!
Ike and the teacher's room. Both of them react to something. In the distance, police sirens sound and get closer to the hotel. Miss Stevenson looks out the window and sees three police cruisers pull up to the hotel, right outside her window
Miss Stevenson
Oh no! Ike! [Ike climbs up to see the commotion] They're on to us!
Ike
Oh no!
Miss Stevenson
Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!
The hotel lobby. The police rush in
Officers
What have we got? What have we got?!
Officer 5
Who called 911?!
Receptionist
They went that way. [points in the direction Kyle and Leeroy took. The concierge barfs continuously. The officers leave] Look out! They have bear mace!
The hotel, upstairs. Kyle and Leeroy make the rounds on the third floor.
Leeroy
[pounds at the door at Room 323] Open up! I'm with the Dawg! [pounds some more]
Kyle
Oh crap! [some officers round the corner at the far end of the hall]
Officer 6
[draws his gun] You freeze right there! [Kyle and Leeroy run in the other direction]
The fifth floor. Miss Stevenson covers up and peeks into the hallway. She looks both ways, then steps out of the room
Miss Stevenson
Come on, darling! [Ike steps out and they beginning walking. Earl rounds the corner behind them and catches them]
Earl
Hey! [they stop and the camera zooms in on Earl.] Uh I got 'em, Dawg. Fifth floor!
Cartman
Praise Christ! Let's go! [the elderly man is convulsing from the effects of the bear mace.]
Miss Stevenson
Ike, run! [back on the second floor, Cartman and Beth run down a hallway]
Cartman
Bear mace that guy! And that guy! [Beth maces another bellboy and a guest as she and Cartman run by. Police officers round the corner and run after them]
The roof. Miss Stevenson and Ike have made it all the way to the top. Cartman, Beth and Earl show up behind them and run out onto the roof. Police officers show up behind them and run out onto the roof
Cartman
Freeze, bitch!
Officer 7
Freeze!
Officer 8
Hands up! Hands up!
Officer 9
Don't move! Don't move!
Cartman
It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor. [the officers are somewhat stunned] This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
Officer 10
Hey, that is the teacher we just got the report about. [she and Ike back up slowly, towards the roof's edge. Kyle and Leeroy show up]
Officer 7
[through his bullhorn] All right, Miss Stevenson, you got nowhere to go!
Miss Stevenson
Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.
Cartman
Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
Leeroy
She gawt a scarf awn her heyed, huh?
Miss Stevenson
It's all over, Ike. Milan, the house in Tuscany. They'll never let us be together! We have to go with the backup plan. [she and Ike walk to the roof's edge and look down at the ground]
Officer 7
[through his bullhorn] Now hold on, don't do anything foolish! We can talk about this!
Miss Stevenson
[returns from the edge with Ike] You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity.
Kyle
[steps through Cartman and Beth towards Ike] No! Ike, don't do it!
Ike
I don deser futty bad man.
Kyle
Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. [Ike looks at Kyle intently]
Miss Stevenson
You who don't believe in true love don't understand.
Kyle
Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. [Ike thinks it over]
Miss Stevenson
I'm afraid you're too late. [to Ike] Are you ready, my love? [she and Ike turn around and run for the edge] Here we go! One, two, three, aaaahhh! [she jumps over the edge, Ike turns back and walks towards Kyle. She looks up at the roof's edge] Ike?? [she lands on her back and dies on impact]
Ike
Yaaaay!
Kyle
Ike!
Cartman
[moves towards the camera] Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
Officer 8
Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now.
Cartman
That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [walks towards the camera to turn it off.]
End of Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy

Hell on Earth 2006
Hell, outside Satan's castle.
Hell, inside the castle. Satan is seated on his throne with two lava fountains behind him, one on either side. Before each fountain is a pile of bleached skulls. Before the throne is a semicircular table with six elder demons sitting behind it. Nine steps lead up to the throne
Satan
[slow and deliberate] Halloween is a night for evil. It is time for me to take what is mine.
Demon 1
[the pale one] What do you plan, Lord Satan?
Satan
On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities!
Demon 2
[second from right] How big a party are we talking?
Satan
Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties? That big.
Demon 2
Satan, we can't possibly do-
Satan
SILENCE! [descends from his thrown to the floor] Halloween is about me! And I deserve a par-ty! This... shall be MY Super Sweet 16!! [raises his arms up in victory and laughs heartily. A few blasts of steam pop out of volcanoes and the citizens of Hell are frightened. Satan's image appears in the smoke] Minions of Hell! The time has come for us to rise! For my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!! [the minions look at each other] I got Bacardi, and Ghetto One to sponsor the party, and I'm calling it [a poster for the event appears] Hell On Earth 2006! [everyone yells approval] But now, heed my words: in order to get in to the party, you have to RSVP and get a blue wristband. Everyone is gonna try and get into this party, so if you don't get your wristband in advance, or you're not wearing that wristband at the door, you're NOT GETTING IN!! [the volcanoes fire off another batch of smoke and the minions tremble] And NOW know this: It's a costume party, so you have to wear a costume. BUT... nobody better show up as The Crow! I'm serious. Every costume party there's like fourteen guys come dressed like the Crow 'cause they wanna look hot and hook up. It's lame! If you come dressed as the Crow, you're NOT GETTING IN to the party!! [the volcanoes fire off another batch of smoke and the minions tremble] Go now and prepare!! If you miss my party you are a looozer!! [laughs miniacally and vanishes. The minions tremble once more]
George Burns
Oh boy, a Halloween party up on Earth.
Ghandi
I can't believe he got the entire W Hotel.
Princess Diana
This is going to be the best Halloween ever. [Other minions raise their arms and cheer]
Stan's house, night. The house looks darker than normal, but that could be because the lights are on and jack-o'lanterns decorate the windows and the steps outside.
Stan's House, bathroom, in the dark. The boys has turned it into something of a temple, with candles on the vanity to make it look like an altar, and another two candles on the toilet seat cover. Kyle is in there with five other students: Stan, Cartman, Butters, Token, and Tweek. Kyle looks at the mirror.
Stan
Go ahead, Kyle, do it.
Kyle
[glances defiantly at Stan] I am doing it.
Tweek
No! Don't do it!
Cartman
What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
Kyle
[blinking rather quickly] Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...
Cartman
See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. [starts imitating a hen's cluck]
Kyle
Fine! [hops off the stool and walks past Cartman] Then YOU do it, you're so tough!
Cartman
I've done it lots of times.
Kyle
[pushes Cartman to the stool] Prove it!
Cartman
[now on the stool facing the mirror, laughs a bit] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
Kyle
You're afraid to do it, too.
Cartman
I am not!
Butters
Then do it, if you're not yellow! [Cartman is shocked that Butters talked to him this way, so he raises a fist as if he's about to punch him in the face. Butters flinches.]
Cartman
[turns back to the mirror] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [the door opens and Jimmy enters]
Jimmy
Hey fellas. [Cartman freaks out and falls from the stool.] You should come downstairs. Stan's mom made pa-pizza.
The other boys
[rushing out of the bathroom] Let's go. Yeah, let's go!
Cartman
Oh my God. I crapped my pants. [feels his ass through his pants to be sure] You guys, I crapped my pants! [thinks, then leaves the bathroom] Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
Back at Hell's castle, Satan gazes at his crystal ball. The pale demon enters.
Demon 1
Satan, I must speak with thee.
Satan
[turns around] What is it?
Demon 1
You've invited so many celebrities on Earth to your party that people in Hell can't get wristbands.
Satan
Well I have to invite celebrities or else my party won't be cool.
Demon 1
Satan, I warn thee, do not throw this party at the cost of alienating your friends.
Satan
[childishly] I'm not alienating my friends! I know they come first!
Demon 1
I hope for your sake that's true. You've never thrown a party of this magnitude before, Satan. Be wary. [turns and leaves]
Cathedral of Our Lady Of the Angels, morning. Inside, Cardinal Mahoney addresses a group of Church leaders
Cardinal Mahoney
Halloween has always been a time of evil and darkness. But now it appears that Satan will literally be among us. He is bringing Hell here to Los Angeles, and from what we understand, the gathering is going to be... completely off the hook. [the clergymen begin to murmur amongst themselves] There's more: None of us... are invited. [the murmurs get louder]
Bishop 1
None?
Bishop 2
Satan mocks us.
Bishop 3
His party must be stopped.
Priest 1
Yes, we cannot let evil take over our city, even for a night. [he's holding a leash... which has a small naked boy at the other end of it.]
Priest 2
[an old priest with his own boy] What can we do? [more boys on leashes begin to appear]
Resident Bishop
Tomorrow night, after all of Satan's guests have arrived, we'll call in a complaint about how many people are there. We'll see how long Satan's party lasts... after the fire marshal shows up.
Butters' house, bathroom. Butters is brushing his teeth for the night. He's wearing some Wonder Bread pajamas.
Butters
That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the [begins to choke on the words and spits out some toothpaste] I truly love to brush my teeth. [smiles, then frowns. He looks around, then] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [hesitates a bit] Biggie Smalls... [a second later, Biggie materializes behind Butters]
Biggie Smalls
What the fuck is THIS?!
Butters
AAAAH! [dodges the bullets Biggie begins firing at him.]
Biggie Smalls
Hey! [Butters falls off the stool and gets up, runs to the bathroom door and gets out without getting any bullets in him, and makes his way to the front door.]
Butters
[runs outside] WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [his parents pull into the driveway just as Butters leaves the front steps, and get out of the car]
Stephen
Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!
Butters
I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!
Stephen
You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!
Butters
But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
Stephen
Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!
Butters
AAAAAAAAAAH! [runs back up to his room]
Stephen
[to his wife Linda] ...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?
The W Hotel. Satan is present with his chief demons and the head W staffers.
Satan
So I want the DJ to set up over here, and then the main dance floor area can be this whole area right here.
Male Staffer
What about valets? Ha, how will people be arriving from Hell?
Satan
Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy, they won't have cars.
Female Staffer
Buut we're probably gonna want security at the dimensional vortex gate.
Satan
I want all the servers dressed in skimpy outfits serving all the hors d'oeuvres.
Demon 1
This is getting really expensive.
Satan
Shut up, it's Halloween! This is my night! Then at midnight, for dessert, I'm thinking over here, we bring out a huuuge chocolate fondue fountain.
Male Staffer
Oh yeah, P Diddy had his birthday party here a couple years back and he had one of those.
Satan
Oh, screw that, then. I don't want a fondue fountain if P Diddy had one.
Demon 1
[between his teeth] Does it matter?!
Satan
Yes it matters! I don't wanna do it if Diddy did it!
Demon 1
How about a doughnut machine?
Satan
Did Diddy do it?
Male Staffer
Diddy did do it.
Satan
A full ice cream bar!
Male Staffer
Diddy did it.
Satan
[steps forward in frustration] Damnit, what didn't Diddy do?! [thinks a moment] Wait. I know. [turns right] Yes. It's perfect. At midnight, all the lights go down. The music stops. And then we wheel in... a Ferrari. Only it isn't a Ferrari... It's a cake. And everyone gets a piece.
Demon 1
A Ferrari cake?
Male Staffer
Diddy didn't do it.
Demon 1
Satan, really, the logistics of getting a cake the size of a Ferrari made in time-
Satan
[spins around] This party has to be the bomb! Don't you get it?! [turns around] When everyone sees the Ferrari cake, [makes a fist and says in a low voice] they will shudder and know my greatness!
Demon 3
Hear me, demons! Lord Satan has demanded a Ferrari cake! Now I will take charge of Halloween, and call upon the spirits of Hell's most evil souls! Ted Bundy! [walks into view] Jeffrey Dahmer! [walks into view] And John Wayne Gacy! [walks into view. Each entrance is accompanied by newspaper clippings and actual background shots of their faces] You shall rise once again to walk the earth, for tomorrow is Halloween, and I need you... to pick up Satan's Ferrari cake, and deliver it to the W Hotel!
Bundy
No problem.
Dahmer
We can handle it.
Demon 3
Heed my words: Satan's entire Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake. Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath!
Butters' room, later. He slowly opens his door and looks inside. Quickly, he enters and closes the door, then begins to sneak across the room. He feels a gun against his head and looks up
Smalls
You punkass fool!
Butters
Haaaah.
Smalls
Why'd you summon me?
Butters
P-please don't ice me, homie?
Smalls
You'd better have a good reason, sucka!
Butters
I just... w-was seein' if it works.
Smalls
[lowers the pistol and walks away] Damn! Every Halloween I gots tuh deal with this shit! I'm in hell, mindin' my own business, and the next thing I know, I'm in some kid's bafroom.
Butters
[scared] I Iii, I apologize, Mr. Smalls.
Smalls
[returns and places the tip of the gun against Butters' forehead] You don't understand, fool! I ain't missin' the party!
Butters
W-what party?
Smalls
I already got my wristband, see? [lowers the gun and shows off the blue wristband Satan was passing out] You've got to get me to Los Angeles!
Butters
Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
Smalls
How, punk?! We don't use money in here, nigga!
Butters
Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!
Smalls
[places the tip of the gun against Butters' forehead again] This is your fault, homie! You've gots to get me to that party in L.A., or i'm gonna smoke your ass!
Butters
Oh hamburgers!
Satan's castle. Some of his advisors come to talk to him...
Demon 1
Yes. Yes, Satan. Your Halloween costume turned out perfect.
Satan
[dressed as the Crow] Yeah, it's okay, but everyone thinks Zazul's schoolgirl costume is hotter.
Zazul
[Deomn 3] Ehhhhhhh.
Satan
Zazul, switch costumes with me.
Demon 1
Satan, Zazul worked really hard on his costume.
Satan
Nobody can look hotter than me! It's my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party! Take it off, Zazul. [dejected, Zazul walks away slowly] And what about my Ferrari cake?! Where's the Ferrari cake?!
Demon 1
Relax, it's being picked up from the bakery.
Montage, to the tune of Yello's "Oh Yeah." The bakers have made a life-size replica of a Ferrari and are now decorating it. The bakery in question is Napoleon Bakery. Bundy, Dahmer, and Gacy appear at the door
Bundy
[looking at a map] All right, this is the place. Now remember, you numbskulls, this Ferrari cake is really important for Satan's party, so don't louse it up!
Dahmer
[as Larry] Who's lousing?
Bundy
[as Moe] Come 'ere. [Dahmer draws near, Bundy slaps him] Shut up! [Bundy opens the doors and the three killers go inside]
Head Baker
Can I help you?
Bundy
We're here to pick up the Ferrari cake.
Head Baker
Ohhh yes, it's just about finished. What kind of truck are we loading it up to?
Bundy
We got that flatbed. [Gacy whips out a butcher knife]
Head Baker
Okay well, we're just gonna need to- GYAAAH! [Gacy has just impaled him and begins to slice his body in two by moving the knife towards his head]
Bundy
Gacy, you numbskull, what'd ya kill him for?!
Gacy
[as Curly] I didn't mean tuh. [a second baker comes out of the kitchen]
Bundy
Give me that! [takes the knife from him and smacks him upside the head]
Gacy
Oh!
Bundy
What's the matter with you?! [hands the knife to Dahmer] Take this!
Baker 2
Everything all right? [Dahmer stabs him in the throat with the knife.] Bwa! Gaaaghaghaghagh!
Bundy
You nincompoop! [bops him on the head]
Dahmer
Ow.
Bundy
That was the baker!
Dahmer
He startled me.
Bundy
[looks to his left] Gacy! [goes into the kitchen, where Gacy is stabbing away at a third baker] What'dja kill him for?! [bops him on the head] Siddonw!
Gacy
I'm a victim of circumstance. [Dahmer bops him on the head]
Bundy
[grabs Dahmer by the back of the head] Ahh, who're you hittin'? [picks him in the eyes.]
Dahmer
Ohhhh... [stumbles away]
Gacy
Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk. [Bundy smacks him] Oh!
Bundy
[to Dahmer] Get outta here. [to Gacy] Be quiet. [Gacy makes like he's rubbing blood from his face as he groans] You idiots! Now who's gonna help us load the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed?!
Butters' house, later. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Jimmy, Tweek, and Token are with Butters, and their parents are behind them. Stan's parents are not there. The police have arrived to talk to Butters' parents
Officer
Did your son say anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?
Linda
He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... [upon hearing this, the other boys know what happened and look at each other.]
Cartman
Dude...
Jimmy
Du... du... dude.
Stan's house, moments later.
Stan
[rushes into the living room with the other boys] Dad! Dad!
Randy
[reading his newspaper on the sofa] What?
Stan
If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
Randy
[thinks a moment] Biggie Smalls?
Cartman
You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
Randy
[folds his paper up and rises] All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.
Cartman
How do you know??
Randy
I'm a geologist! [leaves]
Kyle
He's right. It's just a spooky story.
Tweek
Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
Kyle
I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
Cartman
How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
Up in the sky. A jet plane heads towards Los Angeles
Butters
I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-

Smalls
Yo dawg, keep it down.
Butters
Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
Smalls
Oh no! YOU summoned my spirit, YOU're gettin' me all the way to the party! As long as I get to the party in time to party, everything'll be all right. [begins to vanish] Hey! [Smalls is gone]
Kyle's bathroom. The boys are assembled once again to summon Biggie Smalls
Kyle
...Smalls. [Smalls materializes]
Smalls
Oh, God-damnit! [the boys scream and run out of the bathroom, leaving Kyle on the stool]
Stan
It does work!!
Kyle
Holy crap!!
Smalls
[pulls out his gun...] That's it! Now I'm pissed! [...and begins firing away. Kyle and Token are the last to leave.]
The W, moments later. Klieg lights are lit up and light up the night as guests arrive. The camera pans around showing the costumed people waiting outside and the party scene inside. Pumpkin disco balls spin around slowly from the ceiling. Two bartenders mix drinks. A large poster of Satan is up on a wall, a DJ spins records.
George Burns
Hehey, everybody. Check out Hitler. [Hitler appears with a cell phone attached to his ear] He's the "Can you hear me now?" guy. [the minions around him laugh]
Hitler
[moves from spot to spot and asks] Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? [the minions around him laugh again]
Satan
[introducing himself] Everyone quiet! Here he is, the man of the night, SATAN! [four Chippendale men enter, two with leather pants and two with leather briefs, carrying Satan on a litter. Satan is seated on his throne dressed as a girl celebrating her Sweet 16 party. Adolf Hitler wanders by still testing out that cell phone] Get out of the way, Hitler! You're ruining my entrance! Gaau!
Outside, across the street from the hotel entrance, some Catholic clergy have gathered around a pay phone. Cardinal Roger Mahoney places a call
Cardinal Mahoney
Yes, hello? It this the fire department? [the other clergy whisper and remind him what to say, he whispers back] Wait, shh, shh, shh. [normal voice] I need to make a complaint to the fire marshal. [listens for the reply] He's what? Where? [soon hangs up, having gotten nowhere] Damn your evil heart, Satan!!
Resident Bishop
What?
Cardinal Mahoney
The Fire Marshal is at the party! Satan invited him!
Priest
Satan's trickery knows no bounds!
Cardinal Mahoney
That's it! One way or another, we're crashing this party!
Back at the party. Satan is talking to a bouncer
Satan
This is VIP. Don't just let anybody into my VIP area, okay? [the bouncer walks away and an elderly minion arrives]
Frank Sinatra
Hey, Satan, you got a little problem.
Satan
What?
Frank Sinatra
Somebody showed up in a Crocodile Hunter costume. It's really offending some of the other guests.
Satan
Oh jeez. [walks over to the offending guest, who happens to be none other than Steve Irwin, with a stingray attached to his chest. Steve looks around with a smile on his face. Satan arrives] Hey, uh, hi, listen, dude, ya know, the whole Crocodile Hunter thing? It... it's just a little soon, you know? I mean, he just dies a few weeks ago and... it's just not supercool and you gotta leave.
Steve Irwin
But it's me, Satan. Steve Irwin. I am the Crocodile Hunter.
Satan
[thinks a moment] Oh... oh, but then, dude, no costume. Sorry, you gotta go. [two bouncers come and escort him away]
Steve Irwin
Wait! I thought we were friends!
Satan
[watches Irwin leave, then] Oh hey, Sinatra! [walks away]
Male Staffer
Demonius! [approaches a minion wearing a Captain America outfit] Demonius, we have a problem!
Demonius
[the pale elder demon, lifts up his mask] What is it?
Male Staffer
The Ferrari cake! It isn't here!
Demonius
What?? Don't even tell me that!
Male Staffer
It was never delivered to the hotel.
Demonius
Deva! Fetch my Blackberry! That Ferrari cake must get here by midnight! [lowers his mask and moves on]
a short pops up - The Three Murderers, using music from The Three Stooges
The scene is the Napoleon Bakery. Gacy and Dahmer guide the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed. Bundy is at the controls. A man walks by and stops to watch
Man
Do you gentlemen need a hand? [Gacy and Dahmer look; Gacy runs over, jumps on him and stabs him to death with a knife. Bundy notices, jumps out of the crane and runs over]
Bundy
Gacy! [Gacy jumps off the man and cleans the knife quickly] Whatcha do that foor?!
Gacy
I did it for Dahmer.
Bundy
For Dahmer?
Gacy
Yeah. He likes havin' sex with dead bodies. [Dahmer is shown pumping away, from the elbow up]
Bundy
Dahmer! Stop havin' sex with them intestines!
Dahmer
What good are intestines if you can't have sex with them?
Bundy
[slaps Dahmer hard] We gotta get rid of this body before anyone sees it! [brings out a portable saw and begins sawing the body to bits. The crane continues moving the cake around, and no one is at the controls. Bundy finishes cutting up the body] Now get those to the trashcan! [Gacy has the man's head, Dahmer has the man's left forearm and starts eating it] Stop eating that! [takes the forearm and slaps him with it.]
Gacy
Leave him alone! [Bundy slaps him with the forearm] Unh!
Bundy
Cut it! [punches Gacy in the belly] Come 'ere, ya. [takes Dahmer's right hand and places it under Gacy's chin, then forces an upper cut with his own fist]
Dahmer, Gacy
Oh! [both men then take their right hands and move them up an imaginary pole]
Dahmer
There. [Bundy punches them both in the belly and the nose] Oh. [the cable snaps and the cake drops down a bit] The cake! [the pulley is undone and the cake flips over and hits the ground. Pieces of it fly everywhere. The three murderers are covered in it]
Bundy
Oh no!
Gacy
Mmm, Ferrari.
Bundy
[smacks him] What's the matter with you?! It's ruined!
Dahmer
We're gonna get it now.
Back at the party...
A guest
This is a really extravagant party, Satan.
Satan
I know, but just wait till midnight. You are not gonna believe what's coming for desert! [laughs heartily]
The entrance. The bouncers let a Conehead and a maid enter, and the Catholic clergy are next in line. They show their wristbands, which are yellow, not blue
Black Bouncer
Uh, these aren't the right wristbands.
A Bishop
Uh, yes they are.
White Bouncer
Then how come they say "Knott's Berry Farm"? [the clergy get restless, the bouncers hold them back]
Cardinal Mahoney
In the name of Christ, just let us in!
Denver International Airport. The other six boys are now going to Satan's party with Biggie Smalls. Kyle is ordering the tickets
Stan
We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.
Smalls
Not as sorry as you're gonna be, if I completely miss the party!
Ticket agent
Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles boarding in 10 minutes.
Kyle
[gets the ticket and goes back to Satan] See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
Smalls
Yeah, I'm just gonna be pissed if I miss- [begins to vanish again] What the? No! No!
Stan's bathroom. Randy is now summoning Biggie Smalls
Randy
...Smalls. [Bigge Smalls materializes behind him] No way!
Smalls
Motherfucking God-damnit!
Randy
That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!
Smalls
Cool this, sucka! [begins firing at Randy, who's grazed by a few bullets but runs out of the bathroom.]
A second Three Murderers short. This time, the murderers have dressed as chefs so they can make the Ferrari cake themselves
Bundy
All right, listen you mugs! It's now 11:30. That means we only have twenty minutes to bake a new Ferrari cake.
Dahmer
No problem! It just so happens that I went to an Italian cooking school.
Bundy
Yeah? Why'd you quit?
Dahmer
There weren't enough Italians to eat. [a second later Bundy smacks him across the face]
Gacy
Nyak nyak nyak nyak nya-eh [Bundy moves his hand in front of Gacy and then moves it around his head] Nyaaa nyaaaa
Bundy
Get over here! [pulls Gacy by the left ear. Dahmer follows. They go to a clean, ready counter] All right, what's the recipe call for first?
Dahmer
Ten thousand eggs.
Bundy
Gacy, go get ten thousand eggs.
Gacy
You get 'em!
Bundy
[bops him on the head] Shut up!
Gacy
Nyaaaaa! [pokes Bundy in the left eye]
Bundy
Oh! Ohh, wise guy, ey? [pokes both of Gacy's eyes out, leaving him with bleeding sockets]
Gacy
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Bundy
How's that?
Dahmer
Hey! Leave him alone! [gets the knife and stabs him in the ribs]
Bundy
AAA!
Dahmer
[sticks his tongue out at Bundy] Nehhh!
Bundy
Try that again!
Dahmer
[sticks his tongue out at Bundy again] Nehhh! [Bundy grabs the tongue and cuts it right out with a knife]
Gacy
What happened??
Bundy
Shut up! [smacks Gacy with Dahmer's tongue. Dahmer sticks a knife in Bundy's chin, making him fall down. Gacy with loss of eyesight smacks Dahmer's head open with a rolling pin, leaving his brains pouring out]
A men's room in the hotel. Various costumed men are there looking at a man dressed as John Elway tries to summon Biggie Smalls, daring him all the while
Cowboy
He can't do it, he can't do it.
John Elway
All right, be quiet. [laughs] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [the others crowd in for the payoff] Oh I can't do it! I'm too freaked out. [the others laugh at him as he leaves the restroom]
Back at the hotel...
Male Staffer
What do we do?? It's midnight. The Ferrari cake never arrived!
Zazul
This is terrible!
Demonius
[rushes up] It's okay! It's okay! [lifts up his mask] I found a backup! Go ahead and start the ceremony! [the music dies out and the lights go down]
Zazul
[through the party's speakers] Your attention please: It is now midnight! Time for Satan's special surprise. [the guests gather around a raised platform]
A Guest
I wonder what this is going to be.
Satan
[in a low voice, making a fist] Just you wait. [the sound of revving car engines play through the speaker system. The doors open and the surprise is revealed] Yes. Here it comes. [the car is rolled into place and begins rotating counterclockwise]
Zazul
Ladies and gentlemen: a fully edible Acura cake! [the guests cheer, not knowing what Satan really wanted]
Satan
Acura?? But I wanted a Ferrari! [Zazul and Demonius are quickly at his side]
Demonius
We did the best we could; there was a problem.
Zazul
Acuras are really nice.
Satan
IT'S NOT THE CAR I WANTED! THE WHOLE PARTY'S RUINED! [one swing of his left arm and Zazul flies out of the picture]
Demonius
It doesn't matter. Your guests are having fun. They don't care.
Satan
[jumps up and down] IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM, IT'S ALL ABOUT MEEEEEEE!!! [his voice echoes throughout the hotel and no one says a word for several seconds]
Frank Sinatra
Wow, what a jerk.
A Cowboy
Come on, Helen. Let's just go back to hell. I'm suddenly not so hungry for Acura cake.
Satan
Oh God, what's happened to me? I've never been this terrible before. By trying to have a party like those spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV, I've become like one of them.
Zazul
[returns] Satan, don't be so hard on yourself. You're not as bad as they are.
Satan
But I am. Throwing people out, making a big entrance, having these stupid pictures of me all over. Halloween is supposed to be for everyone. Everybody, I'm sorry. This party is for you. It's for all of you who make my life so special. If I don't realize that, then I'm no better than a rich American teenage girl. [the guest begin to applaud the speech] Open the doors! Let everyone in, wristband or no! [everyone cheers at this and the waiting guests rush in, including the Catholic clergy and their naked boys on leashes. Butters appears in the crowd and stops a catwoman powdering herself]
Outside
Butters
Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that? [she hands him her mirror, and he looks into it] Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. [Smalls materializes next to him]
Smalls
What the-?
Butters
Thanks. [hands the mirror back to the catwoman, and she enters the party]
Smalls
I am soo sick of this! Wait, I'm at the party.
Butters
Sure, homie. I got your back, yo.
Smalls
[happily] And it's not too late. Hey, why don't you come in with me?
Butters
Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. [they both enter the party happily]
Inside. Butters is dancing with everyone else, the priests dance with their naked boys, Satan dances with Captain America.
End of Hell on Earth 2006

Go God Go
South Park Mall, dawn. One red car is seen on the parking lot.
EV Games. Advertisements for the upcoming Nintendo Wii are plastered all over the windows. Cartman paces the floor in front of the store
Cartman
[under his breath] Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! [his mom arrives]
Liane
There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?
Cartman
I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
Liane
When does it come out?
Cartman
Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
Liane
[takes him by the hand] It's time for school
Cartman
[yanks his hand away and runs back to the store] No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.
Liane
Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. [pulls him away again]
Cartman
Noo!! Nooo!!
South Park Elementary, day. Mrs. Garrison's voice is heard
Mrs. Garrison
Principal Victoria, it is wrong! [she's at the principal's office, her back to the principal's desk.] It is wrong and I simply will not do it! [walks back to the desk] I care about my students, and I will not fill their heads with lies! [pounds the desk for emphasis] I am NOT teaching evolution in my class!! [Mr. Mackey is also present]
Principal Victoria
Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.
Mrs. Garrison
Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!
Mr. Mackey
M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven.
Mrs. Garrison
I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff!
Principal Victoria
Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.
Mrs. Garrison's classroom, later. The kids are chatting and moving about the classroom. Cartman is blabbering incoherently
Cartman
How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
Stan
It's still three weeks.
Cartman
Oh God... [shivers like someone in withdrawal] Okay, how long now?
Kyle
Will you shut up already?! [Mrs. Garrison enters and isn't too happy about her lesson]
Mrs. Garrison
All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution.
Butters
Oh boy!
Mrs. Garrison
Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP. But I've been told I have to teach it anyway. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this: [goes up to a large poster of evolution and begins pointing things out with her pointer.] In the beginning we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its [waves his left hand limply] mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this. [points to a rodent] retard frog squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... And then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you! [faces the class. A new girl is seated in the front row, looking around] So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!
Cartman
[hopping out of his chair and running out] HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
Mrs. Garrison
Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.
EV Games, next time. Cartman again paces the floor in front of the store.
Cartman
Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! [a store clerk notices and walks over]
Clerk
Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster. [he goes back inside, and Liane walks up]
Liane
Eric, you're coming home right now!
Cartman
Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
Liane
It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
Cartman's room, night. He's sprawled out on his bed in his pajamas, his eyes open. He can't sleep, tossing and turning every few seconds. He looks at his clock: 2:15.
Cartman
Oh God!
He throws himself back on the bed and squeezes his eyes shut. He peeks at the clock, then squeezes his eyes shut again, turns over... Moments later he's on his pillow, his left leg dangling over the foot of the bed. Next, he's on his belly, looking over the foot of the bed. Next, he's tossing and turning, and sees the time now: 2:16. He gets up and walks to the wall calendar, where he has Nov. 19 marked - a Sunday, the day the Wii comes out. Halloween is marked off, so it's now less than three weeks. He logs onto the Internet and fires up his browser - he gets an ad for the Wii, coming in three weeks. He's now downstairs watching early-morning TV. He paces in front of the TV, then heads for the fridge. Finding nothing to eat, he goes back upstairs and looks at the clock in his room: 2:18. He throws down the clock and throws a fit
Cartman
Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
The bus stop, later in the morning. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are waiting for the bus.
Cartman
You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
Stan
Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.
Cartman
I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
Kyle
Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
Cartman
[assertively] No. There is something I can do.
Kenny
(What?)
Cartman
All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right? [turns around] I think I figured out how to do it.
Stan
Do what?
Cartman
Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
Kyle
No.
Cartman
It's simple science, Kyle.
Kyle
You'll die, retard!
Cartman
I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
Stan
Dude, no way.
Kyle
Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
Cartman
I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! [walks away in a huff]
South Park Elementary, day. The new girl, her parents, and Mrs. Garrison are in the principal's office.
Father
Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!
Mrs. Garrsion
I told you this would happen, didn't I?!
Principal Victoria
Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-
Mr. Triscotti
We have worked years to instill the teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter, and in one fell swoop, you try to destroy everything we did!
Mrs. Garrsion
I hear ya.
Principal Victoria
Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.
Mr. Triscotti
You most certainly will!
Daughter
But Dad, I want to learn everything.
Mr. Triscotti
No you don't! Shut up! [takes his daughter and leaves the room]
Mrs. Garrsion
Well, I told you. We should leave evolution out of the classrooms.
Principal Victoria
It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! [Mr. Dawkins enters the office]
Mrs. Garrsion
Re-replaced??
Principal Victoria
Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist.
Mr. Dawkins
[courteously] Charmed to meet you. Ms...
Mrs. Garrsion
Shut up, faggot! Principal Victoria, I can teach my own class!
Principal Victoria
You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!
Mrs. Garrison's classroom. Richard Dawkins is the guest teacher now. He takes some chalk and .
Mr. Dawkins
Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us. [although all the kids have pencil and paper out ready to take notes, only Kyle is actually writing anything as Dawkins lectures. Mr. Dawkins himself delivers his lecture in a scholarly voice.]
Mrs. Garrison
Whatever.
Mr. Dawkins
[glances over, then continues] It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.
Mrs. Garrison
[relating Dawkin's points to his own] Retarded fish-frogs.
Mr. Dawkins
[a bit shocked] Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification.
Mrs. Garrison
Well, you're a faggot! [the look of shock returns to Dawkins.] Continue.
Mr. Dawkins
You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.
Mrs. Garrison
So you are saying that we're all related to monkeys.
Mr. Dawkins
[puts the chalk in the holder below the blackboard] Well yes, basically, we are.
Mrs. Garrison
Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people!
Mr. Dawkins
Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!
Mrs. Garrison
What about the fact that if I believe in this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?
Mr. Dawkins
Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.
Mrs. Garrison
[rises and walks up to him] AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!!
Mr. Dawkins
I never covered it up.
Mrs. Garrison
And if I'm a monkey, then I might as well act like a monkey, huh?! [begins to dance around like a monkey, hooting and hollering. He lowers his pants and poops into his left hand.]
Mr. Dawkins
What on earth are you doing?? [now Butters is the one taking notes]
Mrs. Garrison
Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!! [throws the log of feces at Dawkins and gets him on his forehead and on the left side of his sweater]
Mr. Dawkins
AAAH!
The principal's office, once again.
Mrs. Garrison
Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements.
Principal Victoria
Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.
Mrs. Garrison
What??
Mr. Dawkins
Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students.
Principal Victoria
Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
Waiting area outside the office. Garrison and Dawkins walk in
Mr. Dawkins
Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?
Mrs. Garrison
What?!
Mr. Dawkins
Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion.
Mrs. Garrison
[softens immediately] You d-you do?
Mr. Dawkins
I've never met a woman with so much... fire
Mrs. Garrison
Well I... [begins preening] I do bring down a woman's wrath now and again. [slight giggle]
Mr. Dawkins
So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful. [snaps out of it] I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-
Mrs. Garrison
No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, dead.
Mr. Dawkins
Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?
Mrs. Garrison
Well, [preens again] well, I suppose we could have a little steak or something. [Dawkins smiles, Garrison smiles back]
The hallway. Kids are milling around. Around the corner comes Mrs. Garrison, jumping joyfully
Mrs. Garrison
I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation! [skips away, towards the front doors] Oh boy, what'll I wear?! [opens the doors and skips out] Hey everybody!
Cartman's house, day, kitchen. Humming, Liane enters the kitchen with groceries and snacks, including doughnuts. She sets them down on the counter, takes an ice cream and heads for the freezer. She opens the freezer door
Cartman
[in the freezer] Ey!
Liane
[jumps back in surprise, dropping the ice cream] Whoa!
Cartman
Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!
Liane
Eric, get out of there. [tries to pull him out, but he kicks her hand away]
Cartman
[resisting all of Liane's efforts] No! No, it's too soon!
Liane
[pulls him out of the freezer] Now Eric, this has gone far enough! [sets him down and goes down on a bended knee] You need to learn to be patient!
A door opens and Butters appears. Before him is Cartman, dressed in heavy jacket. Cartman has some equipment on his back and an ice pick in his right hand.
Cartman
Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
Butters
Go where?
Cartman
You're gonna help me freeze myself.
Butters
[looks at Cartman a while, then] Okay. [walks away to get his coat, smiling]
The Rockies, far from town. Two small figures walk forward in the snow. The camera gets progressively closer, and the figures turn out to be Cartman and Butters
Butters
Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
Cartman
[stops and begins digging ] Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away. [finishes digging a hole, tosses the ice pick away, and prepares to step down into it] I have to be hidden. [removes his jacket and gives it to Butters] That's good. [begins to gather the snow around him and then faces Butters, who's shocked at this turn of events] And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
Butters
Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
Cartman
No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
Butters
[not so sure, casts his eyes down] Yeah...I guess it is...
Cartman
All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
Butters
I got it. [looks around] Big Tree. Oval Rock.
Cartman
All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed. [Butters looks at Cartman once more, then leaves. Butters turns to look at Cartman again] Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
Butters
Oh jeez! [turns around and walks away quickly]
Cartman
[all alone now] Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
Buca di Faggoncini, evening. Mr. Dawkins and Mrs. Garrison are having dinner there.
Mrs. Garrison
So I told my gynecologist, "you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you!" [they both laugh at the story.]
Mr. Dawkins
Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys.
Mrs. Garrison
Hehyeah, almost.
Mr. Dawkins
You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist.
Mrs. Garrison
Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff.
Mr. Dawkins
Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?
Mrs. Garrison
Oh I'm not... I'm not totally into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God.
Mr. Dawkins
Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?
Mrs. Garrison
[Thinks a moment] You're riiight. It's so simple! God is a spaghetti monster. Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened! [stands up] Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!
Mr. Dawkins
Really?? Oh that's wonderful!
Mrs. Garrison
No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard!
Mr. Dawkins
You're so welcome!
Mrs. Garrison
Would you like tuh... [preens again] head over to my place for dessert?
Mrs. Garrison's bedroom, night. Mr. Dawkins is giving it to Mrs. Garrison doggy style, hard. Both moan and make other sexual noises.
Mrs. Garrison
Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!
Mr. Dawkins
Oh Ms. Garrison!
Mrs. Garrison
Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!
In the Rockies, Cartman slowly freezes. The camera closes in
Cartman
Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
his hearbeat stops as he expels one last puff of air. The camera pulls back as wolves howl in the night. Night turns to day. Cartman's face has turned blue. An avalanche knocks down the tree and covers up the oval rock Butters is supposed to check for when he returns. It also buries Cartman, who is in pajamas. A time-travel sequence begins, which takes him forward in time to the year 2546. There, the block of ice that contains him is picked up and thawed. Three curved surfaces come together to form an egg around Cartman, and the egg is moved to a bed. The three pieces fall apart and disappear. Three items appear - an electronic eye, a small pump, and a vibrator.
Medic
We have a pulse. [Cartman comes to, coughs, and sits up. The aliens gather around]
Alien 1
Can you... understand me?
Cartman
Where am I?
Shvek
My name is Shvek. You are safe.
Cartman
Safe where, butthole?!
Shvek
My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.
Cartman
[looks around] What??
Shvek
You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years. [Cartman jumps off the bed and runs to the nearest window, where he sees a city unlike any he's seen before.]
Cartman
Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! [suddenly looks tired.]
Medic
Please be careful. You are frail.
Cartman
Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
Analyst
[brings up a holoscreen and presses a few buttons on it. A picture of the Wii appears] Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive gaming device used in his time.
Cartman
Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
Medic
Young man, you don't seem to understand. [goes down on one knee] Your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years.
Cartman
I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
Shvek
We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.
Cartman
No... [looks up at the ceiling and] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Dawkins is back teaching about evolution. Mrs. Garrison looks quite enamored
Mr. Dawkins
You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here.
Mrs. Garrison
[thinking] That's my man.
Mr. Dawkins
So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen.
Mrs. Garrison
That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God.
Mr. Dawkins
Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-
Stan
Well there could still be a god.
Mrs. Garrison
What?!
Stan
Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
Mrs. Garrison
[brings out a triangle and starts ringing it] Uh oh, retard alert! Retard alert, class! [leaves her desk and walks up to Stan's] Do you believe in a flying spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?!
Stan
I wasn't talking about spaghetti. [Mrs. Garrison picks him up, desk and all, and carries him to the front of the class.]
Mrs. Garrison
Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair! [sets him down next to the blackboard, goes for a dunce cap, and places it on Stan's head. The cap reads "I HAVE FAITH"]
Mrs. Garrison's house, night. She and Mr. Dawkins are in bed. She runs her fingers through Mr. Dawkin's chest hair.
Mr. Dawkins
Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right.
Mrs. Garrison
What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.
Mr. Dawkins
Yes, but to be so bold about it... [looks away] I've just never seen a woman with such... balls.
Mrs. Garrison
[gets up and sits on Mr. Dawkins with the blanket over her chest] You've just been too soft on religious people in the past. Think about it, Richard. With your intellect and my balls, we can change the future of the world.
Mr. Dawkins
Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God.
Mrs. Garrison
You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you.
Mr. Dawkins
Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again.
Mrs. Garrison
Oh, all right. [lowers the blanket and the breasts appear. The implants... are not balanced. The left nipple is huge and lower compared to the right one, and the stitches are still visible.]
Mr. Dawkins
Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm. [begins to shake his head between the breasts, which has the effect of a motorboat's engine revving up.]
Mrs. Garrison
OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!! [Mr. Dawkins revs up again]
Butters' house, day. He and Dougie play in the backyard as Professor Chaos and Geneeral Disarray. Toy action figures and various toy vehicles litter the yard
Butters
Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!
Dougie
[fires at the action figures] Pehpew Pehpew! [walks over and kicks them down]
Butters
Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
Linda
Butters? [she appears at the sliding door entrance with two policemen behind her] Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?
Butters
[a bit afraid, slowly] Who, me?
Linda
It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?
Butters
[looks right, then left, trying to figure out what to say...] No ma'am.
Linda
Okay. [closes the sliding door and walks away with the officers]
Dougie
Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! [Butters turns and joins him]
Butters
Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
Dougie
Okay.
Butters
Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
Dougie
[long pause] ...Yeah.
Butters
Well, like what?
Dougie
...Like, you die.
Butters
...Die??
Dougie
Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.
Butters
Oh hamburgers!! [runs away]
the Rockies. Butters and Dougie reach the spot where Cartman is frozen. Butters calls out to Cartman
Butters
Eric! Erihic!
Dougie
You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
Butters
He told me to!
Dougie
He's dead for sure.
Butters
Wait! [looks around.] It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
Dougie
Oh my God...
Butters
[begins to dig frantically] Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!
Dougie
[trying to stop him] Butters ButterButterBUTTERS! [Butters stops and looks at him] We have to get out of here!
Butters
What??
Dougie
Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! [runs off]
Butters
But I just did what he told me!
Dougie
Come on, we have to leave!!
Butters
Oh jumping Jesus! [follows Dougie. They head back to town]
Back to the future. Cartman sits at a desk
Cartman
This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. [puts his head in his hands and starts to weep. A door slides open and three of the aliens enter the room]
Shvek
Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.
Cartman
What?? [hops onto the desk] Really?? [jumps down and exults] YES!! YES!!
Medic
It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire.
Cartman
So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
Shvek
Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first.
A meeting room. The three future humans talk to Cartman there
Shvek
You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason.
Medic
Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special.
Cartman
I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
Shvek
You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist.
Cartman
[strokes his chin and thinks] And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
Medic
We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League.
Cartman
Who? [the medic is about to reply when something shakes the building they're in]
Shvek
What in Science's name was that?! [outside, an enemy ship first at the building and leaves a hole in it. The ship docks at that hole and the invaders pour into a cargo room. The UAL members and Cartman enter the cargo room at the other end.]
Medic
Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!
Shvek
Oh Science, help us! [a laser battle between the two groups begins]
UAA Member 1
[yellow hair, green suit] Science damn you, Unified Atheist League!
Cartman
Who are they??
Shvek
The Alliance Atheists. We're at war with them. [the battle rages on, with laser shots going back and forth. The laser shots turn out to be syringes which inject the victim with poison. Once the load is fully inside the body, the head explodes. Men on both sides explode and die.]
UAL Member 1
[a syringe gets him] No! [his head explodes]
Cartman
Jesus Christ!
Shvek
Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being. [gets a syringe to the neck] Oh my Science. [his head explodes and the battle is over. The UAA closes in on Cartman, its guns drawn]
Cartman
I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
The UAA ship's bridge. Cartman enters with UAA members escorting him.
UAA Member 1
Put me through to the Allied Atheist Allegiance!
UAA Member 2
[black hair] Onscreen.
UAA Member 1
Look, Allied Atheist Allegiance! We have the time child!
AAA Leader
Science damn you, United Atheist Alliance!
UAA Member 1
Now you see, foolish sea otters, that we are the atheists in control!
AAA Leader
It won't make a difference! This is the dawning of the sea otter! Know this, time child! I shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy!
Cartman
What??
AAA Leader
Otters! The time has come! Sound the nafferty!
Sea Otters
The nafferty! [a giant otter walks over to a very fanciful horn and blows into it.]
AAA Leader
[rises on a platform and turns around. A lens drops down from a contraption he has to his left ear and lands on his nose] So, it begins!
End of Go God Go

Go God Go XII
This episode begins with an expanded montage of last week's time-lapse imagery. First you see the town, the mall, and a house. Next, Cartman and the Wii at EV Games. Next, scenes from his night of insomnia, including him checking his calendar and the Wii's Web page, then watching TV. Then, Eric is shown begging his friends to help him freeze himself. Then, a collage of Eric hiding in the freezer, talking to Butters, and walking to the designated spot with him. Then, scenes of the avalanche and Eric getting frozen. Then the years begin to roll, and scenes of humanity's future appear. They are: the scene of the avalanche, a scene of devastation, the room where Cartman is taken to be thawed, his meeting with the high UAL command, the UAL building being attacked, a shot of Earth from space, the UAA storming in to fight the UAL, the battle between the two factions, the UAA closing in on Cartman, the voyage away from the UAL building, across a desert; the onscreen communication with the AAA, a shot of Earth's future, a sea otter blowing into the nafferty, and the final shot of two ships leading the camera to the city the UAL is based at
Narrator
The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman cannot wait for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Unable to cope with the wait any longer, Eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks. But a freak avalanche makes Eric impossible to find, and so he remains frozen for 500 years.
The next scenes all involve Cartman playing a part in the future. The background is the UAL's city. First he's dressed in a blue military outfit. Next, he's running with a robot dog, then firing off a laser gun, then of him and the bog in a vehicle. The background changes to the UAA's ship. Cartman is walking with the UAA members. The AAA is shown firing at them. Cartman and the UAA now sport helmets and go forth. The background changes to the AAA's city. The AAA has captured Cartman. Cartman plays chess with a sea otter. Cartman enjoys flying around upside down in a room of UAL members doing the same thing. Cartman is then shown in a different blue suit, and finally, a fleet of shuttlecraft fly to a new city. At this new city, ostriches are seen walking around, with otters riding them. The city is either in ruins or shabbily built
Otter Leader
Whoa, steady! [motions to the otters] This way, otters! [other otters move forward on their ostriches]
Otter 1
This is it. New New Hampshire. We have risked much bringing you here, Time Child. [the camera pans left to show Cartman on an ostrich and wearing goggles.]
Cartman
Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
Otter 1
Don't let the time child out of your sight. He could try to run.
Cartman
[goggles now above his eyes] We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry about. [the leader's ostrich makes a noise]
Otter Leader
Something is spooking the ostriches.
Cartman
Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
Otter Leader
Here it is! We have arrived.
Blavius
[Sea Otter 1] Hold! [the ostriches stop at a large entrance] This is it, Time Child. [the building's name is shown: New New Hampshire Museum of Technology] The old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. Let's get what you want, Time Child, and get out of here.
The otters escort Cartman to the Museum of the Past. Cartman looks around and finally spots the Wii.
Cartman
Over here! [runs over to it] Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. [shatters the glass case protecting it and removes it]
Blavius
All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay.
Cartman
Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. [switches hands in holding the Wii, presses a button on his left glove and disappears]
Blavius
NOOOO!
Otter Leader
It was a trick!
Blavius
SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!
UAA transporter room. As various UAA members wait, Cartman appears on the transporter pad
Cartman
I got it! I got the Wii!
UAA Leader
Time Child! You've returned!
UAA 1
We thought for sure you had died in the in the Phobart plant.
Cartman
[turns and leaves the transporter pad] Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side. [turns around as he reaches the door] Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. [the door opens and Cartman walks into the hallway outside the room. The leader and his assistant look at each other]
UAA Leader
TC, wait!
Cartman
[ruonds a corner] Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome! [almost walks into another UAA member] Get out of my way!
UAA Leader
[catches up with Cartman] You gained the otters' trust?! Were you wearing an information crystal?!
Cartman
Here. [takes off the information crystal and hands it to him]
UAA 1
Science be praised. This could end the war!
UAA Leader
You've done a great thing, TC. [Cartman turns right...] How can we repay you?
Cartman
[...and enters an elevator] Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! [the doors close]
Cartman's room. A maintenance guy is trying to figure out how to connect the Wii to the screen.
Cartman
Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
Maintenance Guy
Uhh, what kind of output does this have? This is some ancient Super-VHS output or somethin'. I can't connect it to your float screen.
Cartman
There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
Maintenance Guy
It may be the future for you, but I can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output.
Cartman
You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-dammit! I am so fucking sick of the future! [starts throwing a tantrum, throwing things around]
UAA Woman
[entering the room] TC? What's wrong?
Cartman
I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
UAA Woman
Well, we're all glad you're back. I know somebody who's missed you very much. Come on in, K-10. [steps aside to reveal K-10, who walks in]
K-10
Bark bark. Hello, Eric. I have missed you.
Cartman
Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
A United Atheist Alliance meeting.
UAA Leader
Fellow atheists: the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance. They have started digging for clams in sector J7. If we mount an all-out attack, we can wipe out their food supply!
UAA 2
But, those are civilian otters.
UAA Leader
We cannot tolerate the otters! Their Science is flawed! Their answer to the Great Question is different from ours.
UAA 3
Yes, but... sending out all our ships at the same time... it would leave our city exposed!
UAA Leader
...That's why we have to be super-duper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it.
Unified Atheist League headquarters. The UAL elders gather to discuss the situation
UAL 1
[hanging upside down from a jet-powered platform] The United Atheist Alliance is about to send out all its defense ships to take down the Allied Atheist Alliance's clam fields.
UAL 2
Praise Science. This is your chance, young Shvek, to avenge your father's death.
UAL 3
Careful, son. Just because their Science leads them to a different answer to the Great Question doesn't mean we have the right to kill them all.
Shvek
No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great. [walks away from the table and stands before a wall] Let us not forget the great Richard Dawkins who finally freed the world of religion long ago. [a painting is shown, with Dawkins in it] Dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future. [More of the painting is shown: Mrs. Garrison appears] But it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough. You have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you. [turns around] Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!
Cartman's room at UAA headquarters. Cartman watches TV on his float screen, K-10 standing nearby. A commercial comes on
Announcer
With new Glade monvert cleaner, you can make your monvert sparkle like never before.
Woman
My monvert's never looked so clean. [apparently, a monvert is a phallic device]
Cartman
God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! [switches channels. A picture appears briefly in which a reporter is about to mention an attack, but that vanishes. Three bored kids appear seated at a coffee table]
Boy 1
Agh! I'm so bored.
Boy 2
There's nothing to do.
Cartman
Tell me about it.
Boy 3
Hey, I know! Let's crank call people in the past!
Boy 1
Huh?
Boy 3
I just got... [brings out a big box] the Crank Prank Time Phone! [the other two boys marvel at it]
Singers
Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.
Announcer
New, from Blasbro, it's Crank Prank Time Phone!
Boy Announcer
I just dial a random number on the keypad, enter a date and year on the debilibrator, and...
Boy 1
Wow! Someone from the past is on the line! [talks into the phone] Hello? Is there a refrigerator running? Well then, you'd better go catch it! [the boys have a good laugh]
Singers
Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.
Cartman
[now interested] What?
Boy 2
Uh hi. It's the year 1973, right? Could I speak to Al Coholic, please? [the boys laugh again]
Announcer
Crank Prank Time Phone comes with debilibrator [looks like a space-age microphone], antimatter fusion cone, and 30 plain HF watt triggers. Warning: Crank Prank Time Phone is for entertainment purposes only. Making anything OTHER than crank calls to the past could affect the present and end your existence. Crank Prank Time Phone is not intended for the use by otters.
Cartman
Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
K-10
Why does it matter? Bark bark
Cartman
Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself. [walks forward a few steps] Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
K-10
Bark bark. That call is for crank calling only. Using it in the way you describe is illegal.
Cartman
I care! Where's the closest toy store??
K-10
Working, bark bark. The Jarvanian shopping complex. But it is not open yet.
Zeebod's Toys, some time later. K-10 stands by as Cartman paces the ground in front of the store, just as he did in the past waiting for the Wii
Cartman
Come on! Come on!
Voice
Store is now... open. [the storefront lights up like a Christmas tree and the doors open] Welcome
Cartman
Ugh, finally!
Clerk
Welcome to Zeebod's Toys
Cartman
I want one of those time-phone things.
Clerk
Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?
Cartman
Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
Clerk
[pulls up a small float screen and calculates the cost on it] All right, that'll be 6000 credits. [a second float screen pops up with the price on it]
Cartman
Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
Clerk
This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.
Cartman
Look, I have to have one of those phones!
Clerk
Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits. [Eric sighs and looks down]
K-10
Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark.
Cartman
How about a robot? How much for the robot?
K-10
Awww.
Clerk
[puts the phone away] Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.
Cartman
[turns around and walks away. K-10 follows] Science-dammit! [stops] Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
K-10
Working, bark bark. Access.
Cartman
I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
K-10
Working, bark bark.
Otter Bay. evening. A sign there says "Allied Atheist Alliance." Blavius addresses a large crowd of sea otters
Blavius
The United Atheist Alliance has taken the bait! Soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields! And while their ships are away, the United Atheist League intends to attack them! Our plan has worked perfectly! For when the United Atheist League attacks the United Atheist Alliance, we will charge in and kill them all! Our Science, our answer to the Great Question shall prevail!
Otters
Hail Science! Hail Science! Hail Science!
Blavius
And I will personally kill the Time Child, and eat his entrails on my tummy!
The turn of the 20th century, day. An early blue car rolls down the street and the driver honks his horn. The car passes by a Colonial-style house. Inside the house, a woman vacuums a rug with an early vacuum cleaner when the phone rings. She turns off the vacuum cleaner and starts moving towards the phone
Man
I'll get it, darling. [approaches the phone and picks up the receiver. His wife goes back to vacuuming] Hello? Hello?
Boy 4
Uh yes, hello? I'm calling for Mr. Wall?
Man
I'm sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here.
Boy 4
Oh. Is Mrs. Wall there?
Man
Nno, there are no Walls here.
Boy 4
Then how does your roof stay up? [he and his friend begin to laugh]
Man
Oh, I see! Is this the Johnson boys from down the street?!
Boy 4
No, we're from the future. [stifled laughter]
Man
Very funny!
Boy 5
Hi, uh, I'm a Pepper, and I'm wondering if you'd like to be a Pepper too?
Man
God darn ya! [hangs up. The two boys laugh]
Boy 4
Yeah.
Boy 5
That was a great one! [the doorbell rings and Boy 4 gets up to answer it. Cartman, dressed as a maintenance man, and K-10 appear at the entrance]
Cartman
Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
Boy 4
Oh. Okay, I guess.
Cartman
[steps inside] Come on in, Bob. [K-10 enters the room] All right, just let me use my tools... [pulls out a gun and fires at Boy 4, who is instantly trapped in a bubble, floating in the air. K-10 does the same to Boy 5.]
Boy 5
Hey!
Cartman
[walks up and takes the time phone from the coffee table] Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! [walks out the door with K-10]
Boy 4
Science H. Logic! What a jerk!
Otter Bay. evening. The otters are arming each other
The Wise One
[walks in with a cane] Silence, otters!
Otter 1
It's the Wise One
Otter 2
The Wise One speaks.
The Wise One
This is not the path we should be taking. Will more bloodshed end anything?
Blavius
[floats up to him on a hovering throne] Wise One, our answer to the Great Question is the only one based on good science.
The Wise One
Science, reason, is that really all there is?
Blavius
They are not a logical race, Wise One! They go around chopping down trees for tables, when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on. How logical is that?!
Otter Leader
Yes! [walks up to a painting of Dawkins and Garrison] The great Dawkins said we cannot tolerate those who don't use reason! How reasonable is it to eat off wood instead of your tummy?
The Wise One
Well perhaps the great Dawkins wasn't so wise. Oh, he was intelligent, but, some of the most intelligent otters I've ever known were completely lacking in common sense. Maybe, some otters do need to believe in something. Who knows? Maybe, just believing in God makes God exist.
Otter Soldier
Kill the Wise One!
Otter 3
Kill the Wise One! [the other otters crowd him in and start attacking]
The Wise One
Whoa, wait wait! [perishes amid the pummeling]
Cartman's room, night. He's sprawled out on his bed in his pajamas, his eyes open. He can't sleep, tossing and turning every few seconds. He looks at his clock: 2:15.
Cartman
Oh God! [throws himself back on the bed and squeezes his eyes shut. This time, the phone rings. He gets up to answer it. The caller is the Time Child] Hello? [he gets static until...]
Time Child
[in a higher pitch] Hello? [Cartman is surprised to hear his own voice on the other end] Are you there?
Cartman
Who is this?
Time Child
[to K-10] No, no, I have me. [to his past self] All right, all right, listen! Listen to me carefully! You need to be patient!
Cartman
What?? Who the hell is this?!
Time Child
It's me.
Cartman
Me who?!
Time Child
Me you!
Cartman
What?!
Time Child
I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!
Cartman
Oh very funny, Kyle!
Time Child
It's not Kyle, it's you!
Cartman
Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
Time Child
I'm trying to do you a favor, dumb-ass!! Just listen to me!
Cartman
Listen to this! [puts the phone to his ass and farts into it, then slams the phone down on its base] Dickhead. [the phone rings again. Cartman picks it up and quickly slams it down again.]
Time Child
[surprised at his own reaction in the past] What an asshole!
Butters' house, later. The phone rings in the kitchen. Butters walks in to answer it.
Butters
Hello? [he gets static until...]
Time Child
Butters? Butters!
Butters
Eric? Is that you?
Time Child
Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t!
Butters
[looks around unsure what to make of this strange call] Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
Time Child
No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!
Butters
But... [notices Cartman entering through the front door] but you're here right now. [Cartman walks into view]
Cartman
Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
Time Child
[hearing his past self] No! Don't listen to me! Tell me to go screw myself!
Butters
Huh??
Cartman
Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
Butters
But, you're telling me not to go with you.
Cartman
What?? [enters the kitchen to talk to his future self] Who the fuck is this?!
Time Child
Aw dammit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die!
Cartman
Suck my balls!
Time Child
No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!
Cartman
...Okay, you have one minute.
Time Child
Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?
Cartman
[shocked] Are you spying on me?!
Time Child
No, I am you, you stupid asshole!
Cartman
Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself! [hangs up and pulls his hood back over his head] Come on, Butters, we're going!
Butters
Oh, all right then.
Time Child
[frustrated] God I hate that guy!!
UAA war meeting, a full room
UAA Leader
My friends, the time has come! May Science give us the courage to do what we must! Launch all defensive ships to sector J7! Take out the otters' clam fields! [a fleet of UAA ships takes off]
UAL headquarters. The UAL leader ponders the painting of Dawkins and Garrison before him
UAL Aide
Sir! The United Atheist Alliance has sent out all their ships. Their capital is now unprotected.
UAL Leader
[turns and issues the command] Then begin the attack! Science be praised.
A vast meadow, day.The ground begins to vibrate, then the first ostrich zips by. A couple more follow, then a bigger group of them, then the whole army of them, all with otters on them riding into battle
Otter Leader
Kill the table-eaters! In the name of Almighty Science! [the otters ride on]
Kyle's house, day, kitchen. The phone rings and Kyle arrives to answer it
Kyle
Hello? [he gets static until...]
Time Child
Hello? Kyle?
Kyle
Hello?
Time Child
Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going?
Kyle
What do you want?!
Time Child
Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?
Kyle
I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
Time Child
No, see, I know it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually did freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future.
Kyle
[with half-closed eyes] ... Uh huh.
Time Child
No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously. Here, talk to my robot dog. [backs up to hand the phone to K-10.]
K-10
Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark.
Kyle
... I'm hanging up now.
Time Child
No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer.
Kyle
Suck my balls, fatass.
Time Child
... I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle. Just stop me from freezing myself, and I will get down on my knees, and I will suck your balls. I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle. [a car honks its horn at Kyle's end and he looks over. It leaves]
Kyle
Aw Goddammit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! [hangs up]
Time Child
Kyle? [as he asks, everything around him changes. His float screen goes from red to green, his suit goes from blue to saffron with light blue cape, the plant turns leafy, and the floor goes from orange to navy] Kyle!
KIT-9
[K-10's new look] Eric, I really think you should stop calling the past. You could change the present.
Time Child
Well I don't notice anything different, KIT-9! Do you?
KIT-9
I guess not, meow meow.
Time Child
[begins to notice the differences] Hm, I see... [the building is shaken hard by something striking it] Hey!
KIT-9
Meow meow. [the UAL ships swarm in and fire at all the buildings in UAA territory]
Time Child
Heeeeey!
KIT-9
Meow meow.
UAA Woman
TC! We're under attack!
Time Child
By who?!
UAA Woman
We have to get to the War Room! It's the only safe place!
The War Room. Officials there mill around trying to keep things under control. KIT-9 and Cartman arrive. Cartman has the Crank Prank Time Phone
UAA Leader
The United Atheist League is bombing the city! We're defenseless!
Cartman
This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
Tactical Officer
Sir! The sea otters are advancing! They've broken through the east portal!
The outskirts of the UAA city. The otter army reaches the edge of the city
UAA Leader
What?! Three-way phone channel onscreen! [the main screen lights up with two windows. On the left window appear the UAL leader and the UAL, on the right window appear Blavius and the otters]
Shvek
[from UAL headquarters] What are you otters doing?! This is our attack!
Blavius
[from AAA headquarters] Yes. And we're attacking both of you!
UAA Leader
You fools! This will be the end of us all!
Blavius
Then accept our answer to the Great Question, and we will withdraw.
UAA Leader
Your answer to the Great Question is illogical!
Cartman
What is the Great Question?
KIT-9
What atheists should call themselves.
Shvek
Unified Atheist League is the most logical name.
UAA Leader
>Unified Atheist Alliance makes more sense.
Blavius
No! Allied Atheist Alliance! That way it has three A's! That is the logical choice!
Shvek
So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.
Tactical Officer
Forward missiles launched, sir!
Cartman
I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
KIT-9
But Eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in history.
Cartman
Who?
KIT-9
Your teacher, the one called Garrison.
Cartman
Garrison? But he's an asshole.
Mrs. Garrison's bedroom, night. Mr. Dawkins is giving it to Mrs. Garrison doggy style, hard. Both moan and make other sexual noises. The phone rings
Mrs. Garrison
Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!
Mr. Dawkins
Oh Ms. Garrison!
Mrs. Garrison
Dammit, who the hell is calling?!
Mr. Dawkins
I'll tell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah... [answers the phone] Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?
Cartman
It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
Mr. Dawkins
[stops] An emergency?
Cartman
I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
Mr. Dawkins
I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.
Cartman
Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
Mr. Dawkins
Sex-change operation??
Mrs. Garrison
Uh oh.
Mr. Dawkins
[pulls out and protects his genitals] Uuuuugh! You're a man?!
Mrs. Garrison
Not anymore. I've been fixed. [Dawkins runs for his clothes] Richard, hold on. I can explain.
Mr. Dawkins
Explain?? How can I be so stupid?? [runs out of the house with his pants on, carrying the rest of his clothes]
Mrs. Garrison
Richard, come back, please! [Dawkins does NOT return, and Garrison loses her faith in atheism in a flash] Well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer!
The battle in the future. The War Room has been destroyed, but Cartman and KIT-9 are still there
Cartman
Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! [Cartman's present changes again, and now he's wearing a gray suit with orange cape. Also, he's back at UAL headquarters, which is quiet and undamaged]
Shvek
[enters from a side door] All right, Eric. Are you all set to go?
Cartman
[turns around] Go... Right... Where am I going? [he was facing a panel of UAL and UAA members]
UAA Leader
[joins Shvek from the left side] W-we told you: we're sending you home. With the Crank and Wank Time Machine.
Blavius
[joins them both from the right side] Don't worry, my son. When you return to your time you will merge with your other self. It's all very Zen.
Cartman
Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
Shvek
Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time.
Medic
Yes. Long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence.
Cartman
So there is no war now in the future.
Blavius
Of course there's war. The stupid French-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii.
All
Yeah!
UAA Leader
But now the moment has come to send you back to your time. [some rings descend from above and a blue light appears, indicating that beaming is about to begin]
Shvek
We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.
Cartman
[wondering] And what was that purpose again?
Shvek
We explained that to you already.
Cartman
Right... [a bird flies in and sets down next to him.]
COCKA-3
Goodbye, Eric. I will mess you. Squawk squawk
Cartman
I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.
UAA Leader
So long, Eric. And tell everyone in the past for us, that no one single answer... is ever the answer. [the rings go back up and take Eric with them.]
EV Games. Cartman is pacing in front of the store again
Cartman
Noooo! [his future self is beamed into his body and he checks himself] I'm back. Wow! I'm back!
Liane
There you are, Eric.
Cartman
Mom! Mom, they did it!
Liane
Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.
Cartman
[happy, for once] No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
Liane
But, honey, it's only September. That... [points] Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.
Cartman
What? NO! [runs up to the window and sees that his mom is right] NOO!! [turns around and moves away from the storefront] You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
Liane
Who are you talking to, muffin?
Cartman
I can't wait two months! [runs back to the doors] I can't! There has to be a way around this!
Clerk
Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.
Cartman
Hello?
Cartman the Time Child is calling from a different future, in which everyone floats around on large purple-pink bubbles
Time Child
Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?!
Cartman
...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! [hangs up and leaves the store.]
End of Go God Go XII

Stanley's Cup
The South Park Gazette, est. 1997, day. A bicycle rests on the sidewalk outside the office. Inside, Stan talks to the editor.
Editor
[The nameplate on his desk says Mr. Jarvis] Being a delivery boy for the South Park Gazette is a noble privilege.
Stan
I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
Mr. Jarvis
Oh waaa waaa waaa! We've all got problems, pussy! Get used to it! [picks up today's paper] You aren't delivering the papers on time!
Stan
[insistent] My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. [behind him, outside the window, a tow truck pulls up]
Mr. Jarvis
[noticing] Is that your bike out there? [the driver leaves the cab and moves towards the back of the truck.]
Stan
Yeah. Why?
Mr. Jarvis
'Cause it's being towed.
Stan
[turns around] What?? [walks to the door and looks out its window, then leaves the office while the driver locks the bike in place]
Outside the Gazette office.
Stan
Hey, hey! What are you doing?!
Driver
This your bike?
Stan
Yes!
Driver
It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. [the list shows the tow truck belonging to Jerry's Towing. The driver activates the crane, which slowly lifts one end of the bike up]
Stan
No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
Driver
Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. [gets back into the cab and closes the door]
Stan
[climbs up the door towards the driver] No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike! [the truck moves forward and Stan hops off. He moves towards the bike.] Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! [catches up to the bike and grabs one of the pedals, but that just jerks him up and down a few times as the wheel on the ground moves the pedals. Stan hits the ground several times, getting bruised until he finally lets go of the pedal and rests on the street. He looks on helplessly as the truck keeps moving and his bike disappears in the distance]
Park County Government Center, day. A man sits in his office, and a knock is heard at his door.
Judge
Yes? Come in.
Stan
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
Judge
Yes! Come on, Mr. Marsh. I've been told all about your case. Impounded bicycle, $83 owed to the county. Maybe you should get a job.
Stan
I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
Judge
[pulls out a pre-loaded record player and puts the needle onto the record, which begins playing, then says] Stan Marsh is a bright young man. He's got a great family, a promising paper route; only problem is, [removes the needle from the record] his bike's been impounded! [puts the needle back on the record, on another song] But now, he's about to find out that getting his bike back isn't so easy. [pulls the needle off again and puts the needle's arm in its resting place]
Stan
[several seconds later] Look, I really need my bike.
Judge
[puts the record player aside] Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you, because then you wouldn't learn anything..
Stan
What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
Judge
Whoa whoa, hold on. I've looked your case over and I think maybe we can cut a little deal here. According to your background check, when you were in kindergarten, you played on the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.
Stan
...Yeah?
Judge
Well it just so happens that the pee wee hockey team this year needs a coach.
Stan
[apprehensive] Me?
Judge
[pulls out the record player again and plays it] Stan Marsh is a washed-up fourth grader. He's got no job, no bicycle. And his only way out is to coach... [pulls the needle off the record] a pee wee hockey team! [puts it on again] And now, he's about to find out that to coach, you've got to grow.
South Park Recreation Center, looking more sophisticated than before. A hockey rink is in place, with kindergartners inside moving around. Stan is near the center's entrance moving towards the rink. Kids fall and get back up as they struggle to skate. Stan reaches the rink's entrance and looks inside
Stan
Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here. [the kids move towards him, tumbling. Stan decides to go in and meet them] We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
# 10
Who are you?
Stan
My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
# 8
Coach, I have to go potty.
Stan
All right, fine, go ahead.
# 8
...By myself?
Stan
S- hold it a while, okay?
# 7
What does "passing" mean?
Stan
When you shoot the puck to another player.
# 15
[chubby boy] My mommy said I'm as big as the sky.
# 3
Coach, Morgan spit on my foot!
Morgan
I did not!
Stan
All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
# 13
[downcast] I can't play goalie. [he's bald, save for a few hairs hanging down from inside his helmet]
Stan
Why not?!
# 13
My doctor says I'm not supposed to.
Stan
What, you got asthma or something?
# 3
No, he has cancer.
Stan
[off guard] What?
# 8
Nelson has leukemia. It's already spread to his bone marrow.
Nelson
I don't wanna have cancer! [covers his eyes and begins to weep]
Stan
Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.
# 13
But why me, coach? Why?
# 7
Coach, why do people get cancer?
Stan
[feeling overwhelmed] Oh Jesus, can we just practice?
# 10
Are we gonna get cancer if we play with Nelson, Coach?
Stan
NO! [a rival team and its coach walk up to Park County]
Coach
Well well well! If it isn't the Park County Losers! [the rival players laugh. They're from Adams County]
# 7
Oh no! Adams County! [the Park County players back away, leaving Stan out front]
Coach
We just thought we'd come check out the ice for the game tomorrow. [steps forward and offers a handshake] Gavin Throttle, coach of the Adams County team.
Stan
[steps forward to reply] Hey. [Coach Gavin withdraws his hand]
Gavin
Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?
# 7
Our coach isn't gonna let us lose!
Park County
Yeah!!
Gavin
[steps forward again] Fine, if that's the way you want it. See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!
Adams County
Right! Follow! [they leave the rink]
# 6
Coach, please don't let us lose to Adams County. My daddy will beat me again.
Stan's house, night. It's been a long day and Stan looks tired. He opens the front door and enters.
Stan
Jesus Christ. [his parents walk up to him]
Sharon
Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!
Randy
Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
Stan
I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
Randy
Oh, well that's good.
Sharon
What kind of job?
Stan
I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
Randy
...What? With the-? [turns around] What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.
Stan
I'm not playing, I'm coaching.
Randy
Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
Stan
[tense] What are you talking about?
Randy
Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
Stan
[relaxes] I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.
Randy
Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!
Stan
[heads upstairs] I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. [Randy moves towards him a bit, but Stan's door closes, and Randy turns to Sharon]
Randy
What are we goin' to do, Sharon??
Sharon
What?
Randy
Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
Sharon
Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
Randy
Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
Stan's room, night. He's now asleep and begins to dream.
Announcer
And we're about out of time here in another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game. [a boy skates towards the camera] And that's # 7, Stan Marsh, skating towards the goal, sort of, but h doesn't have the puck. [players nowhere near him just fall randomly. Two players manage to move towards a puck. The South Park player falls onto the Denver player, who kicks the puck away]
Denver Goalie
[farts, and realizes he did more than that] I crapped 'em! Oh me I crapped 'em! [leaves the goal defenseless]
Announcer
Oh, it appears the goalie has pooped his pants. [the pucks moves towards Stan and stops right in front of him. The spotlight lands on him. The announcer stands] Oh and look at this! Little Stan Marsh actually has a shot at the goal!
Crowd
Ohhhh!
Randy
[with longer hair] Stan?? Shoot it! [Stan isn't sure what to do]
Announcer
Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win!
Kyle
You got it, Stan!
Randy
[quite animated. Sharon holds him down] Take the shot!! Take the shot!! [Stan takes the shot and the puck moves towards the goal, but stops just inches from success. The buzzer sounds and no one wins] NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Announcer
Ohoooo, that's the end of the game! How disappointing. [Stan looks around, scared.]
The master bedroom. Randy wakes up from his dream in a fit, jumps up and runs around the bedroom. Sharon sits up in fear
Sharon
Randy, what's wrong??
Randy
OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.
Park County Hockey Rink, day. Inside, Stan is with his team.
Stan
[blows his whistle] All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
A Man
Coach? Hey coach. [the man and his wife appear] Could we talk to you, please? [Stan leaves the rink to meet them]
Woman
We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?
Stan
Oh
Mr. Brown
Our little Nelson, he's... taken a turn for the worse, I'm afraid! His cancer is... real ba-a-a-ad. [Mrs. Brown tries to soothe him, but begins to weep softly]
Stan
Ohhh.
Mr. Brown
Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it. How am I supposed to do it, coach? How do I look a five year old child in the eye and tell him he's not gonna live? [frustration leads to anger] You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!
Mrs. Brown
Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean to take it out on you, coach.
Mr. Brown
[frustrated again] No, I don't mean to take it out on you, coach. It's just... [fiddling with his had nervously] I don't know what to say to him, coach. Neither of us do. What do you say tuh... somebody who's dying, huh?
Stan
... I don't know.
Mr. Brown
Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you.
Stan
No, I think you oughta.
Mr. Brown
Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him.
Mrs. Brown
Please, coach, he's... [turns aside to cry] he's counting on you!
Mr. Brown
[bows several times] Please, coach, he's counting on you!
Hell's Pass Hospital, day.
Nelson's room. A banner over his bed reads "We Love You, Nelson" and a balloon reads "Get Well".
Stan
[enters the room] Oh uh, hey Nelson.
Nelson
Oh. [coughs] Hi, coach.
Stan
Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
Nelson
Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying. [Stan walks up to him] Coach, what's it like when you die?
Stan
Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
Nelson
How come I have to die now?
Stan
Ogh.
Nelson
I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?
Stan
Goddammit, dude, I don't know.
Nelson
I'm sorry.
Stan
No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
Nelson
I think so.
Stan
Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? [gives him a thumbs up and walks away]
Nelson
Thanks, coach. [Stan is close to the door...] Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?
Stan
No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
Nelson
Well then, will you just... win for me?
Stan
Okay. [pause. He steps out of the room and closes the door. Behind the door is the judge, waiting. He has his record player with him. He starts playing it...]
Judge
Stan Marsh has always lived a carefree life. But in the blink of an eye, what seemed important before can all be put in perspective. Stan Marsh is... "Bummin' on Cancer." [takes the needle off, and Stan walks away.]
Park County Hockey Rink, night. Spectators begin to stream into the recreation center.
Announcer
Welcome, parents, to this Pee Wee hockey match between Park County and Adams County. [Sharon walks in and sits down]
Adams County
[Gavin leads them in the cheer] Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!
Stan
[walks up to Gavin] Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
Gavin
Come to surrender, coach?
Stan
[takes him aside] Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
Gavin
HA! I don't think so, Coach. We're gonna beat you into the ground, cancer or no! [turns and heads back to his team] Win! Win! Win! Win!
Adams County
Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! ...
The Park County locker room, before the game. Stan and his team hold a meeting.
Stan
All right, guys, listen. [turns around] I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. [the players look at each other]
# 6
Sooo, if we lose we're gonna kill Nelson?
# 7
Oh Jesus, no!
# 3
I don't wanna be a murderer!
Stan
Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
# 7
If we lose are we gonna get cancer?
# 13
Oh no!
# 15
Ohhh..
# 8
Oh no.
# 6
I don't want cancer.
The game begins. Adams County players tap their sticks to the drum rhythm going on over the speakers.
# 7
They look pretty strong, coach. I think Nelson's gonna die for sure. [Stan looks a bit awed at the kid's assessment. The referee skates up to the center of the rink. Blur's "Song No. 2" begins to play.]
Gavin
Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it! [the ref throws down the puck and the skaters move... and fall over] Yeah! Let's go Adams!
the spectators look bored. Nothing is happening in the rink except for the Park County goalie picking his nose. The clock shows 5:05 left in the first period
Stan
Let's go, Park! Come on!
Still nothing is happening in the rink. An Adams County player waves to his mom, she waves back. The camera moves around excitedly
Gavin
That's it, Brian! Kill him! [motions to Stan, then returns to watching the game]
Stan
Get near the puck! [Park County players fall. No one is getting near the puck. No. 15, the goalie, continues picking his nose. Fast forward to the end of the third period. An Adams County player is struggling to keep his bladder in check. One second left in the game]
Announcer
And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie.
Stan
Tie? Well, what does that mean?
Judge
[walks up with his record player and plays it] Stan Marsh was supposed to win it all. The big game. A dying boy's hope. Only problem is, [pulls the needle off the record.] he tied! [puts the needle on another track] And now, he's about to find out that tying isn't the same as winning. [pulls the needle up]
# 10
So did we kill Nelson or not?
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Stan peeks into Nelson's room
Stan
Hello?
Nelson
Coach.
Stan
How are you feeling?
Nelson
I feel pretty good, except for the cancer. [coughs] Coach? Does God hate me?
Dr. Doctor
Oh, hello Coach.
Stan
Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?
Dr. Doctor
Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied.
Stan
Oh boy.
Nelson
[coughs] Oh. My cancer hurts.
Dr. Doctor
He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo.
Stan
But what can I do?
Judge
[rushes into the room with his record player] Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news! Our hockey team has just been invited to play against Denver County during a Colorado Avalanche game!
Nelson
Wow. [smiles] At the Pepsi Center?
Dr. Doctor
Look! He's coming around again.
Nelson
That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?
Stan
Well, ah, I mean...
Judge
[sets the record player on the floor and plays it] Imagine. If there was one game, one chance, to make everything right. Stan Marsh is being given that chance. But to win, he's gonna have to pull out all the stops in... "Stanley's Cup"! Rated R. [turns the player off]
Stan
Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.
Nelson
All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.
Dr. Doctor
[takes Stan aside] Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays.
A restaurant booth, day.
# 6
Coach! What the hell were you thinking?
# 3
We can't beat Denver County.
Stan
Well, sure we can.
# 6
Last time we played Denver they scored seven times.
Stan
Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
# 8
No, 'cause they're gonna kill us.
Stan
They're not gonna kill us.
# 6
That's what Steve Irwin said about those stingrays.
Stan
[thinks a bit] Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
# 3
No. In the movies, they always go out and find a kid who's really good to join the team.
Stan
Hey that's right. We need a ringer. [smiles]
# 13
We need a Canadian. [Next thing you see is Ike shooting pucks into the goal. Stan and Kyle watch. Stan smiles.]
# 6
Wow, he's good.
Park County
Yeah!
Kyle
Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
Stan
It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. [Ike is wearing #2]
Park County
Yeah!
Kyle
All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
Stan's room, night. He's drawing up plays for his team to carry out. The camera moves enough to include Randy, in his briets at the door, in the shot
Randy
Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
Stan
Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
Randy
Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again. [sits at the foot of the bed] Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go. [gets up and looks at Stan] I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying "That's my son!" [turns around and leaves the room, then turns around again] And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. [turns left and walks away]
The Pepsi Center at Denver, night. Your Colorado Avalanche vs. The Detroit Red Wings. The match is underway and the Red Wings are on offense. One of the Red Wings fires the puck towards the Denver goal, but the Denver goalie blocks it by catching it with his left glove
Announcer
His shot is blocked! What a great save! [a man holds up a banner that reads "GO AVS." The buzzer sounds and the score is tied at 2-2 at the end of the second period] And that's the end of the second period. The score is tied 2-all. [the teams go to their locker rooms] And now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest Pee Wee hockey players.
Stan
[at an entrance with his team] All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?! [all the players are with him in their own ways.] All right, let's go win!
Official
[rounds the corner and spots them] Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight.
Stan
Huh?
Official
The other Pee Wee hockey team didn't show up. There's nobody for you to play. Thanks for makin' the trip though.
Park County
We came to play.
Stan
Sso then we win?
Official
No. Nobody wins.
Stan
Hey. Hey, you can't do this. [the Avs come up behind Park County] We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
Official
Well, you've got nobody to play, there's nothing we can do.
Stan
But it isn't supposed to end like this!
Av 1
Hey, hold on a second. If these kids have been through a lot of emotional changes, then they have to play.
Av 2
Yeah.
Official
Well, who are they gonna play?
Av 1
They can take our place.
Av 3
Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings.
Stan
[turns around and face the Avs] Play the Red Wings?
Judge
[pops in with his record player and plays his record] Stan Marsh coaches a Pee Wee hockey team. But now [pulls the needle off the record] they're going to play in the big leagues. [plays his record again] They've got small bodies but big hearts. Stan Marsh is... going professional. [pops out]
Av 1
All right! Give 'em hell, boys!
The Avs
All right! Yeah!
The Pepsi Center, night, third period.
Announcer
It's a tie game here in Colorado as we get set to start the final period. Your attention, please: for this third and final period, the Detroit Red Wings will be playing... the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.
Spectators return to their seats, and the period begins. The Red Wings take possession of the puck and begin to knock out Park County players left and right. One Red Wing smashes a Park County player into the plastic
Denver Fans
OHHHHHHHHH!
Stan
Jesus Christ! [another Red Wing takes the puck to the goal, but kicks another Park County player into the plastic off to the side] Stop! Stop this!
Man
Let them play!
Fans
Let them play! Let them play! [even Randy is cheering for this. The Red Wing finally fires off the shot... into the goalie]
# 15
EEEK-ugh [lies there, helpless. The shot is good, and the Red Wings get another point.]
Another Red Wings skates up to # 7, jumps, and steps on his face with the edge of the skate, then skates away
Stan
Hey, can they do that??
Ike
[another Red Wing beats him to a bloody pulp] Ow, no. Oh! [a Red Wing fires the puck at # 8 and draws blood out his mouth]
# 8
AAAGH! [the Red Wings fire pucks into the goal at will and rack up lots of points. For some reason, there's a 4th period and the score is 31-2 Detroit. One final shot from Detroit and the final score is 32-2]
A Red Wing
Yeah! We did it! We did it! [Queen's "We Are The Champions" begins to play]
Red Wing fans celebrate the victory. Red Wings skate around the rink and hug spontaneously, and hi-five each other.
Randy
NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO! [Sharon restrains him. Red Wings 14 and 30 French-kiss]
# 6
[with a black left eye and a bloody mouth] I hate you, Coach. I hate you. [The Red Wings coach kisses his wife, then shakes an older man's hand]
Red Wings Coach
Thank you, Dad.
Former Coach
I'm proud of you, boy. [they give each other a long, warm hug. An NHL official takes a huge trophy over to the Red Wings coach and his team]
Nelson's room at Hell's Pass Hospital. Large text blinks "Red Wings Win!" green and yellow on his television.
Fans
Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings!
Nelson
No hope. No... hope... [dies right there, and his vitals flatline]
Fans
Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! [the coach celebrates his victory by waving the trophy around]
End of Stanley's Cup

With Apologies to Jesse Jackson
Wheel of Fortune. The graphics roll by
Announcer
And now back to Wheel of Fortune!
The camera closes in on Randy, who's got his hands clenched, his thumbs up, and a big grin on his face. He pumps his fists softly. A new car waits behind him to win it
Pat Sajak
All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!
Randy
Thanks, Pat!
Pat Sajak
You've got some family here watching tonight. [a shot of Sharon, Shelly, and Stan in the audience. Sharon waves, then claps. Stan waves]
Randy
Yeah, they're all rooting for me.
Pat Sajak
And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?
The town bar. A crowd has gathered to watch the show. Kyle and Ike are there with their parents, Butters is there with his
Randy
Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!
Jimbo
That's us!
Stephen
Hehey! [both thumbs up]
Man 1
[amid other chatter, voice only] Hey Randy!
Jimbo
Good luck!
Back to the studio.
Pat Sajak
Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is [the words appear onscreen as Vanna White gets ready to turn the letters on the board] People Who Annoy You.
Randy
Okay. [deep exhale]
Pat Sajak
As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E. [Some of the letters light up blue and Vanna turns them around: ERS] We just need three more consonants, and a vowel.
Randy
Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
Pat Sajak
And a vowel?
Randy
[quickly crosses his fingers in both hands and grits his teeth] An O please.
Pat Sajak
Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here. [more letters light up blue and Vanna turns them around. Randy claps softly] The category is People Who Annoy You. [the letters are NGG, but no O: N_GGERS. Randy stops clapping] Audience, keep quiet, please. [one of the cameramen peeks out from behind the camera - he's black]
Randy
Uh... Well, uh...
Pat Sajak
Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.
Randy
I know it but I don't think I should say it.
Pat Sajak
Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.
Randy
Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle! [beat] Niggers! [the audience is stone quiet. The blacks in it are angry. Randy gets the buzzer for the wrong answer and drops his arms.] Huh? [Vanna goes to turn the last letter around - A - then walks back to her post and looks at the ground] Ohhh...
Stan
[covers his eyes] Oooo. [Sharon and Shelly are stunned]
Randy
[subdued] Oh naggers. Of course, naggers. [sheepish grin] Right.
Pat Sajak
[awkwardly] Uhh, can we cut to a... [back at the bar in South Park] Can we cut to a- [the station goes off the air. The bar patrons are confused]
On the road back home. Stan still has his hand over his eyes. Sharon has her eyes closed and her head in her right hand
Randy
[sniffs, then] Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?
Sharon
I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
Randy
What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
South Park Elementary, morning. The kids arrive at school.
South Park Elementary hallway. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny walk into view.
Kyle
Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
Cartman
Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
Stan
Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
Cartman
Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token. [points at the camera. Dramatic music swells. The camera then looks at Token, who's putting some books into his locker] He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
Stan
No he's not. [looks at Kyle] Is he?
Kyle
I don't know.
Stan
I just need to explain things. [walks up to Token, who's finished with the locker and holds only a binder in his right hand] Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
Token
Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning on the news.
Stan
Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
Token
Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.
Cartman
Ohhhhhhhh?
Token
It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.
Cartman
Oh shit here we go! [gets really excited and cuts in between them, yelling] It's on! Race war! [goes back and yells at one end of the hall] Race war! Race war! [comes back again and yells at the other end of the hall] Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! [returns, just itching to see Stan and Token fight]
Stan
Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
Token
That's easy for you to say, Stan.
Cartman
[softly] Yeah, come on! Here we go!
Stan
Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
Token
That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
Cartman
[softly] Race war! Come on! Race war!
Token
If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not fighting anybody. [turns left and walks away]
Cartman
Token forfeits! [takes Stan's left hand and holds it up in victory] Whites win! [lets go and twirls away] Whites win! [runs to one end of the hall] Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
In an office somewhere, day.
Randy
I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. [The camera shows Jesse Jackson behind a desk, with three officials around him]
Jesse Jackson
[elbows on armrests, hands interlaced] The puzzle you were solving was "people who annoy you".
Randy
Uh well, like anybody else thought it was "naggers". I mean, right?
Jesse Jackson
Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.
Randy
Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with [making sure he gets it right] African-Americans.
Jesse Jackson
[thinks a moment] Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?
Randy
Y-Yes, absolutely.
Jesse Jackson
[long exhale] Very well. If you want to apologize, I will accept. [rises from his chair and approaches Randy]
Randy
Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.
Jesse Jackson
Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing. [takes off his coat, rolls up his shirt sleeves...]
Brian
[with camera] Ready to go, sir.
Jesse Jackson
[...unzips and drops his pants, then drops his briefs and sticks his ass out at Randy] Kiss it.
Randy
Huh?
Jesse Jackson
Apologize. Kiss it.
Randy
You want me to kiss your-
Jesse Jackson
That's right. [gyrates his butt around] Apologize.
Randy
Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh... [genuflects] Let's see here uh...
Jesse Jackson
[gyrates his butt around again] Apologize. [Randy kisses Jesse's ass for a few seconds and the picture is taken. It appears in newspapers like the New York News]
South Park Elementary, day, hallway. The bell rings and Stan approaches Token at his locker.
Stan
Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
Token
Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.
Stan
Well, yeah.
Token
[throws his backpack into the locker] You just don't get it, Stan!
Stan
Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!
Token
[spins around angrily] Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! [storms away]
Stan
[softly] He told my dad he was...
The school gym, later. All the students have been called to assemble there.
Woman
[dressed in a sharp business suit] Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words. [Stan looks over at Token in the row before him] In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself, a little person. Who knows what a little person is? [Butters raises his hand] Yes? Over here?
Butters
A midget?
Woman
Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!
Mr. Nelson
[waddles in to some fanfare, swaying back and forth] Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today? [the music stops. Cartman chuckles, then lets out a laugh, and can't stop] I would like to share with you all my-
Cartman
No! Dude! No fucking way! [laughs] Dude! [resumes laughing]
Mr. Nelson
That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-
Cartman
[shakes his head back and forth, then rears back, laughing all the while] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
Mr. Mackey
[appears next to Mr. Nelson] Eric, be quiet!
Mr. Nelson
No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon. [Cartman continues laughing, and even nudges Stan a few times to get him to laugh, but Stan just gets annoyed.]
Cartman
Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. [resumes laughing. Mr. Nelson gets pissed off, but holds it in]
A comedy club - The Laugh Factory. Randy is walking down the street and notices the club
Randy
Ooh! An African-American performer at the comedy club. [rushes over]
Inside the club an African-American is doing his routine
Comedian
And so I said to my wife, "You told me to kill the damned cockroach! Don't yell at me for making a mess!" [the audience laughs. Randy is in the audience, laughing] We've got a great crowd here tonight. Now, how many people here are actually from Colorado? [a few audience members and Randy clap and holler] Ya got nothin' better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh? [that gets a big laugh from the crowd. The comedian points to Randy] Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? [the crowd falls silent, and Randy looks uncomfortable] Yeah. I know you. You're the guy that said "nigger" on Wheel of Fortune. [the audience laughs. Randy lets out a weak chuckle] Look! Everybody! It's the "nigger" guy. [big laughs all around]
Man 2
Hey, it is him.
Comedian
Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the "nigger" guy. [waves, and the audience waves with him] Say, "Hi, 'nigger' guy!"
Audience
Hi, "nigger" guy! [Randy waves back and now has a guilty smile on his face, which quickly changes to a guilty frown]
Comedian
That's all right, "nigger" guy. You know we just playin'. [the crowd roars with laughter and claps]
Randy
Yeah... No problem...
Comedian
Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're right out of "Far Out Space Nuts". Maybe "nigger" guy has one. You got one, "nigger" guy? [the audience roars with laughter again and Randy leaves, his head hung in shame. He wanders the streets]
A run-down part of the city, night.
Man 3
[walks by with a woman] Hey look, Betty. It's that "nigger" guy. [Randy sighs and walks on]
Three kids
[passing by on skateboards] Nigger guy. Nigger guy. [they leave, Randy sighs again and walks on. He stops by a 24-hour store to get some aspirin]
Clerk
[white] Hey. What do you think you're doing? [an Asian clerk stands behind him]
Randy
I just... need some aspirin.
Clerk
You aren't welcome in this store, "nigger" guy.
Randy
Fine! [leaves the aspirin on the counter and rushes out the door]
South Park Elementary, day, principal's office. Mr. Nelson is there to lodge a complaint. Principal Victoria sits at her desk, Mr. Mackey stands to her left.
Mr. Nelson
Principal Victoria, I am very concerned about the behavior of one of your students.
Principal Victoria
Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.
Mr. Nelson
Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all. [waddles to his left] Words are like bullets, and I let 'em pass right through me. [waddles back] I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?
Mr. Nelson
You don't understand. [waddles around] You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder-
Mr. Mackey
Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.
Principal Victoria
Very well, Mr. Nelson. [presses a button on her phone] Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman. [the door opens and Cartman walks in and immediately bursts into laughter upon seeing Mr. Nelson.] Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
Cartman
[stops long enough to respond] Oh. Did I hurt its little feelings? [resumes laughing]
Mr. Nelson
You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless.
Cartman
[before Mr. Nelson finishes talking] Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! [stomps his foot on the floor, points to Mr. Nelson, and laughs. Principal Victoria buries her face in her hands]
Mr. Nelson
You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.
Cartman
[stops] Barely! [starts up again]
Mr. Nelson
[assertively] No matter how you act, I can rise above it!
Cartman
[stops] "Rise above it!" Get it? [starts up again]
Mr. Nelson
[steps up to Cartman] Shut your fucking mouth!
Principal Victoria
Mr. Nelson! [Mr. Nelson blanches. Cartman looks at him, then cracks up again and falls on his ass in laughter]
Mr. Nelson
He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking
Cartman
Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
Mr. Nelson
[grimaces] Aaaaaaa!
South Park, night, Viggo's Coffee House. A sign outside announces "SPOKEN WORD CONTEST TONIGHT," Inside, a pair of black hands drums away on some bongo drums. Next, Randy is shown onstage, the drummer in the background
Randy
Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how I try, people just say "Hey! There's that 'nigger' guy." [no response from the crowd] Everywhere I go, it's always the same. Everyone just thinks of me as that one single name. "Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Hi Nigger Guy!" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. When will it end, will there ever be a time? When I can be thought of as more... than just "Nigger Guy". [no response from the crowd] Respect. [throws up the V sign and walks off stage]
South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Stan walks up to Token again
Stan
Token! Hey, wait up. [Token turns around] I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
Token
Sooo black people are midgets? [turns around and walks away. At the far end of the hallway Mr. Nelson rounds the corner and walks towards Stan.]
Stan
God dammit!
Mr. Nelson
Excuse me, over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here. [heads towards the gym. The available students follow him]
The gym. Only the fourth graders are there
Mr. Nelson
I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, "Hello, fatso!"
Craig
...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.
Mr. Nelson
He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets. [turns around and sees Cartman] All right all right, here he comes. [walks off-screen. Cartman enters the gym]
Kids
"Hello, fatso!"
Cartman
Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?! [walks up to Kyle accusingly] Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?! [Mr. Nelson walks out towards the entrance, then curves around to stand behind Cartman] I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
Mr. Nelson
Now you know how it feels. [Cartman turns around and looks at him, then bursts out laughing] You'd better shut up or i'm gonna kick your ass!
Cartman
Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
A conference hall, somewhere. Randy speaks before an entire group made up of only black people.
Randy
And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation. [gets good applause for that] It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the "nigger" guy. [no response] You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on "Wheel of Fortune", you know and... and when people call me... "nigger guy"... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. [no response]
Black Man
Is this "nigger" guy serious?
Randy
Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! [walks off.]
Outside, night. He walks towards his car when a truck passes by. It screeches to a halt and backs up to stop in front of Randy. Two rednecks are in the cab, a third is in the bed
Driver
Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!
Skeeter
[the redneck in the cab] Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! [reaches down and grabs a shotgun. Randy takes off running.]
Randy
Awww! Awwww! [the rednecks give chase. Skeeter just shoots in the air, aiming at no one]
Skeeter
Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.
Passenger
Wooo! [pumps his left fist]
Randy
Whoa! [sees a clearing across the street and runs into it. The truck passes it, screeches to a halt, and backs up. Randy turns around and sees the three rednecks standing before him, shotguns aimed at him]
Skeeter
Where you goin' "nigger" guy?
Randy
Please I, I don't want any trouble.
Skeeter
Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on "Wheel of Fortune"!
Driver
Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, "nigger" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.
Passenger
You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!
Randy
[holds his hands out in a blocking position] What do you want?
Skeeter
What do we want? [he and the passenger laugh] We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!
Man 4
[from screen left, out of nowhere] Leave him alone.
Passenger
Hey... That's that other "nigger" guy.
Skeeter
Huh?
Passenger
That's the guy from Seinfeld, used the N-word a whole bunch o' times.
Driver
Michael Richards? Well, son of a bitch!
Skeeter
Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two "nigger" guys!
Man 5
[from screen right] Make that three.
Passenger
Mark Fuhrman?
Skeeter
Who?
Passenger
He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.
Driver
Well what is this? A "nigger" guy convention? [two more men appear beside Randy, Richards and Fuhrman]
Richards
We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.
Driver
Come on, Skeeter. [he and the other rednecks back up towards their truck] These "nigger" guys ain't worth our trouble.
Skeeter
[from the truck bed] Damn "nigger" guys! [the other two get into the cab] We'll be back! [the truck starts up and the rednecks hoot and holler and fire off their weapons as they speed away]
Richards
[puts his hands on Randy's right shoulder] You'd better come with us.
An abandoned barn nearby, moments later. The five men go in
Richards
Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee.
Randy
What's going on here?
Fuhrman
[pours Randy a cup of coffee and gives it to him] We've been following your story since we first saw it on the news. Don't worry - you're with friends now. Dale here used the N-word in a racial joke at work. Scott used the plural N-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence.
Scott
They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.
Richards
We're all just like you.
Randy
No. [smacks Richards' hand off his shoulder and puts the cup down] No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.
Richards
I made a mistake too. [moves forward a bit] I was trying to be funny! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.
Randy
You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
Richards
[turns around and gets in Randy's face] You really think that matters?! [moves to Randy's ear] You really think all those people out there see a difference? Oh, they might say your racial slur was more accidental; they might even laugh about it. But at the end of the day, all you are to them is just another damn "nigger" guy! [Randy swallows a bit] Oh, you don't like that, do ya?
Randy
No.
Fuhrman
Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all.
South Park, day, the neighborhood.
Stan
Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
Token
I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!
Stan
I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
Token
No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!
Stan
What the hell do you want from me?! [Butters appears across the street, rather out of breath. Upon seeing them, he runs over]
Token
Nothing!
Stan
Then stop being mad!
Token
No!
Butters
Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! [Butters runs off. Stan and Token look at each other silently then shrug, as they turn to follow Butters]
The community park. The kids have gathered to see Cartman and Mr. Nelson fight.
Butters
C'mon now Eric, come on now.
Kyle
Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
Cartman
It's a midget, dude.
Mr. Nelson
["Down with the Sickness" by Disturbed starts playing] Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point.
Cartman
Hahaha, no- no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. [the kids urge them to fight, and the match begins]
Cartman gets Mr. Nelson ...in a half-Nelson, then picks him up, carries him around 360 degrees, then throws him off. Mr. Nelson gets under Cartman to pick him up and throw him over his back, but ends up just tickling Cartman, and Cartman laughs.
The United State Senate. Randy is addressing the senators.
Randy
Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words. [Randy is flanked by Fuhrman and Richards] But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term "nigger guy".
Senator 1
"Nigger guy"?
Randy
Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
Richards
Yeah! That's right!
Randy
Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
Skeeter
[with his two friends] Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!
Randy
Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "nigger guys"? [the senators are somewhat shocked]
Senator 2
Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that "nigger guy" could become a slur that refers to all white people?
Senator 3
I'm certainly not a nigger guy. I've never thought a racist thought.
Senator 4
[black senator] Aw, come on, you're the biggest nigger guy in Washington.
Senator 1
Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill. [raises his left hand] All those in favor to ban the term "nigger guy"?
Most Senators
Aye!
Senator 1
Opposed?
Senator 4
[a lone black senator] Nay?
Senator 1
The motion is passed! [lowers the gavel.]
Outside the Senate building, supporters of the bill celebrate with confetti and streamers. Randy walks out and across the lawn with Richards and Fuhrman.
Randy
We did it!
Field Reporter
For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use.
Senator 3
From now on, if a person uses the word "nigger," it must be at least seven words away from the word "guy." [a group of black people is shown, not reacting in any way to the announcement. Everyone else continues cheering.]
Field Reporter
Tom, it appears that the nigger guy epidemic is ove- [two police officers come and take him away] Oh dammit I said it, didn't I?
Back at the community park Cartman and Mr. Nelson continue wrestling. Cartman has beat Mr. Nelson up pretty good and now has him pinned to the ground.
Mr. Nelson
AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay! [Cartman punches him in the face a few times] Okay, you win!
Cartman
Say "Uncle!"
Mr. Nelson
Ung-cle!
Cartman
Hahaha, now say "Carol Anne, don't go into the light!"
Mr. Nelson
Carol Anne, don't go into the light!
Cartman
Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical! [Mr. Nelson rises and pummels him in the back of the head. Cartman falls forward] Oh!
Mr. Nelson
There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size. [Cartman comes alive again and laughs] I have proven my point! My work here is done! [waddles away. The kids begin to disperse]
Stan
What was his point?
Kyle
I have no idea.
Stan
Dude, I don't get it.
Kyle
I don't get it either.
Stan
[comes to a certain realization] Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
Kyle
...Huh?
Stan
Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it! [smiles, then walks up to Token] Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
Token
Now you get it, Stan. [smiles]
Stan
[smiles] Yeah. I totally don't get it.
Token
Thanks, dude.
End of With Apologies to Jesse Jackson

Cartman Sucks
A scrapbook shot of Butters sleeping, with a poo mustache on his face.
Cartman
This picture I like to call "The Pierre". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha. [the caption reads "THE PIERRE 3/10/07." Cartman flips the page. The pages are artsy in design] And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth. [Yep, the tampon is in there like a thermometer] I call this picture "The Sleeping Menstrual". [the caption is shown, Cartman flips the page. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny stand around him, looking at the pictures. They're all in Cartman's room.] This one, I call "Hot Fudge Mondae". [caresses the picture] I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
Kyle
Is this all you brought us here to see?
Cartman
Oh no, there's much more. [flips the page] Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it "New Moon Rising". [a shot of Cartman hanging his ass over Butters' face] I did a whole study using my ass. [Cartman's ass over Butters' face from the left side] Here it is using some high-contrast stuff. [next, Cartman wearing darker pajamas, mooning Butters] trying out some... different light filters here. [last shot looks faded, with Cartman's ass directly on Butters' face.] But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
Kyle
Butters is staying over tonight?
Cartman
Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
Butters
[appears at Cartman's bedroom door] Hey, fellas! [Stan and Kenny turn around. Kyle looks over his left shoulder]
Cartman
Heh! [quickly puts away his scrapbook] Oh, oh hey, Butters! [turns around and greets him] I wasn't expecting you so soon.
Butters
Yeah. [puts down his sleeping bag] I finished my chores so I came over a little early. [Cartman takes the sleeping bag and sets it aside. Butters notices the other guys] Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
Cartman
[returns] No no, these guys were just leaving. [faces the other guys menacingly] weren't you guys?
Stan
Come on, let's go. [leads Kyle and Kenny out the door.]
Kyle
[stops] Wait, wai- I can't let this happen. [turns around] Butters.
Butters
Yeah Kyle?
Kyle
Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
Cartman
Kyyyle!
Butters
Uh what do you mean?
Kyle
I mean, that if-
Cartman
What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
Butters
Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.
Kyle
[angered] Hrrugh! [leaves]
Butters
So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
Cartman
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
Butters
But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
Cartman
Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
South Park, morning. The boys walk up to the bus stop. Cartman isn't with them.
Cartman
[off screen] You guys! I got it! [runs in and joins them] It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
Stan
What'cha do to Butters this time?
Cartman
It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! [cracks up at his own cleverness]
Kyle
Dude!
Cartman
I know I know, check it out, look. [the other three crowd in and look at the picture] I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
Stan
Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
Cartman
Because that makes Butters gay now!
Kyle
No dude, that makes you gay!
Cartman
Eh- ...what?
Kyle
You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
Cartman
[looks more closely at the picture] Nuh uh.
Kyle
Yeah huh!
Cartman
Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
Kenny
(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)
Cartman
But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
Stan
You are now.
Cartman
No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
Kyle
Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
Cartman
No, it was just for a second! [seeing that his plan has backfired, he puts the picture away] What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
Stan
You can't!
Kyle
Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
Cartman
How?
Kyle
The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
Cartman
[low voice] Really?
Kyle
Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
Cartman
[beat] ...Shit, I gotta find Butters! [runs off]
Kyle
[beat] ...Idiot.
Butters' bedroom, several minutes later. Butters is playing with his toys - a car, a truck, and a small action figure.
Butters
[singing] Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... [continues howling the tune]
Cartman
[enters the room] Butters.
Butters
[stops playing and gets up] Whoa, hey Eric.
Cartman
Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
Butters
[a little excited] A surprise? What is it?
Cartman
It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
Butters
[really excited] Oh boy!
Cartman
You ready?
Butters
Y-yeah!
Cartman
Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
Butters
[closes his eyes, opens his mouth, and gets on his knees] Oh, okay! [Cartman grabs a handkerchief from his back pocket and makes a blindfold from it, then puts it on Butters]
Cartman
Hang on a second here. [makes sure the blindfold is on snugly]
Butters
How come uh, I can't see?
Cartman
'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? [rushes off to get the toybox]
Butters
Oh uh, ho yeah.
Cartman
[under his breath] All right, that's good. [undoes his pants] Okay, open your mouth, Butters? [lowers them and ...] That's good, just like that.
Butters
[wary all of a sudden] Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
Cartman
...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. [lifts up his shirt to show his massive gut]
Butters
Well okay!
Cartman
All right, you ready? [grabs Butters' head and draws it closer to his own wiener] All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. [at that moment the door opens and Stephen enters.]
Stephen
Butters!
Cartman
Uh! [quickly gets dressed up]
Butters
Whoa! Hey Dad! [Cartman steps down from the toy-box and runs away]
Stephen
Butters! What are you doing?!
Butters
I'm getting a surprise! [points to his mouth]
Stephen
Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! [takes off the blindfold]
Butters
[looks around] Hey. Where'd Eric go?
Stephen
[quite concerned, on bended knee] Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?
Butters
Like what?
Stephen
Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.
Butters
What's... bi-curious?
Stephen
You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. [Linda appears at the doorway]
Linda
What's going on, you two?
Butters
Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. [smiles]
South Park Church, day. Butters and Stephen are in the rectory.
Stephen
Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.
Father Maxi
Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?
Butters
...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
Stephen
You see?
Father Maxi
Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you.
Butters
Really?
Stephen
What can I do, Father?
Father Maxi
There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured.
Stephen
A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.
Butters
Whoa boy! Camp!
Stan's living room. He, Kyle, and Kenny are playing a board game, Living. A door opens and closes, and Cartman appears.
Cartman
Haahaahahaha! [crosses his arms] Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
Kyle
What are you talking about, fatass?
Cartman
[uncrosses his arms] I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
Kyle
You figured that out, huh?
Cartman
[crosses his arms again as he turns away] That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. [pleased with himself]
Kyle
Except for us.
Cartman
Right, except for you.
Kyle
And all the people we tell.
Cartman
[turns around] Why would you tell anybody?
Stan
Because it's really, really funny.
Cartman
...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
Kyle
Like what?
Cartman
Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch. [grins, but Stan and Kyle ignore him] Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! [chuckles]
Stan
That isn't funny.
Cartman
[angrily] Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
Kyle
Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Cartman
Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys! [the other boys continue playing. Cartman changes tactics: he pleads] You guys, please don't tell anybody.
Kyle
Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
Cartman
Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle. [turns around and cackles] Haha, hahahaha! [leaves the house]
Camp New Grace entrance, night. Stephen pulls up with Butters, and some campers and camp staffers come out to greet them. Butters hops out of the passenger side, dressed in shirt and tie. Stephen goes to the trunk to bring out a suitcase.
Leader
Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters.
Campers
Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.
Stephen
[brings the suitcase to an elder staffer] Thank you so much for taking him in.
Director
Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.
Camp New Grace interior, night. The camp director is showing Butters around.
Director
Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?
Butters
Because I'm bi-curious?
Director
That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy. [they approach a room] Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy. [Room 22] Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life. [the door opens, and a boy is shown hanging from a noose in the middle of his room. The stool and book he stood on are fallen on the floor. The director quickly closes the door and continues the tour] Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there. [notices another boy in front of them] Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?
Bradley
Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6
Director
Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
Butters
I'm bi-curious.
Bradley
Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.
Director
That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed. [(a boy has hanged himself) whispers softly to a staffer as the staffer walks by] We've got another one: Room 22.
Staffer
Aw, darnit!
Community park, dusk. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are taking turns shooting the basketball at the hoop. Stan shoots and misses
Stan
Aw man, I've got H O R S now. [steps aside as Kenny receives the ball.]
Kyle
Okay, my turn. [Kenny gives him the ball and Kyle prepares to shoot. Cartman approaches the park behind him]
Cartman
Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
Kyle
[throws up the ball] Where's what?
Cartman
[grabs Kyle by the collar and shakes him violently] You know God damned well what!
Kyle
Let go of me.
Stan
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Cartman
I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone! [shakes Kyle again] What did you do with my picture?!
Kyle
Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture.
Cartman
[rolls up his sleeves] Give it back, Kyle!
Kyle
I don't have it.
Cartman
I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now, [puts up his fists as if to box] I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here.
Kyle
Shut up.
Cartman
You shut up! You're lying, and [points an accusing finger at Stan and Kenny] you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews! [Kyle punches him on the right arm once, firmly] OW! [puts his left hand over his right arm] OW! AAAAUH! [grimaces, turns around, and runs out of the park] NYAAAAAAAAAA!
Camp New Grace, chapel, day. Kids of every age are there singing in unison.
Campers
The Lord is love this for
With Jesus I can just say no
And not be confused anymore.

Director
We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you.
Butters
He's bi-curious too?
Director
Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!
Pastor Phillips
[flies onto the stage and prances about speaking flamboyantly] Helloooo campers! [twirls some and strikes a pose] Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man! [strikes a running pose] So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what? [jumps up into the air and does a 1080] It worrrrked! [strikes another pose, then eases up]
Director
That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip. [pulls on out of his back pocket] And just like a paper clip, [begins to mess with it] God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight. [presents the straightened paper clip. A Latino boy pulls out a gun, shoots himself through the temple, and goes down. Butters is startled. The director and Pastor Phillips just stand there.]
Park County Police Station, South Park Division, day.
Det. Yates
So you say you were robbed. [fills out a police report]
Cartman
Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski.
Det. Yates
If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?
Cartman
It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
Det. Yates
Okay, what is the picture of?
Cartman
[long pause] Why... why does that matter?
Det. Yates
Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?
Cartman
All right. It's a picture ...of me.
Det. Yates
Yes?
Cartman
It's a picture ...of me. [long pause] And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
Det. Yates
[long pause] You were sucking somebody's penis. [this grabs other officers' attention.]
Cartman
No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
Det. Yates
...I see.
Cartman
Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep.
Det. Yates
Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.
Cartman
I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
Det. Yates
Well then, you're screwed.
Camp New Grace, camp office. Butters and Bradley face the director and four staffers - one of them is a woman, another is Pastor Phillips
Director
You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?
Butters
Well sure, I guess.
Bradley
Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.
Director
And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?
Butters
Well yeah, sure.
Bradley
So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7.
Director
Then do you mind telling us why we found this [holds up a magazine with an aroused male model on one of its pages] 1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?
Bradley
That's... that's mine.
Director
You know this is strictly forbidden!
Butters
Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
Director
[rises from his chair and walks up to Butters] What's wrong?! [thrusts the magazine onto Butters' face] This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!
Butters
Yes, it's all very confusing!
Director
This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids! [a gunshot and body drop are heard off screen and all the adults present look to their right. The director sighs twice, rests his left elbow on his desk, holds his left hand up, drops his head onto it, and closes his eyes. The other staffers take notice. Bradley looks down, Butters looks down, then around] Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!
8:26 p.m., Cartman's room. Cartman sits at his desk looking distraught.
Cartman
That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now. [pounds his desk and gets determined] That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth. [grabs his ears and starts twisting them until they hurt] Ow. OW. OW!
The Cartman's kitchen, moments later. Liane balances her checkbook and pays off some bills at the breakfast table. Cartman enters the kitchen, puts his head against the wall and begins to cry.
Liane
[taking notice] Eric? What's the, what's the matter? [walks over to him to console him]
Cartman
[crying throughout] I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
Liane
Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.
Cartman
Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
Liane
Oh, now why would he do that?
Cartman
Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
Liane
What is the picture of, Eric? [Cartman stops crying]
Cartman
[sniffles] Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
Liane
Ohh, that's nice.
Cartman
But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. [turns his face to the wall and cries again]
Liane
Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.
Cartman
[looks at her and sobs] But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. [turns to her and cries into her chest]
Liane
It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.
Cartman
You, you will?
Butters and Bradley are in their room doing penance - writing Biblical verses at the table.
Butters
...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
Bradley
Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.
Butters
Awww, that's okay, Bradley.
Bradley
I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused.
Butters
Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
Bradley
You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great. [warm thoughts... Bradley panics and leaves his chair] Uh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!
Butters
Wuh-what's the matter?
Bradley
I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.
Butters
Well I like you too, Bradley.
Bradley
You do?
Butters
Well yeah!
Bradley
You like like me?
Butters
Sure, I like like you a lot lot. [laughs]
Bradley
Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves! [runs to the door and opens it, then runs out and away]
Butters
[gives chase, but isn't fast enough] No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
The Broflovski house, dinnertime. The Broflovskis are eating. The phone rings and Sheila gets up to answer it.
Sheila
Hello?
Liane
Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.
Sheila
Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.
Liane
Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.
Sheila
[long pause] Excuse me?
8:56 p.m., Cartman's room. Cartman is back at his desk fretting about the following day.
Liane
Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.
Cartman
It is? [happily jumps off his chair and runs to her] Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! [hugs her]
Liane
You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
Cartman
[his smile vanishes] What?
Liane
She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
Cartman
Mom, she's lying!
Liane
She said she was sure, Eric.
Cartman
Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
Liane
Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
Cartman
[thinks a moment] Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh.
Camp office, night. Butters is in there talking to the director.
Director
Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!
Butters
I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
Director
You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk.
Butters
Oh no, my Dad?
Director
Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you, you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?
Butters
Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
Director
We're fixing your confusion!
Stephen
There you are, Butters!
Director
Oheh- hey Dad.
Stephen
What's he done now?!
Director
Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!
A counselor
They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick! [Butters runs out, followed by Stephen, then the counselor, then the director]
A bridge similar to the one in "Fat Butt and Pancake Head", day. Bradley is near the middle of the span, hanging on to the side but ready to jump off. A crowd has gathered at one end of the bridge. The director arrives, followed by Pastor Phillips, Butters, and Stephen
Director
Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!
Bradley
Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!
Director
No no, we're fixing you!
South Park Elementary, next day. Cartman marches towards class with a slide projector. He turns left and enters the classroom
Mrs. Garrison's class. Cartman approaches Kyle
Cartman
Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone? [Kyle turns around and Cartman is in his face. Cartman softly says] Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
Mrs. Garrison
Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell. [writes the words on the board] Who'd like to go first? [Cartman holds down Kyles arm while raising his own and grunts]
Kyle
Ow! Quit it, dude!
Mrs. Garrison
Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first.
Cartman
HA! [gets up and goes to the board, pulls down the projector screen and clears his throat.] For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer. [clicks the projector on, and the class lights dim] This first picture I like to call "Moods of Winter" [a shot of snow-covered barren trees], a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
Kyle
[to Stan] He isn't actually going to show everyone...
Cartman
And now this next picture [clears his throat. Quick cut to]
The bridge near camp, day. Bradley is still hanging on.
Director
Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!
Bradley
It's too late.
Butters
[approaches the bridge] Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
Director
You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.
Bradley
I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!
Butters
You're perfectly normal, Bradley.
Director
Get back! You're just as confused as he is!
Butters
[gets angry] All right. All right that does it! [turns around and faces the crowd] I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was! [Bradley listens] You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
Bradley
Yeah.
Butters
I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! [Bradley thinks about this]
Bradley
I think. I think I'd like to come down now.
Director
He's coming down! [everyone begins to chatter] We did it! [stops by Bradley as Bradley climbs back onto the bridge's road] Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!
Stephen
Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.
Butters
No. I like bein' bi-curious.
Stephen
Well you know somethin'? So do I. [they both have a good laugh about it]
Butters
Wait. Now I am confused.
Mrs. Garrison's class. Cartman continues his presentation
Cartman
And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. [everyone gasps]
Bebe
Eww!
Clyde
[long pause] Dude.
Cartman
Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
Mrs. Garrison
Eric, what the hell is this?!
Cartman
What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
Mr. Mackey
[at the door] Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother? [reads the message] "Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk." She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? [walks away. Cartman stands there looking at the door, then at the class. Kyle has a look of pity for Cartman on his face and blinks]
Cartman
[longer pause] ...Lame.
End of Cartman Sucks

Lice Capades
South Park Elementary, morning. The bell rings and the fourth graders take their seats. Mrs. Garrison enters with her books and sets them on her desk.
Mrs. Garrison
All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.
Cartman
Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem. [points to Kyle, but blocks Kyle's view of his left hand with his right.] Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
Mrs. Garrison
No, I mean the problem of head lice. [a shot of the class] There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here.
Bebe
Somebody might have lice?
Class
Ewww!
Mrs. Garrison
So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.
Cartman
Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
Kenny
(What? Fuck you!)
Mrs. Garrison
I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice, we can stop it before it spreads. [the camera zooms in on Clyde, then on his hair...] Lice can live in anybody's hair. [...until the hair resembles a forest, with tiny houses built upon the individual hairs and a colony of lice walking around on the scalp below.]
Clyde's scalp. The camera follows one louse as he walks through this forest.
Male Louse
[approaching a female louse with a growing louse egg resting in a nest built on a shaft] Hello, Kelly. How's my babih?
Kelly
[sassily] You mean me or the little one?
Male Louse
I mean both.
Kelly
Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.
Male Louse
[holds onto one of the female's pincers] How did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you?
Kelly
Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis. [a group of lice tug on a hair nearby and pull it down. Travis and Kelly look on. He lets go and walks towards the fallen hair] You okay?
Travis
Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our babih is gonna grow up in. [turns around] I need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis. I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer. [turns away and walks off]
The gymnasium, later. The classes are lined up by grade level, with various screeners waiting at the heads of the lines.
Lead Screener
All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked. [The first students go behind the curtains. Craig takes off his hat and does the same]
Butters
Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
Stan
[looks to Kyle] What do you think happens if you do have it?
Cartman
[answering] They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. [Butters gasps]
Craig
[leaves the curtain and puts on his hat] I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! [walks past the rest of the class]
Cartman
This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
Kenny
(Hey! Fuck off!) [The screener waves Clyde forward and Clyde steps behind the curtain]
Lead Screener
Have a seat on the stool. [Clyde goes to the stool]
Clyde's scalp. The camera tracks Travis as he moves through the forest, but the scalp begins to shake and he stops. He turns around to see the hair part and a huge human eye pop up. They eye blinks, then he blinks, then the eye blinks again. Travis backs up a bit, then turns to run.
Behind the curtain. The screener has spotted the lice.
Lead Screener
Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em.
Clyde
What?
Lead Screener
You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?
Clyde
Oh my God. Oh Christ no!
Lead Screener
[writes a note and gives it to him] Now now, it's all right. We're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor.
Clyde
Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!
Lead Screener
I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.
Clyde
Yes they are!
Clyde's scalp. A group of lice surround the stump left from the fallen hair, including some older lice.
Travis
[approaching the group] Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem! [the other lice look at him] The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.
President
And what do you base this on?
Travis
[walks up to a hair and draws a human head on it] Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being. [the other lice look surprised] If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it.
Older Louse
Huh right, the world is conscious. It makes perfect sense. [kneels and knocks on the scalp several times] Hello. Anybody? [the other lice begin to laugh.]
Travis
If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!
Older Louse
Poodiggery and poppycock!
Travis
I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.
Older Louse
Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further.
Travis
[as security escorts him away] Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all!
A waiting room. Clyde and his mom sit with a man reading a magazine, and a girl with her mother. Clyde looks around
Clyde
This is so... embarrassing.
Girl
I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?
Clyde
I have... I have AIDS. [his mother looks at him, astonished]
Nurse
Clyde Harris? [Clyde goes in to see the doctor.]
Doctor
[writing out a prescription] Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there. Good thing they pulled you out of school.
Clyde
[desperate] But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!
Doctor
[walks up to Clyde] Well, believe it or not, some lice can actually attach themselves to flies, and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce. And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there.
Clyde
...Sick!
Doctor
This shampoo should take care of it. [hands him a bottle] Use this in the shower. Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but... it should kill... every last one of them.
Clyde's scalp. The lice go about their business, climbing up and down the hairs. Travis takes a break on a hair stump.
Kelly
Travis? Everything okay?
Travis
Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope.
Kelly
Hope?
Travis
Hope for a... chance at tomorrow? [water begins to drop down from on high]
Louse 1
It's raining? Now? [Other lice stop and notice. Turns out Clyde is taking a shower.]
Clyde's shower. He rinses himself off and then picks up the shampoo he was given: RID-X. KILLS INSTANTLY LICE & THEIR EGGS.
Clyde's scalp. The rain continues and the lice get used to it.
Louse 2
[starts dancing] Woohoo! I love the rain! [other lice join in the play. Travis doesn't have a good feeling about this]
Travis
Oh my God. [runs to Kelly and their egg] We have to get out of here!
Kelly
What it, it's just rain.
Travis
We have to get out of here now, Kellih! [grabs the egg and runs off with Kelly. Other lice continue dancing in the rain while still others watch. One or two look around and notice a green liquid spreading over the scalp.]
Louse 3
What is that? [walks up to the leading edge, reaches down and grabs a gob of it. The liquid quickly eats through his pincer and he screams in pain. The leading edge of the liquid moves past him and leaves him trapped in the liquid, which eats at him some more]
Lice
Whoa! [the liquid finally finishes him off. The other lice see the leading edge of the liquid get closer to them, and they run] Ruuun! [some of them get overtaken by the liquid, which is now moving quickly over the scalp. The camera follows them until it finds Travis]
Travis
Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly! [the lice that can, climb up the hairs while the others get swept up by the RID-X and killed]
Kelly
My God, Travis, they're all dying!
Travis
Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!
Louse 4
What the hell is it?!
Louse 5
Well it's okay, we're safe up here! [the hairs begin to sway back and forth as a strong wind begins to blow]
Travis
I don't think so! [lice begin to be pushed off the hairs]
Louse 4
[blown away] OoOhOOOoooh!
Clyde's bathroom. He's standing on a stool before the mirror blowing his hair dry.
Clyde's scalp. The wind keeps blowing lice off hair. Travis hangs on tight to the hair and to Kelly.
Kelly
Travis!
Travis
Kellih! Hang on!
Kelly
I can't... hang on!
Travis
You have to! For the babih! [Kelly's grip loosens. She tightens it, but the wind rips her from the pincer she was holding on with]
Kelly
Nooooooooooo!
Travis
Kehhhllihhhh! No! Noooo! [he's left alone on the hair with the egg, Hope]
Clyde's bathroom. He's done drying his hair and sets the hair dryer aside, steps off the stool, turns off the light, and leaves.
South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison's class. She's just come in with her books.
Mrs. Garrison
Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?
Cartman
Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
Mrs. Garrison
With what?
Craig
With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? [Clyde looks apprehensive, and Mrs. Garrison notices]
Mrs. Garrison
Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken.
Stan
Somebody in this class?
Mrs. Garrison
Uh, yes.
Class
Ohhhhh.
Cartman
Well who was it? [points to Kenny] It was Kenny, right?
Mrs. Garrison
That doesn't matter, it's over.
Cartman
Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who! [points to Kenny again] It was Kenny, wasn't it?
Red
I wanna know who it was, too.
Mrs. Garrison
It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!
Cartman
[pounds on his desk] That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
Class
Yeah!
Bebe
And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
Craig
How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
Butters
Yeah! Dumb girls!
Mrs. Garrison
The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history. [the camera zooms in on Clyde again] Ulysses S. Grant-
Clyde's scalp, the aftermath. Travis is asleep on the scalp, battered and bruised from the wind. He coughs himself awake and finds the egg with him, intact
Travis
Hope. Hope, you're alive. [he stands up to his full height and surveys the destruction all around him] My God... [a decomposed louse stands up and collapses on him] Heh?!
Louse 6
Help me... Help meeee... [it falls away and dies]
Louse 7
Travis. [Travis looks to his right] Over here! Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead.
Travis
How many survivors?
Louse 7
Just the six of us. And the Vice President.
Travis
[notices and throws the Vice President up against a hair] You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!
Louse 8
What do we do now?
Travis
[turns and faces the others] We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here. [the lice do as commanded]
Vice President
[the older louse] Who put you in charge?!
Travis
[turns around] God did! When he killed my wife! [turns back and walks away]
South Park Elementary, day, hallway. The fourth graders leave the classroom.
Cartman
All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! [Opposite Cartman are Jimmy, Tweek, Clyde, Anne, Bebe, Red. and two other kids. With Cartman are Craig, Token, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Kevin, Butters, and Wendy]
Craig
Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.
Cartman
Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
Kyle
You know what? I'll bet it was you!
Cartman
Me?!
Kyle
This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
Cartman
I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
Stan
You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
Cartman
That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. [Stan is stunned]
Kyle
Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
Cartman
And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! [Kenny makes an angry face]
Butters
[sensing where this is going] Heh hey guys, what would I do?
Bebe
Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
Kyle
It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
Clyde
Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
Cartman
There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! [turns left and walks away. Clyde looks around]
Kyle
It was him. It had to have been him!
Stan
Yeah... Or you. [they check out each other]
Clyde's scalp. More survivors are brought to the clearing
Louse 9
Mark? Mark, you have to hang on.
Travis
This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet.
Louse 8
How?
Travis
First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!
Louse 9
The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.
Travis
We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!
Louse 10
Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?
Travis
Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!
Louse 9
I'm not leaving my husband.
Louse 11
Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.
Travis
You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my babih. [turns around and walks away]
Louse 12
[redhead, runs up to him] I'll go with you. There's nothing left for me here.
Vice President
I wanna go too.
Travis
Not a chance.
Vice President
Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live.
Travis
If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you. [to the redhead and the Vice President] Let's go. [the redhead moves] Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President! [turns left and follows the redhead]
Vice President
[tarries] Yeah. Right behind you. [pulls out a gun and cocks it]
A storage room somewhere in school. Cartman is wearing a detective coat as other fourth grade boys enter the room
Cartman
All right, lock that door, Craig! [Craig goes to lock the door]
Kyle
What's this about, Cartman? [the boys are now seated on a bench against a wall]
Cartman
I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice. [whips out a little propane torch from his right pocket] We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties. [whips out a lighter from his left pocket, strikes the lighter on, and uses the lighter to light the torch. He puts the lighter away. Clyde is scared now.] Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
Jimmy
Ur ur re- ur really?
Kyle
That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
Cartman
[figuring out how to respond] This is a scientific test, designed to-
Kyle
You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
Cartman
I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
Kyle
Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
Cartman
If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
Craig
Yeah. That's true.
Jimmy
I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
Token
Yeah. Me neither.
Kyle
All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
Cartman
Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
The storage room, moments later. The boys have all given their 30 cc's in the labeled Petri dishes.
Cartman
All right, now everyone back over there! [the boys head back to the bench] We'll start with what I already know. [moves the heated coil tip over the blood sample. Only steam comes from it]
Butters
Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
Kyle
It doesn't prove anything!
Cartman
Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle! [takes Kyle's Petri dish and ...the same thing happens] Huh, I guess you're clean. [tries another Petri dish]
Clyde
Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.
Cartman
It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! [sticks the tip into the Petri dish, causing the blood to heat up and jump out of the dish. He gets the blood all over himself, and for good measure, tosses the rest of the blood onto himself.]
Token
What the hell?! [Clyde is scared shitless. Cartman turns the dish around to reveal the name: Kenny]
Cartman
Kenny!
Kyle
No way.
Craig
You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.
Cartman
Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! [silence for a second or two, then Kenny bolts for the door, pushing Craig aside, opening the door, and running down the hall]
Clyde's scalp. The survivors have made it to the hairline.
Louse 12
We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone. [a vast space of... nothing, like a desert] I've always heard stories about this place. Never thought it was real.
Travis
It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.
Vice President
So what exactly is your plan, Travis?
Travis
Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.
Louse 12
Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you.
Travis
Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name [closes his eyes] Kelly.
Louse 12
She was a lucky woman to have you.
Travis
Luck had nothin' to do with it. [a gunshot from behind kills the redhead, who wobbles forward, then back and to the ground. The Vice President keeps his gun trained on her corpse]
Vice President
[aims his gun at Travis] Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!
Travis
Why you murdering bastard!
Vice President
Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!
Travis
What the hell do you want, Vice President?!
Vice President
Walk! [Travis turns and walks, and the Vice President follows him, keeping the gun trained on him.]
Clyde's house, day. The doorbell rings and Clyde goes to answer it. Cartman, Craig, and a few others - Token and Jimmy - are outside with socks and bars of soap.
Craig
Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! [points to the sock in his right hand]
Clyde
What? What are you gonna do to him?
Cartman
He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen. [beat] Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! [they turn and head off]
Clyde
[his eyes wander as he thinks] You guys, wait. [the guys turn around]
Cartman
What, Clyde?
Clyde
I... nothing.
Cartman
All right, see you there! [the guys turn around and leave] Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
Token, Craig
Yeah!
Jimmy
Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up! [Clyde sees them leave, then backs up, scared]
Mrs. Garrison's house, day. Mrs. Garrison seems to be preparing an omelet for herself, adding garlic salt and putting it aside. The phone rings and she picks up.
Mrs. Garrison
Yello?
Clyde
Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.
Mrs. Garrison
What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!
Clyde
Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
Clyde's scalp, the hairline. The Vice President and Travis are still walking
Vice President
That's good! That's far enough! [Travis stops and turns]
Travis
What are you going to do?
Vice President
I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!
Travis
Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!
Vice President
It was a disaster! Disasters happen!
Travis
Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!
Vice President
Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis! [shoots out the knees of Travis's hind legs]
Travis
Damn you! Why?!
Vice President
Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not "conscious," we are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel this! [plugs six bullets into Clyde's scalp]
Clyde's neighborhood, day. He's walking towards the park.
Clyde
[feeling the little stings] Ow. [reaches back to the base of his skull]
Clyde's scalp, the hairline. The Vice President is about to finish Travis off
Vice President
You die he- [looks up. Two fingers reach down and grab him. He screams like he's never screamed before as Travis watches the fingers take him away.]
Clyde's neighborhood, day. Clyde glances at the louse and tosses it away. The Vice President screams to his death on the sidewalk below.
Clyde's scalp, the hairline. Travis tries to stand up, but ends up flat on his back. He can no longer move, so he just cries.
The neighborhood park. The boys have gathered on the basketball court to let Kenny have it.
Cartman
Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
Kenny
[restrained by Kevin and Bradley] (Not guilty!)
Cartman
Guilty! I thought so! [the boys pull down his hood and coat, and his shirt]
Craig
All right, let's do this!
Clyde
You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
Cartman
All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! [the boys gang up on Kenny and give him the sock bath]
Kenny
Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!
Clyde
Wait, wait!
Kyle
Wait... stop it, stop it! [he walks away; the others stop and look at him] I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
Craig
He had cooties and he lied about it!
Kyle
[looks over his left shoulder] Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?! [looks away] It was me.
Clyde
What?
Kyle
I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
Stan
Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice. [walks up to him] Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
Clyde
Wait a-wait a minute, what?
Cartman
Oh I get it. [walks up to Stan and Kyle] This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
Stan
You had head lice?
Cartman
Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
Mrs. Garrison
[offscreen] You all had head lice! [the boys look up and off to the left. Mrs. Garrison walks up to them on the court] Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!
Craig
I thought I was the only one.
Butters
Me too.
Cartman
But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! [the other boys join in the chant "Sock bath!" and gang up on Kenny once again]
Kenny
Dudes!
Clyde's hair. With the redhead and the Vice President gone, Travis is left alone with his thoughts.
Travis
Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our babih. But I let you down, babe. [blinks. A light shines on him and a vision of Kelly descends. Travis holds his left hand up as a visor to make sure he's not hallucinating] Keh... k-Kellih? [Kelly's apparition disappears, replaced by a fly. Travis climbs on to one of the fly's legs, and the fly takes off. After a long while, the fly alights on a new host and Travis drops to the ground, asleep. Members of a darker, buffer species of louse watch from the shadows. They prop him up and carry him away]
Louse 13
You are welcome here. [the colony here is well-developed, with entrances to dwellings going up several stories, making the hairs act as high-rise apartments. The residents there wave as he passes by] You're safe now. We've lived here for generation after generation, never being disturbed.
Travis
Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kellih! [at this point the camera pulls back, out of the hair, and out of the space between a pair of female legs. The camera pulls back enough to show an actress exiting her limousine.]
A photo opportunity. The actress has big lips.
Agent
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie! [photographers start snapping away with their cameras]
Angelina Jolie
Hello everyone! [scratches her groin through her dress] Hello!
End of Lice Capades

The Snuke
South Park Elementary, morning. The school bell rings and the kids rush in to sit down. Mrs. Garrison enters the classroom.
Mrs. Garrison
All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem.
Cartman
Uh oh! [Kyle's seat is empty, and he fears the worst]
Mrs. Garrison
Welcome to our class, Baahir.
Baahir
Thank you.
Cartman
Duhude, dude, [throws out his arms, palms out] not cool!
Mrs. Garrison
Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?
Baahir
Okay. [goes to Kyle's seat. Cartman begins crawling out of his, away from Baahir]
Cartman
Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
Mrs. Garrison
[stopping him. What follows is in hushed tones] Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!
Cartman
What's wrong? [looks at Baahir, who's looking back at him, then looks back at Mrs. Garrison and takes her aside] Has he been checked for bombs?
Mrs. Garrison
Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!
Cartman
No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
The school playground, recess. There are several kids waiting at the slide, Butters takes his turn.
Butters
[slides down gleefully] Now you go, Baahir. [Baahir climbs the ladder steps and slides down. Butters cheers him on. Cartman shows up and looks at them. Baahir dusts himself off. Cartman turns and walks away, then places a call on his cell phone]
Kyle's bedroom, day. Kyle is still in bed, his window curtains drawn shut. There's lots of little tissues on his bed and surrounding floor with two plates on the floor next to the bed. His cordless phone is on the covers. It rings, he picks up
Kyle
[sniffs - he has a stuffy nose] Yeah?
Cartman
[hushed] Kyle, are you on your computer?
Kyle
What? No, I'm sick. [sniffs]
Cartman
Get online. I need you to check something for me.
Kyle
Dude, leave me alone.
Cartman
Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
Kyle
[sits right up] What? Why?
Cartman
Get online now!
Kyle
All right, all right. [leaves his bed and goes to his computer, sits down and starts clicking]
Cartman
Go to MySpace. [enters the school building] See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
Kyle
[types a search term at MySpace] Baahir Hakeem. [Baahir's page pops up] Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
Cartman
[begins walking down the hallway] Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
Kyle
Over a hundred.
Cartman
[walks further along] Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
Kyle
White Stripes
Cartman
[stops suddenly] That's funny.
Kyle
What?
Cartman
He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
A ticking clock: 11:59:57... 11:59:58... 11:59:59... 12:00:00... Darkness. The following text appears onscreen, then disappears after Cartman finishes speaking.
Cartman
[voiceover] The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
South Park Police Station, day, Officer Barbrady's desk. A hovering camera looks at a ringing phone. Officer Barbrady answers.
Barbrady
Hello?
Cartman
[entering the boys' restroom, still in hushed tones] Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! [checks the toilet stalls on all fours]
Barbrady
From what? Who is this?
Cartman
I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
Barbrady
Are you serious?
Cartman
If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
Barbrady
Like what?
Cartman
Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
Barbrady
Oh jeez.
South Park Elementary, Mrs. Garrison's class, later. Mrs. Garrison moves on to History, but the school bell goes off as a fire drill.
Mrs. Garrison
What the hell?
Principal Victoria
[over the PA system] All students are to evacuate the school immediately! [Baahir looks around]
The front of South Park Elementary, later. The kids pour out happily.
Butters
Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
Baahir
Sure, okay. [12:02:32 pops up on screen and ticks the seconds away.]
Butters
Well all right! [they walk off together]
Kyle
Dude. [sniffs and calls Cartman. The LED readout vanishes]
Cartman
[exits the building through a side door and answers the call] Yeah. [walks among various trash cans and bins]
Kyle
Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
Cartman
Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
Kyle
I guess so.
Cartman
Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
Kyle
Wuh what doesn't follow?
Cartman
Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion. [starts running] Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
Kyle
Okay.
Cartman
Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
Kyle
[looks up the info as Cartman talks] Yeah. Actually, there is.
Cartman
[stops] What?
Kyle
There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally. [Cartman stays silent] Cartman? ...Cartman? [Cartman has turned off his phone and runs out of school]
Central Intelligence Agency, day. An agent takes a call and-
Agent
Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.
Head Agent
What? [takes the call] This is CIA head, Alan Thompson.
Cartman
Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
Mr. Thompson
What do you know?
Cartman
He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
Mr. Thompson
I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!
Cartman
I said I will only talk to the President!
Mr. Thompson
Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-
Cartman
LALALALALALALALA!
Mr. Thompson
I will have you arrested for-!
Cartman
LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
The Oval Office, 12:04:27 South Park time. The LED readout ticks away, the ominous echo follows.
Aide
Call is coming through now, Mr. President.
Bush
Hello?
Cartman
President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
Bush
Huh? Who.
Cartman
Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
Bush
Hildog?
A motorcade in South Park, day. The American flag waving from a pole on the hood indicates Secret Service protection.
Aide
Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know.
Hillary
What is it, Brian?
Brian
Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.
Hillary
Is the thread credible?
Brian
We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. [behind him, the rally gets closer and closer]
Hillary
No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly.
Driver
We've reached the rally site, Hildog.
The rally site, downtown South Park.
Aide 2
Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Hillary
Thank you, Chris. [leaves with Brian and a third aide. The driver walks off in the opposite direction, and Chris whips out a cell phone. He walks forward and calls someone]
Chris
They know about the bomb!
Blond Russian
That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight.
Chris
Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.
Blond Russian
That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston!
Chris
The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!
Blonde Russian
Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.
Chris
I understand, comrade.
Blonde Russian
Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.
12:17:56. Time keeps on ticking, ticking, ticking... Kyle is still at home, Cartman roams the rally.
Cartman
Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
Kyle
So then maybe you're wrong.
Cartman
Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
Kyle
Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
Cartman
Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
Kyle
Yeah. [Cartman giggles and sticks the phone down his pants, in front of his genitals. He takes the picture and sends it to Kyle. Kyle receives it on his computer] What is that?
Cartman
It's my balls! [laughs as Kyle just looks at the image]
Kyle
God damn it Cartman!
Cartman
[his laugh dies down, then] Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
Mayor McDaniels
People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! [the crowd cheers and holds up pro-Hillary signs: "Hildog", "In Hildog We Trust", "Hildog, we love you!", "Hildog #1 fan", "South Park Wants Hildog!!", "Hildog '08", "We Love You"]
Hillary
[affecting a Southern accent] It is so nice to be back in a small town like the one I came from. [more cheers for her]
Hildog Fan
Here we go! [his friends don dog-headed helmets and start barking.]
Brian
Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat? ["You know, when I start my life in office, quite a few changes have to be made!"]
Otis
We have the bomb-sniffing pig going through the crowd. If there is a bomb, the pig will find it. [the third aide has the pig on a leash, letting it roam as it will]
Hillary
This is why I campaign in small towns like these! Because it is in towns like South Park that you find the true America! [more cheers go up as aide and pig move around]
Aide 3
Oh my God, she got a scent! [the pig walks faster]
Brian
What?!
Aide 3
The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists have hidden a bomb!
Brian
[getting nervous] Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!
Aide 3
Come on, find it. Find! [the pig leads him up the steps to the stage]
Brian
My God, they hid it under the stage?!
Female Aide
No wait, look. [the pig approaches Hillary and really wants to get at that bomb]
Hillary
How much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on... uh... [the pig buries its snout in Hillary's ass] on the education of all- Woo haha, whoa there, girl. Haha, [puts some distance between herself and the pig, but the pig won't back off] uh, uh, on the education of all children. [the pig tries the groin this time] Oh, I declare!
Otis
Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...
CIA Headquarters. An agent comes up to Mr. Thompson with a report.
Agent
Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her...
Mr. Thompson
In her what?
Agent
In her snatch, sir.
Mr. Thompson
What?!
Back at the rally, later. Brian observes as two paramedics seat Hillary down on a gurney.
Hillary
What is goin' on? I wasn't finished.
Brian
Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing. [receives a call and answers it] Yes.
A CIA helicopter on its way to South Park, day.
Mr. Thompson
Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch.
Brian
A what?!
Mr. Thompson
A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina.
Brian
No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!
A diagram of a bomb inside a woman's uterus. Zoom out to reveal CIA headquarters
Mr. Waters
Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.
Back at the rally, later. Brian walks up to Hillary.
Hillary
What is goin' on, Brian?
Brian
Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.
Hillary
[fans herself in a Southern fashion] Oh my.
Brian
What do we do? Can we disable the timer?
Mr. Thompson
It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.
Brian
But then that means...
Mr. Thompson
Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever.
12:28:38 and counting. Four images come up: Hillary on the gurney, Kyle at his computer, Butters and Baahir playing checkers in Butters' living room, and the CIA landing in South Park
Mr. Thompson
Do we have that phone trace?
CIA Vice Head
[hands him the phone] The call is going through now, sir.
Cartman
[gets the call] Yeah? [walks through a parking lot]
Mr. Thompson
This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the- [he and his agents walk down the street. Two angles are shown of that, and a third image of Cartman walking through the lot]
Cartman
Yes, Mr. Thompson?
Mr. Thompson
Well, we've just arrived in your town.
Cartman
Why? Did you find something?
Mr. Thompson
Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.
Cartman
[stops] A snuke?
Mr. Thompson
That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.
Cartman
[walks again] I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
Mr. Thompson
We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop.
Cartman
Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. [the framing for the two scenes is removed to reveal the one image of Cartman standing next to the CIA agents. They look at each other]
Mr. Thompson
Oh, hey.
Kyle's room, day. Kyle is still at his computer when Stan walks in.
Stan
Dude, we totally got let out of school.
Kyle
I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for "Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
Stan
Russian?
Kyle
Yeah, this guy. [a YouTube profile page is shown] Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
Stan
So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
Kyle
No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
Stan
Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
Kyle
Oh that's a good idea. [does the search]
The Hakeem house, later. Police, SWAT, and CIA move in on the house and arrest Baahir's parents.
Mr. Hakeem
What is going on? What have we done?
Mr. Thompson
They claim they don't know anything about an attack.
Cartman
Big surprise!
Police Officer
Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere.
Mr. Thompson
Mr. Hakeem, where is your son?
Mr. Hakeem
We thought he was at school. He's not at school?
A clinic nearby. Hillary is up on stirrups while some police and agents look at an X-ray of her abdomen and groin.
Brian
You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.
Hillary
Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?
Brian
They'll find the detonator, Hildog.
Aide 3
We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?
EOD Leader
[part of the bomb squad] I'm not sending any of my men in there.
Chris
Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
Vladimir
Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running. [the detonator is shown with its LED readout: 12:34:10... 12:34:11... 12:34:12... 12:34:13... ]
An interrogation room. A CIA agent grills Mr. Hakeem, with a female agent as witness.
Agent 2
Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!
Mr. Hakeem
I tell you, I do not know.
Agent 2
[sighs, then leaves the room with the female agent and enters the adjoining control room, where Mr. Thompson is waiting] This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying.
Cartman
Let me have time with him.
Female Agent
What are you going to do?
Cartman
We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him! [removes his cap and goes in] You will tell me where your son is!
Mr. Hakeem
He should be at school! [Cartman walks off and brings back a stool, setting it against Mr. Hakeem's chair. He climbs up and stands on the stool, drops his pants, and starts farting.] Hey!
Cartman
[farts] Where is the detonator?!
Mr. Hakeem
Wuh-what detonator are you ta-
Cartman
[farts some more, and again, and again] I can do this aaall day.
Mr. Hakeem
[coughs] I don't know anything about a- [Cartman farts a short one, and then a long one that makes Mr. Hakeem turn away] Aawwwwgh [holds his breath, gasps for air and coughs] Stop it! Really!
Cartman
You can make it stop!
Mr. Hakeem
[almost weeps] I don't have the- [Cartman farts for a long time, and the female agent turns away from the one-way window]
Female Agent
Are we just gonna let this go on? [Cartman continues farting]
Kyle's room, later.
Kyle
Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
Stan
You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. [CIA agents enter the room quickly with their equipment]
CIA Vice Head
Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area. [Stan steps down for a better look at the activity]
Kyle
Hey.
CIA Vice Head
Donner, take over that station. [points to Kyle. Donner walks over and shoves Kyle off his chair]
Kyle
[stands up] What's going on?
CIA Vice Head
This apartment is being absorbed by Homeland Security!
Kyle
...Homeland Security?
CIA Vice Head
Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?!
FBI Leader
'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!
CIA Vice Head
I am!
FBI Leader
[more people come in] Yeah well not anymore you're not. This apartment has just been assigned to the FBI.
CIA Vice Head
That's outrageous! On whose orders?!
FBI Leader
On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!
ATF Leader
[more people come in] Not anymore you're not! Orders just came down from Central! They want ATF handling this on all fronts! All right people, from now on you're answering to me!
Secret Service Leader
[more people come in] Not anymore they're not! Orders from the President: he wants this handled by his staff personally! Now Nelson is in charge.
Nelson
[bursts into the scene] Not anymore I'm not! [everyone else falls silent]
The interrogation room, later. Cartman walks in with a metal suitcase containing syringes. He takes one out
Mr. Hakeem
What are you going to do to my wife?!
Cartman
Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
Mrs. Hakeem
We told you: we don't know.
Cartman
[whips around and shows them the syringe] Do you know what this is?! [they look at each other, unsure] This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. [injects himself with the syringe into the right arm and hops up on the stool next to Mrs. Hakeem]
Female Agent
Did he just inject himself with apple juice?
Cartman
Where is your son?!
Mr. Hakeem
She doesn't know either. [Cartman turns and drops his pants, and farts on Mrs. Hakeem's face]
Mrs. Hakeem
Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!
Mr. Hakeem
I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?! [a phone rings and the camera zooms in on Mrs. Hakeem's shirt pocket. Cartman turns and reaches into the pocket, pulling out the cell phone]
Cartman
Answer it! [holds the phone to Mrs. Hakeem's right ear]
Mrs. Hakeem
Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?
Cartman
Butters.
Mrs. Hakeem
Baahir, one of your classmates is keeping us hostage. [Cartman drops the phone and farts a good gust of flatulence against Mrs. Hakeem's face] Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! [Cartman drops off the stool and enters the control room.]
Mr. Hakeem
Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!
Cartman
We got him! I know where he is!
Female Agent
All right, where? We'll send our people in.
Cartman
No no, he's my lead. [opens the suitcase]
Mr. Thompson
You're not going alone.
Cartman
You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! [gives himself a double injection of apple juice]
Kyle's room, later. The Secret Service is running the show now.
CIA Leader 2
[white hair] All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com.
Kyle
Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
CIA Leader 2
Are you tellin' me how to do my job?
Kyle
Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
CIA Leader 2
Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!
Chase
Checking.
Stan
Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
Female Agent 2
[with a stack of papers] Sir, these kids are right. We've just received intel that Russian terrorists are believed to be responsible for the threat.
CIA Leader 2
Where's the intel from?
Female Agent 2
We just read it on Drudge Report.
Kyle
Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
CIA Leader 2
We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!
Kyle
[he and Stan look at each other] ...Not anymore you're not.
CIA Leader 2
Oh, snap. [walks off dejected]
Butters' living room, day. He and Baahir are playing Checkers, and Butters looks like he's winning.
Butters
[makes his move] Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. [outside, Cartman runs up to the window and crashes through it.]
Cartman
Uuugh! [lies motionless for a few seconds, then gets up]
Butters
Oh hey Eric.
Cartman
[walks up to Baahir and grabs him by the collar] Where is the detonator!
Baahir
The what?
Cartman
You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
Baahir
Leave me alone! [heads for the front door and walks out. Cartman follows him] Upta!
Butters
[watches them leave] Hey, I was about to win!
The sidewalk. Cartman chases Baahir down the street.
Cartman
Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! [A black van pulls up next to them and the side door slides open. Three real terrorists jump out and aim their semiautomatics at the two boys]
Terrorist #1
[olive-colored] Get in the van! [Both boys are scared, but Cartman backs away]
Cartman
Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
Terrorist #1
[they aim their guns at Cartman] Get in the van!
The clinic.
Aide 3
That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! Somebody is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually!
EOD Leader
No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic!
Brian
[overhearing it] I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.
The terrorists' hideout, 12:40:27 and counting. Vladimir has Cartman and Baahir tied up in chairs
Cartman
Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
Vladimir
You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!
Cartman
That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
Vladimir
[aims the semiautomatic at him] Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!
Cartman
Uhh yes, of course?
Vladimir
America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?
Cartman
The Russians?
Vladimir
Before that.
Cartman
The Germans?
Vladimir
Before that.
Cartman
The Germans again?
Vladimir
Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!
Cartman
You can't possible mean...?
The ocean blue. A fleet of British ships is sailing towards the United States, but these ships are from another era. The men are dressed in uniforms of the Revolutionary War era - as Red Coats
Captain
Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown! [gets a call and answers it on his cell phone] Yes, Your Majesty?
Queen Elizabeth II
The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail.
Captain
Full sail, Your Majesty?
12:43:57 and counting.
12:47:18 and Hillary is back on stirrups (upper left picture). 12:47:19 and Kyle is back at his computer (upper right picture). 12:47:20 and Cartman is shown struggling in his seat (lower right picture). 12:47:21 and the British fleet is shown (lower left picture).
The clinic. The aide, doctor, and other officials are behind protective glass in a booth. Brian is dressed in a Hazmat suit and gas mask
Aide 3
All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.
Brian
[diving in slowly, has radio communication with the booth] All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.
EOD Leader
God help him.
Aide 3
What do you see, Brian?
Brian
It's dark... cold...
Aide 3
You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz.
Brian
Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! [begins to cough]
Aide 3
You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there.
Brian
There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... [static fills the transmission and the aide tries to restore communication]
Aide 3
Say again, Brian.
Brian
[amid heavy static] There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!
EOD Leader
[takes control] Brian, get out of there!
Brian
Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!
EOD Leader
Brian? Brian, what's happening?
Brian
It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! [the camera zooms back to show his body gyrating helplessly, then being spit out by Mrs. Clinton's snizz]
Hillary
Hoh my!
Kyle's bedroom. He's at his computer as agents discuss things behind him.
Kyle
I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
Female Agent 2
The British?
Agent 4
Loyalist Red Coats!
Chase
Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!
Kyle
All right! MapQuest the address!
Chase
I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.
Kyle
Good thinking
CIA Leader 2
Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now.
The terrorists' hideout.
Vladimir
[warmly shakes a terrorist's hand] It was good knowing you, comrade.
Baahir
Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die.
Vladimir
Yes, but we will be rich.
Agent
[outside] Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go go go! [the doors to the hideout fly open and CIA agents pour in, with the CIA Vice Head supervising the riad]
Mr. Thompson
[last to enter, gun drawn] The game is over! Get down on the ground!
Vladimir
How did they find us?
Mr. Thompson
We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over!
Vladimir
It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes! [the camera quickly moves to the detonator: 12:56:57 and counting. Four seconds later the power is shut off] What the hell?!
Agent
The power went out!
Mr. Thompson
Well so then what time is it? [the power returns and the detonator's timer is reset to a blinking 12:00:00]
Vladimir
Oh crap.
Mr. Thompson
Take 'em down! [the agents fire away. One after one, terrorists go down, dead. Vladimir climbs a wooden ladder to the hideout's roof]
Vladimir
No! I don't want to die without being paid! [an agent shoots him down, he hits the floor and blows up. CIA agents remove the ropes from Cartman and Baahir]
Mr. Thompson
[places a call] The detonator is secured, general. You are cleared to proceed.
The ocean blue. The British fleet continues towards the United State. American jets fly over them and prepare to fire
Captain
The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!
Soldier
How?
Captain
Fire at will! [the soldiers quickly aim and fire. The bullets have no effect, as the jets simply unload their bombs on the ships and sink them.]
The Royal Palace, the Queen's throne room. She's seated at her throne and gets a call. She gets the phone from one of her servants
Queen Elizabeth II
Yes?
Captain
Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution.
Queen Elizabeth II
I see. [sets the phone down, takes a loaded gun to her mouth, and shoots her brains out. She falls forward and hits the ground, dead.]
South Park, at Long Road Shipping, the apparent hideout. Everyone stands in the street.
Mr. Thompson
[walking into view] Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again.
Kyle
Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
Cartman
Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
Baahir
Really?
Cartman
Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
Kyle
...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
Cartman
But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
Kyle
...Maybe. [looks away]
Cartman
Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
Kyle
...That is so missing the point.
Cartman
Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
Kyle
The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
Cartman
Yes or no, Kyle?!
Kyle
No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
Cartman
But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? [Baahir's parents approach, looking around at all the activity in front of their house]
Mr. Hakeem
Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country! [Mr. Hakeem nudges Baahir forward, and the family leaves]
Butters
Awwwww.
Cartman
Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh? [raises his own hand] That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
End of The Snuke


Fantastic Easter Special
The Marsh house, outside, night.
Randy
[inside] ...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
The Marsh house, dining room table. The Marshes are decorating Easter eggs. Stan dips a hard-boiled egg into a glass of green dye. Marvin spins his slowly in a small lathe. Randy finishes one up and shows it off.
Randy
Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. [sets it into the egg tray]
Stan
Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
Randy
Wha... what do you mean, "Why do we do this?" It's Easter!
Stan
Right, so, why do we color eggs? [Shelly makes a cross face]
Randy
Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
Stan
Yeah, but why?
Randy
Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.
Stan
So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
Randy
That's right.
Stan
You don't see the missteps in logic with that? [Randy is unfazed, while Shelly, Sharon, and Marvin look at Stan disapprovingly] Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
Randy
Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!
Stan
[leaves his seat] I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
Randy
What is wrong with him?!
Sharon
Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. [continues dying her egg. Randy slams his palms down on the table angrily. Sharon is taken aback.]
Randy
[rising] You know so little! [leaves]
South Park Mall, day. The Easter bunny has a big Easter display at the mall where he sits in a chair taking requests for Easter gifts. A line of kids is waiting. In that line are Stan, Clyde, Red, Kevin, Craig, Heidi, Millie, Bill, Token, Jimmy, and a few little brothers and sisters
Cartman
And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
Mall Bunny
Ahh, don't you think that's-
Cartman
Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
Aide
Smile! [takes a picture and Cartman hops off]
Cartman
Bye, Easter bunny! [leaves]
Mall Bunny
[watches him leave] Oh my God. [Stan walks up and sits on the bunny's lap. The bunny notices]
Stan
All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
Mall Bunny
Huh?
Stan
What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross? [no reply] It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times? [nudges him] Answer me!
Mall Bunny
Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume.
Stan
I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
Mall Bunny
Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid.
Stan
No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! [hops off and walks away]
Mall Bunny
I need a break. Can I have a break? [he gets it and walks up to some payphones nearby. He picks one up and dials a number] We have a problem. Somebody's onto us. Yeah, he's askin' a lot of questions. Only a matter of time before he finds out what Easter's really about. Yes, I understand what must be done. Call the others. [hangs up the phone]
Stan's neighborhood, day. Stan is walking home with determination. He walks by a bus stop where someone is reading a newspaper. The newspaper drops down a bit and the reader is another Easter bunny. Stan stops and looks over his shoulder and the newspaper rises to its former position again. Stan walks on, and the bunny rises a few seconds later to follow him. Stan notices and begins to run. A few seconds later he notices three more Easter bunnies facing him. With bunnies behind him and in front, he runs across the street to escape, but a car stops just before hitting him and two more bunnies step out of the car. He gets to the other side and continues running in the same direction as before, with the six bunnies chasing him. He makes it home and closes the front door behind him. The bunnies reach the door and start pounding on it
The Marsh house, inside. Stan runs upstairs.
Stan
Mom? Dad? [reaches the second floor] Anybody home?
Randy
[voice only] Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! [Stan runs to the restroom door and pounds on it]
Stan
Dad! You've gotta help me! [looks around]
Randy
Hang on, I'm taking a crap.
Stan
Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
Randy
What?
Stan
They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want! [hears the front door breaking open] They're coming in! Dad, open the door! [the bathroom door opens and Randy looks out, wearing some bunny ears and a bunny snout with buck teeth.] Dad?
Randy
We... need to talk, Stan. [the Easter bunnies run up the stairs] Ih, it's okay guys.
Gray Hare
Randy?
Randy
Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
Purple Hare
Ohhh.
Randy
Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
Stan's room. Randy explains things.
Randy
I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
Stan
Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
Randy
We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us. [turns to face him] We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
Stan
[not impressed, but curious] Does Mom know about this?
Randy
Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
Stan
I don't understand!
Randy
I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
Stan
Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
Randy
Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
Stan
So what is the secret of Easter?
Randy
I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
Randy's car, night. He and Stan drive along a secluded road. Stan has a bag over his head so he doesn't see where they're going.
Randy
I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
Stan
Grandpa's in it too?
Randy
Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
Stan
Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
Randy
You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
Stan
You mean the old Galveston Lodge? [Randy's taken aback at Stan's memory and so thinks about what to do next. After a while, he decides to remove the bag]
Randy
Dammit.
Galveston Lodge, night. Hares from all around gather inside. T.H.C.F.M. The lodge is guarded by two large golden hares
Hare 1
Hey Bill.
Hare 2
Evenin' Marcus.
Hare 3
Heh heh hey, look at you!
Hare 4
Hey everybody.
Galveston Lodge, inside. Hares mingle and chat
Hare 5
Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited.
Stan
Must I?
Marvin
There he is! There's my grandson!
Stan
Hi Grandpa.
Marvin
I'm proud of ya, Billy.
Stan
...Stan.
Galveston Lodge, induction ceremony. Randy places a strip of white fur on Stan's shoulders. The purple Hare dips an egg in a glass lavender dye and rings the bell. The gray Hare steps up, dips his egg in yellow dye and rings the bell. This continues. Later on, a gavel is sounded and the Hares turn left with lit candles.
Pink Hare
Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit.
Hares
Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
[two Hares carry the rabbit forward in a gilded cage]
Hippitus hoppitus reus Domine.
[they set the rabbit before the Pink Hare and everyone genuflects... except for Stan. Randy looks up and has him genuflect as well]

Pink Hare
All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!
Hares
Hail Snowball. [all rise as the Pink Hare approaches Stan]
Pink Hare
Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter?
Stan
Yeah.
Randy
Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
Stan
Yeah, I wanna know already.
Pink Hare
Very well. At the Last Supper, Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples. It was there that- [interrupted by breaking windows and ninjas pouring in]
Gray Hare
They found us! [the other Hares arm themselves]
White Hare
[with rainbow vest] Protect Snowball! [a door is turned down, and a ninja, a monk, and a layman enter the lodge. Another door breaks down and another monk enters with three ninjas]
Brown Hare
They're everywhere! [Hares and ninja battle each other, killing each other as Stan watches]
Randy
[approaches Stan with Snowball] Come on, we've gotta go! [a ninja spots him and quickly fires an arrow into his left leg. He stumbles] Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!
Stan
Where am I supposed to go?
Randy
Just get out of here! [Stan turns around and heads for the entrance. A ninja comes up behind him, but Randy grabs the ninjas leg and holds on, forcing the ninja to fall. The ninja tries to kick Randy off]
Layman
Where is the rabbit?!
Galveston Lodge, outside. Stan runs into a small woods nearby, but he hears car doors, so he goes back to see what's going on. The ninjas and laymen are rounding up the wounded Hares.
Hare 6
Where are you taking us?
Hare 7
No! I'm not goin' anywhere! [the layman walks up and shoot him in the head, and he falls.]
Stan
Jesus Christ! [a monk has Randy restrained]
Layman
Who did you give the rabbit to?! [slaps Randy, Randy spits back. The layman punches Randy in the stomach and has him rounded up with the others] Search the area! The boy could not have gotten far!
Stan
Oh no... [looks around, then runs off]
Kyle's house, night. Kyle is at the dining room table doing fingerpaints of Stars of David for Passover. The doorbell rings and he goes to answer it. Stan is at the entrance gasping for air and carrying Snowball. He's a bit unkempt.
Stan
Help.
Kyle
What happened?
Stan
My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
Kyle
...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
Stan
[enters anyway] Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me! [turns around and fires off a few questions] Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
Kyle
Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
A dark place. Randy is laying on the floor, the arrow removed from his leg. He stirs, coughs, and sits up. He's in an old large jail cell with the surviving Hares
Randy
Nelson. [crawls towards him] Nelson? Nelson, say something.
Nelson
[reclining against a cage wall] My legs. I... I think they're broken.
Randy
Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
Nelson
Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... [coughs. Randy lets go and crawls back, but sees someone standing before him]
Randy
You...
A mansion, night. Stan and Kyle arrive and knock on its front door. A butler answers the door
Kyle
Hi, we'd like to speak to a [reads the name from a slip of paper] Professor Teabag? [Stan is still carrying Snowball]
Butler
What is it in regard to? [the professor appears at the far end with a walking stick]
Kyle
The history of Easter.
Teabag
[walks slowly towards the boys] Sorry boys, it's a little late for me to be giving lectures. [turns around and walks away]
Stan
Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? [the professor stops and turns around]
Teabag
The Keepers? [walks towards them] The Guardians of the Secret?
Stan
[the butler steps aside] My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
Teabag
Come on in. [smiles]
Teabag's study. He leads the boys in and begins
Teabag
The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci. [on a large widescreen TV is a picture of The Last Supper] Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table?
Stan
Just bread...
Teabag
Really? Look to Jesus's right. [zooms in and pans to the lower left, then zooms in on an oval shape] The food which is a little different color than the others.
Kyle
It kind of looks like... an egg.
Teabag
Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of... [zooms out and a bright trace appears around the disciple behind the egg] Saint Peter.
Kyle
Who is Saint Peter?
Stan
He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
Teabag
Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit. [the boys say nothing for a few seconds]
Kyle
[flatly] Peter Rabbit.
Teabag
Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely.
Kyle
I don't see it.
Teabag
Look closelier. [zooms in]
Stan
He looks like a guy.
Teabag
Look more closelier. [zooms in further, and a pair of rabbit ears appear on Peter's head] With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it. [Peter disappears from the picture and a rabbit appears next to the egg which was in front of Peter] That... is Saint Peter. [Stan jumps a bit] The original Pope of Christianity.
Kyle
I don't believe it.
Teabag
Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat. [a picture of Benedict XVI appears] It makes no sense, except that it was originally designed... [a picture of a rabbit slides in next to that of the pope, and Teabag moves the hat from the pope to the rabbit] for a rabbit.
Stan
[looks at the professor] But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
Teabag
Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive.
Kyle
So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
The Vatican, night. Thunder and lightning roll through the sky. At St. Peter's Basilica, the Pope approaches one of the doors with a monk behind him. The Hare Club for Men is waiting to meet him
Pope Benedict
You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?
Randy
You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
Pope Benedict
Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!
Randy
It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
Layman
I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is!
Pope Benedict
The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!
Randy
I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
Layman
Take him to be tortured!
Pope Benedict
Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian.
Bill
[the layman] You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! [a cardinal and a ninja open the door, take Randy in, and escort him to his torture.]
Randy
No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!
Teabag's mansion. Stan and Kyle are still looking at the Last Supper. Stan turns around.
Stan
I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
Teabag
I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne. [the butler is shown polishing a steel vase as some ninjas make their way towards the study]
Butler
[notices some ninjas behind him] Mr. Teabag! Get out! [one of the ninjas runs his sword through the butler's head and out his face, killing him]
Stan
They found me!
Teabag
Boys, get out of here! [takes them to a window and opens it] Head to the woods! I'll try to buy you some time. [Stan and Kyle climb down the ladder he's prepared for them]
Bill
[off screen] Check upstairs! [the professor picks up a box of... PEEPS] Upstairs clear! Try the office! [Teabag takes the peeps to a microwave oven nearby and opens the oven's door. He puts the peeps in and sets the timer to 15 seconds. Behind him, two ninjas break into the study]
Ninja 1
In here! [Teabag closes his eyes]
Ninja 2
What's that? [the peeps begin to expand quickly and fill up the oven. Four seconds left, three, two, one...]
Ninja 1
PEEEEPS! [the oven explodes, spewing peeps everywhere and killing Teabag. Stan and Kyle are running away when they turn to see the whole mansion being destroyed by peep marshmallow]
Kyle
So what now?
Stan
If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
Kyle
You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
Stan
What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us! [softly] Wait... unless... maybe there is. [hands Snowball to Kyle] Here, hold this. [walks some distance away from Kyle and prays] Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. [waits for a long time, then peeks with his right eye, then with both, but there's no sign of Jesus. He opens his eyes wide, as normal, and looks up. Kyle looks down at Snowball]
Kyle
I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
A news special comes on: World News, Easter Vigil coverage.
Announcer
Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage.
Reporter
As Holy Saturday comes to an end, the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins. Thousand have turned out to hear the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection. [visitors whip out their cameras and take pictures] For this Easter vigil the Pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor, with a massive rabbit stew. [two chefs stand atop ladders next to a huge cauldron, slicing up ingredients. Bill and a ninja bring in a bunny to toss into the cauldron]
Violet Hare
NOOO! Noo! No, don't put m- [he's thrown in and is boiled to death] AAAAAAAAAAH!
Pope Benedict
Bill, this seems extreme.
Bill
The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.
Italian Cardinal
Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit!
Bill
Ya see? [the three leave to meet this boy]
St. Peter's Basilica. Stan and Kyle walk towards the alter with Snowball. Randy greets them as he's headed towards his torture
Randy
Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
Pope Benedict
Yes, hand it over!
Stan
First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
Pope Benedict
We promise.
Bill
We swear it, on the cross.
Randy
Just hand over the bunny, Stan!
Stan
Okay, fine. [a cardinal takes Snowball from Stan, and Randy is released]
Randy
[reaching his son] Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.
Stan
You said "hand over the bunny."
Randy
No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
Bill
Take them into custody! [ninjas come in and put cuffs on Randy and the boys]
Stan
Hey, what the hell!
Pope Benedict
Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need.
Bill
Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These "whores" must be punished in front of everyone!
Kyle
You swore on the cross, fatso!
Bill
Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! [cackles]
Randy
Oh, we should've seen that coming!
Pope Benedict
Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian.
Bill
It is what Christ would've wanted!
Jesus
[off-screen] Who are you to say that?! [the clerics look surprised. Jesus approaches them from the entrance of the basilica]
Pope Benedict
It... can't be.
Stan, Kyle
Jesus! [as Jesus walks, clergymen genuflect and bow to him]
Singer
He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!
Cardinal
Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq.
Jesus
I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.
Stan
Jesus, you did answer my prayer! [grins]
Jesus
Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.
Purple Hare 2
Ohh, that's me Neato!
Jesus
This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.
Bill
Kill him!
Pope Benedict
What?!
Bill
He goes against the Church. He must die!
Pope Benedict
All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian.
Bill
You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! [two ninjas apprehend Jesus]
Jesus
What are you doing?! [two others arrest Benedict]
Pope Benedict
I am the Pope!
Bill
You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord! [removes the papal tiara and places it on his own head] The Easter vigil will go on as planned! [walks to a clear spot with Snowball, so all could see.] Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!
Jesus
What is your problem, guy?!
Bill
Lock up those two Jews! [referring to Kyle and Jesus] We'll deal with them later.
Stan
No! No! [Stan and Randy are taken away in one direction, Kyle and Jesus in another, Benedict in still another]
Easter Vigil coverage continues.
Reporter
A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue
The platform outside St. Peter's, moments later. Bill presides over the rabbit stew.
Bill
My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! [the crowds cheer loudly]
Randy
No! Listen! We aren't rabbits! [a ninja punches him in the stomach] Oof.
A dungeon cell. Jesus and Kyle are in it. Jesus has a file in his right hand and is furiously sawing away at a chain by the cell's entrance. Across the hall from him is Benedict XVI in his own cell.
Pope Benedict
Forgive me, Jesus.
Jesus
We'll never get out in time to stop him!
Kyle
Don't you have any superpowers?
Jesus
[throws the file away] Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.
Kyle
What?
Jesus
Stab me with this. [brings out a small dagger] If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
Kyle
N-no way! Do it yourself.
Jesus
Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!
Kyle
Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
Jesus
Just make it quick. [kneels down and hands the dagger to Kyle] Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.
Kyle
[looks at the dagger in dismay] Don't make me do this.
Jesus
My son, there is no time! Do it!
Kyle
Eric Cartman can never know about this.
Jesus
I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter.
Kyle
Happy Easter, Jesus. [stabs Jesus in the neck, as ordered]
Jesus
Awgh! [walks around for a few seconds, groaning and shedding blood here and there. He falls forward and his halo rolls away with a metallic "clink"]
Kyle
...Jesus?
Back at the platform, Bill continues his speech.
Bill
Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit! [a cardinal holds Snowball over the cauldron]
Cardinal
Sorry, little bunny.
Stan
Snowball! [now dressed in rabbits ears and snout like Randy. A bright light appears near one of the obelisks in the center of the piazza, and Jesus' figure appears in the light. The light fades and Jesus is all alone. The crowd oohs and aahs]
Tourist
Jesus?
Jesus
Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent!
Bill
Why won't you go away?!
Jesus
One man cannot be the voice of the Church!
Bill
Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
Jesus
Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. [brings out a black and yellow glaive, then presses a button in the middle to release the blades, as in a switchblade. He throws it towards Bill, who runs from it. It levels off and slices through Bill's midsection and returns to Jesus. Jesus strikes a pose and catches it with his right hand. The blades disappear into their sheaths. Jesus brings out some sunglasses with his left hand and puts them on, still maintaining the dramatic pose.]
Crowd
YAAAY!
Stan
All right Jesus!
St. Peter's Basilica, day. The sun is bright and the sky is blue, the basilica is decked out with streamers and Easter wreaths. White smoke rises above and behind the basilica, indicating a new pope
Crowd
Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.

Cardinal
Your Holiness, what should we tell the world about how to run their lives? [Snowball now sits on the papal throne. Snowball, having no human vocal cords, says nothing] It isn't saying anything.
Italian Cardinal
Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.
Randy
Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
Stan
Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
Randy
That's my boy.
Crowd
[in the background] In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.

End of Fantastic Easter Special

D-Yikes!
South Park Elementary, Friday during the day, Mrs. Garrison's class. The kids enter the classroom
Mrs. Garrison
[enters and drops her books on her desk in anger] Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up! God damn it! [some papers flutter off the top of the stack. She turns and erases some addition problems she had up on the blackboard earlier] Stupid ass man! They're all the same! [Stan crosses his arms and buries his head in them. He's the only student to do so]
Kyle
Oh God, here we go again.
Mrs. Garrison
All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, "Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'?" I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!
Stan
Uh oh, this isn't good.
Mrs. Garrison
[gets into Stan's face] Did I say something to you, sugartits?!
Stan
[frightened] No ma'am.
Mrs. Garrison
[heads back to the blackboard] You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, "The Old Man and the Sea"!
Cartman
Have you lost your mind?
Stan
Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
Mrs. Garrison
Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!
Butters
But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
Mrs. Garrison
If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!
South Park Elementary, after school, outside. The students exit and head home.
Stan
Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
Kyle
Our whole weekend is shot.
Kenny
(What the hell are we going to do?!)
Cartman
You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
Stan
We don't?
Cartman
No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
Moovit Truck Rental, in the industrial section of South Park, Friday afternoon. A group of Mexican day laborers stand around waiting for work. Cartman and friends approach them. And Cartman whistles
Cartman
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
Laborer 1

Laborer 2

Cartman

Stan
Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
Cartman
Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
Curves, a fitness and weight loss center, day. Mrs. Garrison is running hard on a treadmill, taking out her frustrations.
Mrs. Garrison
They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are! [a woman walks up and gets on the treadmill to her right]
Woman
Are you okay, hon?
Mrs. Garrison
I just hate men is all. It's like all they care about is how hot you look!
Woman
Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.
Mrs. Garrison
Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage.
Woman
I'm Allyson.
Mrs. Garrison
Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.
Allyson
No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman.
Janet
Yeah, I've been told that.
Allyson
How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar?
Janet
Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.
Allyson
Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called "Lebow".
Les Bos, night, 13280. "Lebow" is the French pronunciation of Les Bos. Allyson and Janet approach the front door. Allyson leads Janet in.
Allyson
Hi Linda, hi Kate.
Woman 2
Hey Allyson.
Woman 3
Who's the new girl?
Woman 2
Allyson always goes for the butch ones.
Allyson
[approaches the bar with Janet] Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy?
Janet
Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.
Allyson
Yeah. Well, most of the girls here have done each other. [gets a glass and a beer and pours the beer into the glass.]
Janet
He-yeah. Done what?
Allyson
You know. [smiles] Had sex. [passes the beer to Janet and orders a second beer for herself.]
Janet
[looks around] Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?
Allyson
Yeah. I... thought you understood that.
Janet
Oh jeez. [fans herself]
Allyson
I'm sorry. I thought you knew what "girl bar" meant.
Janet
But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa. [moves away]
Les Bos, bathroom. Janet is washing her face.
Allyson
Janet, I'm really sorry. It's just that at the gym you said you didn't like being with men, so I thought you were a-
Janet
I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!
Allyson
Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman?
Janet
Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda [demonstrates with her fingers] scissor or something.
Allyson
There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet.
Janet
I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.
Allyson
Could I... maybe kiss you? [gets close, but Janet turns and walks away]
Janet
Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!
Allyson
Is it wrong, Janet? Let your inhibitions go. Let's just have fun tonight. [they hold hands] No commitments. [Allyson lets go] Just fun. [she grabs her hand and they close in for the kiss]
Janet's bedroom, later. Janet and Allyson are going at it in bed.
Janet
Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!
Allyson
Janet, you're crazy!
Janet
Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!
South Park, Monday, just before dawn. The boys walk over to Moovit Trucking to meet up with the laborers and get their finished essays.
Kyle
They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
Cartman
They'll be done. [whistles to get the laborers' attention.] ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? [the laborers approach] All right, did you read the book?
Laborers
Sí, sí.
Kyle
What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
Laborer 1
Eet starts there the old man, and his job is to catch the feesh, so he get in the boht, to try and catch feesh.
Laborer 2
Saw he catch the feesh, but the feesh is very strong, so the old man, cannot reel in the feesh.
Laborer 5
So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh.
Kyle
He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
Laborer 1
No, because on the way home, the sharks come and eat the feesh. And so, he no make money. [all five laborers take off their hats and put them against their chests in mourning]
Stan
That's it, that's the whole story?
Laborer 1
Sí.
Cartman
All right, did you write the four essays?
Laborer 1
Sí, we all wrote essays for you. [the laborers put their caps back on]
The Boys
[all thumbs up] All right!
Cartman
Okay, let's have 'em.
Laborer 4
Have what?
Kyle
You said you all wrote essays.
Laborer 1
Well, my ese lives in Miami. I wrote to him like you said, but I don't think he got the letter yet.
Laborer 2
I wrote my ese in Albuquerque.
Laborer 5
I wrote three eses: my ese back home, my ese in Denver, and my ese in Glenwood even wrote me back. "Thanks for writing me, ese." [the boys are stunned]
Kenny
(Uh oh...)
Kyle
Dude, we're totally fucked now!
Cartman
Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
Laborer 1
We thought it was kind of strange.
Kyle
This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
Stan
You guys, school starts in ten minutes!
Kyle
Son of a bitch! [the boys turn and head for school]
South Park Elementary, Monday morning, Mrs. Garrison's class. The kids enter the classroom
Stan
[sees Clyde] Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde! [Clyde turns around] You didn't finish your essay either, right?
Clyde
No, I got it done. [turns and walks to his desk. Jimmy walks up beside the boys]
Kyle
Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
Jimmy
Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. [walks off, leaving the boys dumbfounded]
Cartman
Crap! [the boys head for their seats]
Kyle
We're dead.
Mrs. Garrison
[dances into the room and sings] Hello, class. Here's my little desk [strokes it gently], my nice lil chalkboard. [hugs it. The boys are surprised at her behavior]
Cartman
Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
Mrs. Garrison
[acting bashful] Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so.
Kyle
[looks at Cartman, then at Stan. Stan looks back at both of them] Really?
Mrs. Garrison
Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking. [sighs] I'm gay. [silence follows]
Stan
Again?
Mrs. Garrison
[sits on the edge of her desk, right leg over left] It was a shock to me too. I... met another woman and... we went to this fabulous bar called "Les Bos" where I finally felt at home. Allyson and I talked, and really opened up to each other and... then we... [demonstrates] scissored all night long.
Butters
You have to be careful with scissors.
Mrs. Garrison
But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right? [closes her eyes] Oh I'm so happy.
Cartman
That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
Class
Yay!
Mrs. Garrison
[blushing and hides behind her hands] Teeheeheehee.
Les Bos, night. Janet goes to the bar alone.
Janet
[now confident] Hey Tracy, hey Kate.
Tracy
Hi Janet.
Janet
Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? [moves away]
Linda
[Woman 2] Huh?
Janet
Hey Patty.
Patty
What's up, Janet.
Janet
[lights a cigarette] Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.
Big Woman
Hey Janet, why don't you pick up on your own girl? [Janet flicks the cigarette away and leaves her seat, comes up behind the big woman and pulls her down on her stool to the ground and starts punching her.]
Janet
Oh yeah, dyke fight! [they roll around on the floor and the big woman gets away. The other women gather to watch. the big woman lands a kick to Janet's groin] You kicked me right in the pussy! [the fight resumes and they tumble into a booth, fighting all the way to the floor again. The big woman fights Janet off, but Janet gets turned on and starts having sex...] Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! [the big woman, distracted for a moment, goes back to attacking Janet.]
Lesbian 4
You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news.
Lesbian 5
What is it, Katie?
Katie
They're closing down the bar. For good!
Linda
Closing it down? They can't do that.
Lesbian 6
[blonde] This is our home.
Janet
Yeah, this is our home.
Katie
Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians.
Janet
Persians?!
Tracy
So where are we supposed to go?
Janet
We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!
City Hall, the Mayor's Office, day. Janet and the other lesbians are in the office.
Janet
Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!
Mayor McDaniels
You're a lesbian now?
Janet
That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!
Mayor McDaniels
The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.
Janet
Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!
Lesbians
Yeah, that's right!
Mayor McDaniels
I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.
Janet
[approaches the desk] Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!
Mayor McDaniels
Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.
Les Bos, later. The lesbians gather there for one last time.
Tracy
Well, here's to some great times at this place.
Lesbian 7
Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out.
Janet
Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!
Allyson
Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?
Janet
We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them "We aren't leaving Les Bos."
Katie
Actually, it's "Lebow".
Janet
[faces Katie with a ready fist to be pumped] No, it's Les Bos! [addressing all the lesbians] We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!
Linda
[coming into view] The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.
Emir
Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar.
Lesbian 6
Yes, we are.
Emir
Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods.
Janet
I knew it! I knew it!
Emir
But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.
Janet
Would you allow straight people in? Men?
Emir
Well... we would allow whoev-
Janet
Choose your next words wisely, Persian! [jabs a finger into Emir's chest. Emir backs away]
Emir
Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy.
Janet
No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! [kicks him in the groin and walks away]
Emir
Ohhhhh!
Persian
How dare you! [Janet is shown in slow motion, her hips swaying back and forth]
Narrator
And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. [Emir throws up on the floor]. All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff.
Anchor
As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in.
Lesbian 8
Good for them!
Lesbian 9
You go girls! [she takes a chip and bites into it. The bite is shown in slow motion.]
Narrator
The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.
Persian 2
Well fine. If they're going to block the entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us! I'll call more Persians for help. [turns left and picks up a phone in slow mo, then a fast-forward to dialing the numbers. The dialing is shown in slow motion. Next shot is Les Bos under a sepia sky]
Narrator
The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering.
Lesbian 6
Here they come. [the Persians approach, but stop short]
Big Woman
There's so many of them.
Janet
Lesbos! Positions! [they all take a battle stance]
Persian 2
Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it!
Janet
The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!
Persian 2
All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu!
Persians
[charging forward] Huuu! [slow motion feet are shown]
Janet
Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight! [the battle begins with both sides pushing, the line going back and forth] Don't give them an inch! [she gets poked somewhere] Ow! Iranian faggot!
Persian 2
Come on, seriously, let us in!
Janet
Never!
Narrator
For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating. [Janet and the second Persian are shown in intense shoving combat] Finally the Persians grew tired. and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses. They retreated. [and threw down their weapons] The Lesbos... had held.
Janet
Lesbohhhs!
Lesbians
Huok! Huok!
Narrator
The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.
Persian 2
[turns around] Here he comes. [the others turn to see. An opulent Hummer draws closer and closer]
Narrator
Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool. [four men pour out of the Hummer and arrange themselves into steps in front of the grille]
Persian 2
Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate.
Xerxes
[deep voice] Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle.
Narrator
And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.
Xerxes
I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.
Les Bos, the aftermath of the Battle of South Park. The improvised weapons are strewn all over the street.
Janet
Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.
Allyson
Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives.
Janet
We can't? I think it's pretty fun.
Linda
We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
Lesbian 10
[WNBA player] Maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner.
Janet
Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.
Allyson
Whattaya mean?
Janet
If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!
Allyson
But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians.
Janet
It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
Moovit Trucking, day. Janet shows up with Women 6 and 8 and whistles at the laborers.
Janet
¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
Laborer 1
Yeis.
Laborer 2
We looking work, sí.
Janet
All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
Laborer 2
Okay.
Laborer 1
Sure.
Laborer 3
[wearing NY baseball cap] Okay.
Laborer 4
[wearing gray baseball cap] Yeah.
Allyson
Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian.
Janet
Sure they do. [walks over to one of the laborers, Laborer 1, and works on him] Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne. [shields her eyes from the cologne, then presents the new man] Persian.
Laborer 1
Sí. [the two women smile]
Lesbian 6
Wow!
Janet
All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.
Laborer 1
Okay.
Laborer 5
No problem.
Laborer 2
Yes.
Laborer 4
Sí. [they turn around and walk away]
Janet
And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.
Les Bos, stormy sky, day. The camera pans down from the sky.
Narrator
A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee. [Janet turns around (fast motion) and heads to the kitchen (slow motion). She enters the kitchen (fast motion) and grabs the glass kettle from the coffee maker (slow motion). She turns towards the sink (fast motion), and pours water into the kettle (slow motion). She turns back to the coffee maker (fast motion) and pour the water into it (slow motion). She closes the water cover, opens the coffee cover, gets some coffee, returns (all fast motion), and pours the coffee into the coffee filter (slow motion). She closes the coffee cover (fast motion) and presses the on button (slow motion).] With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough?
Lesbian 6
[standing on a booth bench and looking out a window] The Persians are attacking again!
Janet
Take positions, Lesbos!
Lesbian 11
Get outside! [the lesbians begin to move towards the door]
Janet
No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.
Linda
Really?
Allyson
How can you tell?
Janet
Let them through. It's okay.
Laborer 3
Hola, ¿como estas?
Laborer 4
Hola.
Janet
Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?
Laborer 4
Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal.
Janet
A-are you sure?
Laborer 1
No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge.
Janet
What secret?! [Laborer 4 hands him some photos] Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?
Laborers
Sí.
Allyson
Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone.
Janet
It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.
Les Bos, outside, moments later. Xerxes descends from his throne as Janet approaches
Xerxes
Why are you lesbians being so difficult?
Janet
Because we're protecting the only home we have.
Xerxes
I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.
Janet
You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.
Xerxes
Okay, how about this? [stands behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders] I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money.
Janet
That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you. [takes Xerxes' left hand and sniffs it] I know you're actually a woman.
Xerxes
[lets go and backs away quickly] How..? How did you find that out?
Janet
I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.
Xerxes
You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.
Janet
Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking. [Xerxes wasn't expecting this response] But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!
Xerxes
You do? Seriously?
Janet
Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?
Xerxes
No. I don't even know how two women... can make love. Unless they just kind of [demonstrates with her fingers] scissor or something.
Janet's bedroom, later. Janet and Xerxes are going at it in bed.
Janet
Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!
Xerxes
Ohh, that feels so supercool!
Janet
Yeah, scissor!
Xerxes
Ohh, I'm a new woman!
Les Bos, next day. A bright blue sky and fluffy clouds grace it.
Narrator
And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.
Janet
Thanks for everything, Xerxes.
Xerxes
No. Thank you, friend.
Allyson
Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?
Janet
The school hired a substitute to cover for me.
South Park Elementary, morning, Mrs. Garrison's class. The kids are quietly paying attention
Laborer 1
Hand so to find the sum of the two fractions, zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator. [the five laborers the boys first hired are there]
Laborer 2
Sí.
Laborers
Sí. Sí. Yes. Yes. That's right.
Laborer 4
Sí.
Stan
These guys are pretty good.
Kyle
Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. [both boys resume taking notes.]
End of D-Yikes!

Night of the Living Homeless
The neighborhood, day. The boys head for the park.
Cartman
All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
Kyle
Fine.
Stan
[stops] Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people? [all around the basketball court homeless people loiter or sleep. There's one bum sleeping at center court. The boys walk up to him] Sir, could you move a little, please?
Bum
Spare some change?
Cartman
[pinches his nose shut] Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house. [releases the pinch] Get out of here!
Kyle
You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go. [a slow pan of the homeless around them] They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
Stan
Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
Kenny
(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)
Cartman
No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
Kyle
Really?
Cartman
Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
Moments later, kids from around the neighborhood gather in the basketball court.
Butters
[through a bullhorn] Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. [Stan and Kenny prepare the ramp at center court for Cartman]
Cartman
Thank you, thank you. [to Stan and Kenny] The ramp ready?
Stan
Yeah, it's all set.
Clyde
He won't make it.
Kyle
Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
Cartman
All right, here we go! Jimmy? [Jimmy starts the drum roll. Cartman takes off and picks up speed on his way to the ramp. Tweek and Bebe have their fists ready to pump for him. He leaves the ramp successfully, only to land on the bum and hit the ground without injury]
Bum
Oh! Aww.
Cartman
[jumps off his skateboard] Yes! I did it! [tosses his helmet away] I jumped over the homeless! [turns around] Yes!
Kenny
(Yehes!)
Stan
That was a sweet idea, Kyle. [smiles]
Kyle
God damn it, that wasn't my idea!
South Park City Hall, day, the City Council. The Mayor is presiding and her two aides stand behind her
Mayor McDaniels
All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? [silence for a few seconds]
Fire Chief
Well, I, I short of had an idea.
Mayor McDaniels
Please, Mr. Valmer.
Mr. Valmer
[the fire chief] We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at.
Other Members
Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it.
Randy
Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
Mr. Valmer
Ohh, that's a good one.
Mr. Mackey
Nice one, Randy.
Gerald
Like it.
Aide
That's like recycling.
Mrs. Testaburger
All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!
Randy
You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.
Homeless Advisor
Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more.
Kyle's house, a rainy night. Kyle looks out from a window on the second floor and sees a homeless man on the sidewalk. The man carries a used tin can with his right hand and a small "SPARE CHANGE?" cardboard sign with his left hand. A car passes by and honks. Kyle takes pity on him and comes downstairs. He opens the front door, exits, and walks up to the man.
Kyle
Hi. I've uh... [the man faces him] I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this. [hands him a bill] It's twenty dollars. [drops it into the tin can and backs up, smiling]
Bum
Got any more?
Kyle
[frowns] No, that... I thought that was a lot.
Bum
[turns around and walks off a bit, asking no one in particular] Spare any change?
Kyle
[sad at the lack of gratitude] You're welcome. [walks back into the house with his head down]
South Park, morning. Kyle climbs onto his toy box and looks out the window again. More homeless people have arrived and are camped out in front of the house.
Kyle
Oh crap. [the doorbell rings and Kyle comes down to answer it. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman enter]
Stan
Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
Kyle
I don't know.
Cartman
There's a bunch outside my house too.
Bum
[female] Spare any change, sir?
Cartman
No! Fuck off! [slams the door shut]
Stan
I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
Kyle
He did?
Cartman
Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
Kyle
Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
Cartman
You what?!
Kyle
Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
Stan
Kyle, what were you thinking?
Cartman
[makes his way to Kyle] Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
Kyle
I don't want you to jump them, retard!
South Park, commercial district, day. Randy walks along Main Street, not really paying attention...
Bum 1
Spare some change?
Randy
No, sorry, I don't have any change.
Bum 2
[a few stores down] Got any change?
Randy
No, sorry. [the bum follows him until he passes the third bum]
Bum 3
Can you spare some change? [Randy looks back and runs into the fourth bum]
Bum 4
[holds out his cup] Chaaange?
Randy
Huh! I don't have any change. [more bums come out of the woodwork and crowd in on him]
Bum 5
[an elderly woman] Change?
Randy
No!
Bum 6
Change? [Randy runs across the street, but...]
Bum 7
Spare some change?
Randy
[shielding himself with his suitcase] Leave me alone I don't have any change!
Bum 7
All right, God bless you, sir.
Randy
Oh, now I feel bad. [goes back to the bum] Here! [tosses some change into the cup] Ahh! [the other bums reach the other side of the street] Hahh! [begins to run, but other homeless people appear, asking for change. Randy moves past them] Nono, that was really all the change I had.
Bum 7
[jumps into view again] Spare some change?
Randy
I just gave you change!
Bum 8
[another old woman] Change? [the homeless crowd Randy in and he can't escape. Their pleading takes on a chanting quality: "Change? Change? Change? Spare some change? God bless. ..."]
Randy
Wahhh! I don't have any more change! [makes his way through the crown of bums] Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! [disappears under the sea of homeless people]
The South Park Community Center, day. Gerald, Jimbo, and the Stotches are present.
Gerald
Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
Randy
[outside] Waaah! [bangs on the doors] Awwww! [enters, shuts the door behind him, and locks it] Stay away! [implores and pounds on the door] Stay awayhay!
Jimbo
Randy? Randy, what happened?
Randy
Stay awa- ...I don't have any change! [collapses on the floor against the door] I don't have any chaaaahahange!
A splash screen comes up for News 5.
Announcer
This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs.
Chris Swollenballs
South Park has become overrun with the homeless. [a shot of the homeless crowd in front of South Park Elementary, then another shot of them in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty] Nearly every square inch of public property is now riddled with homeless, shutting down roadways and making getting around impossible. [a portrait of a homeless woman] Many people are trapped throughout the town. [an aerial shot of the community center. The center is surrounded by homeless people, with the five adults inside it now on the roof]
Randy
Help! Help us!
Kyle's house, living room. The boys watch the breaking news on TV
Stan
Dude, it's our dads.
Kyle
Oh my God.
Chris Swollenballs
In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change.
Bum 9
[appears behind him in the newsroom] Spare some change?
Chris Swollenballs
What the? You can't be in here.
Bum 9
Ya got any change, sir?
Chris Swollenballs
No I don't have any change. How did he get in here?
Bum 10
Chaaaaange?
Chris Swollenballs
No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any- [a PLEASE STAND BY screen pops up and the station goes off the air]
Cartman
You see what you did, Kyle?!
Stan
Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. [the boys turn off the TV and head outside]
Kyle's house, outside.
Cartman
They're everywhere!
Aide
[pulls up in his car] What are you boys doing? Get in.
Bum 11
[knocks on his window] Spare any change, sir?
Aide
[throws up his arms and shakes his head vigorously] Ahhhh! [settles down and starts driving] Come on, let's go! [some distance down the street] What the hell were you doing outside?!
Stan
Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
Aide
You aren't getting into town! It's completely overrun with these... things. [a bum lands on the windshield]
The Boys
Ahh! [the bum begins to wash the windshield]
Aide
No! I don't need my windshield cleaned! Stop it! Stop iiit! [peels off at the first opportunity] Look, our only hope is to talk to the homeless researcher out on Travis Street. He understands what's goin' on better than anybody. Just stick with me, kids. [enters an intersection, but doesn't notice the driver to his left, who's not paying attention to the road. They collide, with the aide dying on the spot]
The Boys
[exit the car uninjured] Aaahhh! [they move along the street, but notice the homeless everywhere. Another collision takes place a block away from them]
Kyle
Holy shit, dude! [behind him, the other three boys move a manhole cover off to one side, opening up a new means of escape]
Stan
Over here! [Kyle looks back. Cartman and Kenny drop down into the sewer and Kyle walks to the manhole.] Jump down! Go! [Kyle drops down, and finally, Stan]
Cartman
[pinching his nose shut with his left hand as he fans the smell away with his right] Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
Kenny
[punches Cartman angrily] (Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
Cartman
Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
Stan
Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. [they move forward.]
South Park, street level, day. The homeless have paralyzed the town as crashed cars are shown everywhere. The community center roof is shown, with Randy looking out over the parking lot with binoculars. Gerald and Jimbo sit in chairs
Randy
[lowers his binoculars] No sign of anybody else.
Gerald
[rising from his chair] That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
Randy
[turns around to face him] Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.
Stephen
And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere.
Gerald
If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
Randy
You won't make it through, Gerald! [Gerald leaves quickly and heads downstairs. He leaves the community center, only to be hounded by bums begging for change]
Gerald
[making his way through] Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.
Bums
Change? Change sir? You got some change?
Gerald
Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here. [reaches into his left pocket and tosses some change off to his left] There! There's some change. All right, a little bit. [reaches into his right pocket and tosses some change off to his right] There you go. Take the change. [leaves, but stops himself] Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?
Bum 12
Change, sir?
Gerald
Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change? [Randy follows Gerald through his binoculars] Change. Change? [Randy lowers his binoculars in horror]
Stephen
What happened?
Randy
[closes his eyes] He's become one of them.
South Park, night, under a full moon. All around town, the homeless ask for change. The boys are shown arriving at an office of some sort. They knock on the door and the homeless researcher answers it
Homeless Advisor
Go away, I I don't have any change.
Stan
Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
Homeless Advisor
Yes. Who are you?
Stan
We think this may be our friend's fault. [shows Kyle] He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
Homeless Advisor
Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on? [the boys enter and he shuts the door]
Stan
There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
Cartman
All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
Homeless Advisor
Jump them?
Cartman
I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
Kyle
Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
Cartman
I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
Kyle
You barely made it over one, fatass!
Stan
Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
Kyle
God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
Homeless Advisor
Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory. [lightning and thunderclaps follow]
South Park Community Center, night. The homeless now call up to the roof.
Randy
We don't have any change! Go away!
Linda
Anything, Stephen?
Stephen
No. All the phone lines are completely down. [the stairwell door behind them rattles and they turn to face it in fear. Randy steps toward it with his shotgun and cocks it. More knocking on the door]
A Man
[inside the stairwell] Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in.
Randy
Find another place to hide, Steve!
Steve
I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.
Stephen
We can't just leave them out there.
Steve
Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.
Linda
You have to let them in, Randy.
Randy
There isn't enough food for more people up here!
Steve
Oh God. One of them is a war veteran. [more knocking] We're gonna have to give him some change.
Stephen
This isn't happening!
Randy
All right all right, fine! [approaches slowly and opens the door. The refugees stream forth]
Bum 13
Could you spare some change, sir?
Randy
[shuts the door quickly] Harrrh!
The Homeless Advisor's lab, later. He's dissected the body of a dead homeless person.
Homeless Advisor
I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one. [a homeless man is chained to a wall by a chain around his neck. The advisor approaches him] The homeless... can survive solely... on change. [pulls out some change]
Bum 14
[sticks out his cup and strains to get the money] Change?
Homeless Advisor
They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving
Bum 14
Is that... is that some spare change?
Homeless Advisor
Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance.
Bum 14
Spare some of that change, sir?
Homeless Advisor
But now watch. [drops some coins into the bum's cup and walks back to the boys. The bum rattles his cup a bit]
Bum 14
Spare some change?
Homeless Advisor
It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here. [heads to his left and the boys follow] This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days.
Bum 15
Chaaaaange?
Kyle
What's it doing?
Homeless Advisor
It's dying.
Cartman
Cool.
Homeless Advisor
I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.
Gerald
[finds the advisor's office and enters] Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? [other homeless men follow him in]
Homeless Advisor
Oh my God, they're coming in! [leads the boys to an escape hatch above some crates] Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!
Kyle
[helps Cartman up] What about you?
Homeless Advisor
Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!
Cartman
Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
Gerald
Hello? [comes down a spiral staircase] I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?
Bum 16
Change?
Bum 17
Spare some change?
Bum 18
Change?
Gerald
Stop it! I really do need change!
Bum 16
Me too. Change?
Gerald
[outside the lab] Change? [knocks on the lab door] Hello? Do you have any change?
Bum
[outside the lab] Chaaange?
Homeless Advisor
Sorry to take the easy way out. [takes a gun to his right temple and cocks it. An exterior view of his office is shown and a gunshot heard. Back inside, he's still standing, in pain. The bullet went out the left temple, but didn't kill him.] OW! OH, FUCK! OWW! [next he tries shooting through his jaw, and the bullet comes out through his right cheek.] OHHH! AH! GOD! [shoots through his jaw again, and the bullet goes out his right cheek again. This time he gargles and drops on all fours. He shoots through his right shoulder three times, but still lives. This time he takes the gun to his forehead and cocks the gun. The exterior view of his office is shown again and a gunshot is heard. Back inside, he's still alive. The bullet to the brain didn't kill him. This time he shoots at his heart twice, and that finally kills him. He writhes around for a few seconds and dies.]
The South Park Community Center. There are so many homeless people now that it looks like a page out of "Where's Waldo?" There are now thirteen people on the roof, all asking for change.
Randy
[rifling through a box] No. No, damn it! [faces the small group on the roof with him] That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.
Jimbo
No. We can't be.
Randy
Face it, we're gonna starve!
Linda
No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
Randy
Those are cherry! Ich!
Head of Public Safety
[his cell phone rings and he rises] Wait, I got a signal! I got a signal. [dials a number]
Gerald
What? You do?
Randy
How? Call the fire department.
Head of Public Safety
I'm calling my wife! [waits for her to pick up] Mary. Mary baby, are you all right?
Linda
Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.
Stephen
Ask her what's happening.
Head of Public Safety
Mary, what's goin' on out there? Nobody's coming for us. They what? No! That's impossible. But how can that be? We didn't even- [the phone cuts out] Hello? Mary. [tries to reconnect] Mary!
Jimbo
What happened, Glen?
Glen
[Head of Public Safety] There's no help coming! She said... because of all the homeless... because of all the homeless in South Park property values have plummeted. I had two liens against my house and so the bank is foreclosing! I don't have a home anymore. [Randy and the others are quiet for a moment, but Randy knows what he must do. He pumps his shotgun and aims at Glen.]
Linda
Randy, what are you doing?
Randy
He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
Glen
I'm not like them.
Randy
Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
Linda
[tries dissuading Randy] And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?
Randy
If we have to! Siddown Glen!
Glen
Randy, you can't just-
Randy
SIT... doowwwnnnn!
Another shot of the homeless on the street.
Back to a shot of the roof. Glen is sitting under a blanket again.
Glen
This is crazy. How can they just take away my house? Where am I supposed to put all my things? I don't have a place for all my stuff; where am I supposed to put all my stuff? I'll need to pay for storage. Can I borrow some- money to put my stuff in storage? Come on guys. If you all just help me out a little bit. Each one of you just put in a little... change? Change? [That's it. Randy fires at him and blows the upper half of his head off. Randy sighs heavily]
A brilliant sunrise in the Rockies. Another shot reveals a ruined town - Evergreen. The four boys arrive and look at the destruction
Stan
What the hell happened here? [three men in camouflage appear and aim their shotguns at them]
Man 1
[wearing a white and blue bandana around his neck] That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!
Stan
We, just came to ask a question.
Man 2
You homeless or homeowners?
Kyle
We're nine.
Man 1
Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!
Stan
Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
Cartman
Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
Kyle
Shut up, Cartman!
Man 1
Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
Cartman
Youu heard about that?
Man 2
Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.
Cartman
Thirty was hard enough.
Kyle
Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
Stan
Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
Cartman
Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
Man 2
Well, that was easy. [the group moves to a clearing where the boys sit on a bench while the first man serves himself some coffee and begins explaining]
Man 1
The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know! [sips] Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War! [Kyle notices something on the ground] That's when I started suspecting that [the something is a pamphlet that says "HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS" on the front cover. He picks it up] my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept. [Kyle reads the pamphlet] After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. [Kyle opens the pamphlet and is met with these words: "HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS. TRY SOUTH PARK."]
Kyle
You son of a bitch. [gets off the bench and approaches the first man with the pamphlet] You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! [opens the pamphlet to show him]
Man 1
That's right, yes.
Stan
What?
Kyle
I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
Man 1
And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
Stan
[getting off the bench] But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
Man 1
Right. But we survived.
Woman
[pops up out of nowhere, almost a skeleton] Dehhhnyihhhs! [she's armed with a rifle and ready to shoot]
Dennis
[Man 1, turns around. The other two men look as well] Christine!
Christine
You sonothatitch! You tried to kinn me!
Dennis
I had to, Christine, you were homeless.
Christine
No, I wasn't honeless yeh stukid asshole!
Dennis
Christine, I can't understand you.
Christine
Yeah! Gecause you durned my yits oth!
Dennis
I nurned your rip sauce?
Christine
No! You durned my yits oth!
Dennis
I have no idea what you're saying! [Christine shoots him] Ow! [Dennis is dead. The third man kills Christine, who fires one final shot and hits the second man. The second man kills the third and dies moments later]
Stan
Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
Kyle
[turns around] No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
Stan
No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
Kyle
That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
Kenny
(What are you gonna do?)
Kyle
We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
Montage: the boys modify a bus. Stan works on the front fenders. Cartman works on brakes and accelerator. Kenny works on tightening the barbed wire running along the roof's edge. Kyle works on putting up a shield in front of the bus with a screw gun. Stan moves to the transmission. Cartman and Kenny reinforce the sides of the bus. Kyle works on the PA system.
The community center roof. The refugees sit around. A bus horn is heard and the refugees rouse themselves. Randy looks out over the parking lot and sees the bus. The homeless clear a path for the bus
Randy
A bus! A bus is coming!
Jimbo
[seeing who's inside] It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
Stephen
I knew they'd come back for us!
Linda
All right!
A Woman
Yeah.
Randy
[props up Glen's corpse so it faces the bus] Look, Glen. We're saved. [the bus stops]
Stan
All right, I'm turning around
Stephen
Why are they turning?
Randy
[drops the corpse] What are they doing? [the bus turns so the front end now faces away from the community center. Randy calls out] Don't leave us!
Kyle
All right, hit it.
Cartman
Let's hope to Christ this works. [prepares to press the red button. Music begins to play]

You can chill if you're homeless.
[the music stops. Three homeless men sleep on the Strand and Cartman sails over them, landing on the third man and skating away]

Bum
Eughuhuh.
Cartman
[jumps off his skateboard, throws down his helmet and exults] Yes! That's three homeless! Suck on that! Fuck yeah! [faces his friends and the bums]
Stan
Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
End of Night of the Living Homeless


Le Petit Tourette
Toy Safari, day. Shoppers walk by, enter, leave, browse, etc. Inside, in Aisle 3: Action Figures. Cartman browses one set of shelves. Another boy is shown behind him, browsing the facing shelves.
Cartman
[picks out a figure] Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip. [moves the package around with his left hand and strokes his chin with his right] That's pretty kewl. Let's see...
Boy
Cock! [Cartman is startled.]
Cartman
[puts the Slammer back on the rack and selects another figure.] The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
Boy
Asshole! Cock! Asshole, shit, shit cock! [his neck and face get taut as he blurts this out]
Clerk
[nearby] Ma'am, is that your son over there?
Mom
Yes, I'm sorry. My son has Tourette's Syndrome.
Clerk
Tourette's Syndrome?
Mom
It's a neurological disorder. He-he can't control what he says.
Clerk
Oh...
Boy
[turns his head hard to the left, his eyes shut] Shiit! [turns his head back to face forward] Dumb shiiit!
Mom
[goes to take her son home] A-alright Thomas, maybe we should go?
Thomas
All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!
Mom
Here, let's buy you a nice toy to take home. [selects a figure and hands it to Thomas, who walks away with her, smiling. Cartman watches as they leave]
Cartman
[turns around and walks off, saying softly] Dude, that mom is kewl. [he arrives at the checkout line with his action figure]
Thomas
[stands in line behind Cartman] Cocknut! Augh... Stupid shit!
Cartman
[turns around and glares at Thomas] Are you talkin' to me?!
Thomas
No. Cocknose!
Cartman
What's your problem, kid?!
Mom
Oh, a-I'm sorry. [Thomas backs away a bit] My... son Thomas has Tourette's Syndrome. [a crowd begins to gather around them]
Cartman
What?
Thomas
Mom, let's just go. Shhhit!
Mom
People with Tourette's can't control certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze.
Thomas
Asshole ASSHOLE.
Cartman
[waves his arms around] Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
Thomas
Mom, can we just go home, please?
Mom
It's okay, Thomas. They understand.
Thomas
I want tuh go! [throws down his action figure and walks off, his hands over his mouth] Shitfag!
Man 1
Poor kid.
Clerk
Yeah.
Cartman
[turns around and faces the crowd] All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
Clerk
It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
Man 1
Yeah! [Cartman blinks - CHING! He begins to think: "I've got a golden ticket... I've got a golden"]
Cartman
Twinkle in my eye. [turns and heads for the entrance] haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. [throws his action figure into the air and runs out the door]
Clerk
Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
Cartman
I don't need the toy! I've found something better! [dances away] 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
Colorado Neurology Center, some days later. A doctor checks Cartman out as Liane watches
Liane
It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
Cartman
Puh- pussy!
Liane
Oh...
Cartman
Pussy! Cock! Shit! [covers his mouth in faking embarrassment]
Liane
Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called "Tour, Tourette's Syndrome"?
Cartman
Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! [covers his mouth immediately]
Doctor
That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.
Cartman
...Cocksucker!
Doctor
[begins to think and walks off a bit] ...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse.
Cartman
Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
Liane
Oh Doctor, can you help him?
Doctor
[turns around and walks back to them] We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can.
Cartman
But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
Doctor
Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.
Cartman
Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! [gives him a mischievous look]
South Park Elementary, day. Cartman walks into view as the kids are at their lockers
Cartman
Shit! Butthole! [walks up to Wendy] Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry. [smiles and moves on] Titties! Cock! [he's relishing this. He points to a redhead] Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
Kyle
Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. [she walks up to them]
Cartman
Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
Principal Victoria
Good morning, Eric. [turns right and walks away. Cartman walks off in the opposite direction]
Kyle
Did Cartman just say "shitballs" to the principal?
Butters
Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
Kyle
What?
Craig
[in admiration] He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say "shitballs" to the principal I'd be sooo happy.
Cartman
[deciding to explain things. Mr. Mackey is in the background] Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole! [the other kids lean away] Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
Principal Victoria
It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.
Kyle
[after some thought, points and says] He's faking.
Cartman
[his thunder is stolen and he covers for it] Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle? [walks to Kyle] Asscheeks! [hauls Kyle off to a clearing] Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
Kyle
You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
Cartman
...Oh, okay, you figured me out. [claps] Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
Kyle
Who cares about saying whatever you-?
Cartman
Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
Kyle
Grrhh, whatever. [walks off in a huff. Mr. Mackey walks by]
Cartman
Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! [Mr. Mackey does nothing but walk away]
Craig
If I could say "asspussy" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.
Mrs. Garrison's class, later. Mrs. Garrison writes a math problem on the board: (-7)X(-2)
Mrs. Garrison
Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?
Cartman
Dicktits!
Mrs. Garrison
[glances back at Cartman, then finishes writing] -when we multiply a negative number by another negative-?
Cartman
Shit! Asshole! [Mrs. Garrison looks at Cartman with a bit of shock, then turns to the board.] 'Scuse me. [Cartman smiles]
Mrs. Garrison
Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-
Cartman
Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch! [the class laughs. Cartman pretends to be hurt] You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
Mrs. Garrison
[facing the class] All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay? [turns to the board] Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers
Cartman
Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
Kyle
Will you knock it off already?!
Cartman
Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
Kyle
Don't push me, asshole!
Mrs. Garrison
Kyle, watch your language! [Cartman lets out a hearty laugh]
Craig
[getting miserable] If I could yell "tampon dickshit" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.
The principal's office, later. Mrs. Garrison is inside talking with her.
Mrs. Garrison
Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore.
Principal Victoria
I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. [Mr. Donaldson walks into view]
Mr. Donaldson
Hello Mrs. Garrison- [turns his head to the left] Ass. ASS. [recovers] I want to help your class better understand this illness. [turns his head to the left] Piss!
Kyle
[walks into the office, with Cartman following] No! Up yours, fatboy!
Cartman
Kyle please! I'm sorry!
Kyle
Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
Mr. Donaldson
Faking? [Kyle is sure he's got Cartman on the hook] You think people with Tourette's are faking?!
Kyle
[his certainty gone] N-no, I'm just saying that I think-
Mr. Donaldson
Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say? [turns his head to the left] Ass! ASS! [recovers] We aren't "faking", young man. Trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass. [turns his head to the left] PISS! PIIISS!
Cartman
That's right, Kyle. [turns his head to the left, where Kyle happens to be] Crap-filled vagina!
Mr. Donaldson
This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?!
Principal Victoria
No.
Mr. Donaldson
This if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take this "bully" to see that Tourette's is very real. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss.
The Children's Therapy Center, day. Mr. Donaldson is seated with seven kids on chairs in a circle in the middle of the room. Two of them are Thomas and Kyle.
Mr. Donaldson
Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor. [turns his head to the right, where Kyle happens to be. Kyle jumps in his chair] ASS! [recovers and clears his throat] I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's
Teen Boy
Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze. [shakes his head quickly] Brrrrr! [recovers] It isn't contagious like some people think. [shakes his head quickly] Brrrrrrrrr!
Blonde Girl
A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics. My tic [leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers] is that I have to bend my neck and snap her fingers. But a lot of people don't even notice it. [leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]
Thomas
[turns his head to the right] Aw shit! COCK!
Brunette
Sometimes it can be embarrassing to have Tourette's, but I [blinks and bobs her head] Boop. I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself.
Mr. Donaldson
You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!
Kyle
L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
Teen Boy
Fun? [shakes her head quickly] Brrrrr! [recovers] This really isn't all that fun. [shakes her head quickly] Brrr, brrrrrr!
Thomas
Aw shit!
Brunette
[blinks and bobs her head] Boop. [The blonde girl leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]
Mr. Donaldson
[turns his head to the left] Piiiss, coming from my aaass!
Thomas
Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents [turns his head to the right] Aw shit! [recovers] My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.
Kyle
Dude...
Mr. Donaldson
Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so.
Kyle
Aw, come on!
Mr. Donaldson
So then you apologize for what you said before?
Kyle
Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [The blonde girl leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]
The Children's Therapy Center, outside. Mr. Donaldson takes Kyle to his waiting parents as the other kids look on.
Mr. Donaldson
Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities. [turns his head to the left] Piss! PISS!
Sheila
Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
Mr. Donaldson
Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate. [Cartman walks into view and bats his eyes at Kyle sweetly. Kyle does not appreciate this]
Gerald
Well Kyle?
Kyle
[grudgingly] I'm sorry.
Cartman
Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
Kyle
[grudgingly, louder] I'm sorry.
Cartman
You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
Kyle
I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- [stops himself]
Cartman
Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother. [looks at Gerald and Sheila] Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
Sheila
Oh, thank you Eric.
Cartman
Thank you. Big-nosed kike! [Sheila laughs nervously]
Mr. Donaldson
Well I think we can all put this behind us now. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss out my aaass!
Cartman
Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face! [thumps his chest and clears his throat] Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one. [starts to walk away] Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works. [stops to whisper to Thomas] Isn't having Tourette's awesome? [leaves]
A Dateline commercial. Dateline graphics come up
Announcer
Next week on Dateline NBC: it's a Dateline special report.
Hansen
I'm Chris Hansen. You probably know me from To Catch A Predator, where we bust men looking for sex with children.
a clip from that show
Hansen
Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there.
Predator
Oh God, Whoa no.
Hansen
What are you doin' here?
Predator
I'm just' bein' stupid, I guess.
return to the current show, with graphics indicating the change of focus from pedophiles to Tourette's
Hansen
But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.
Cartman
[doing a voice-over]
Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman

[he doesn't say his name]

Hansen
This Saturday on Dateline I'll be bringing you Eric's story, live and uncensored, from his home in Colorado.
Announcer
Living with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story. This Saturday on Dateline NBC.
Cartman
[adding to the commercial] Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true. [jumps at the camera] Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! [jumps back in shock, covers his mouth, then smiles at the camera sweetly, bending his head to the right]
A sleepy night, Cartman's house.
Cartman's room. Cartman makes himself a drink, adult-style: He has two liquor bottles, a bucket of ice, and two wine glasses. Why two? Hm... He serves himself some ice. A few seconds later, Kyle enters his room and slams the door shut
Cartman
Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
Kyle
What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
Cartman
[serves himself some liquid] Yes. It's all finally come to fruition. [gently swirls the ice around] The final cog in my... master plan. [turns around to face Kyle] This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air. [turns back and prepares a drink for Kyle] Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
Kyle
Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
Cartman
[takes the drink to Kyle] Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
Kyle
...Scotch?
Cartman
[quickly gives him the drink in triumph] Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
Kyle
You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
Cartman
Then the game is on, Kyle.
Kyle
It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! [Cartman looks at his drink]
Cartman
[walks back to make another "Scotch"] Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? "Big titties! Buttmunch!" There's no walls anymore! "Shit!" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. "I wet my bed last night." [realizes what just happened]
Kyle
What did you say?
Cartman
Uhh nuh-nothing...
Kyle
You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! [runs out of the room and slams the door]
Cartman
Hm. That was... weird.
Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gultch, day. Inside, a crowd has gathered to watch this Dateline special. A banner hanging from the ceiling says "WE'RE PROUD OF YOU ERIC!" On a low stage are Mr. Mackey, Liane Cartman and Eric, Mr. Donaldson, and Principal Victoria
Mr. Donaldson
We are here today to congratulate a brave little boy. Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television and become the spokesman for Tourette's Syndrome. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss out my aaass! [applause rises from the crowd]
Thomas
The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no... [turns his head to the right] Cock!
Cartman
[Mr. Donaldson adjusts the mic to his height] Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls! [applause rises from the crowd] You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. [applause rises from the crowd]
Craig
If I could say "titty sprinkles" on national television I would be sooo happy.
Cartman
And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up! [startled by his own words, then covers his mouth as the crowd falls silent.] Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad. [turns away from the mic and mumbles] What the hell is going on?
Mr. Mackey
Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?
Cartman
No hey ut what, what I meant to say was "asslicker cumballs." And uhh, [helplessly] I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! [covers his mouth]
Patty
Eewwww!
Cartman
[clambors offstage] Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! [runs through the crowd]
The mens room. Cartman runs in and heads for the sink. Butters is pissing at the urinal and his pants are at his ankles. Cartman washes his face.
Butters
[does a double take and smiles] Uh hey Eric!
Cartman
[finishes up and looks at Butters] Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
Butters
Wuh who are you talking about?
Cartman
Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners. [he covers his mouth in horror as Butters is stunned] Wah! [faces Butters]
Butters
You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
Cartman
I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! [runs out of the restroom]
The dining area. Cartman runs through the crowd
Cartman
Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!
Liane
Is there a problem, sweetie?
Cartman
[turns around and faces her] No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's [struggles to keep control] AAAA no, NAAAA! [he's got the crowd's attention] I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year. [now composed] Ah, I need to be going now.
Mr. Mackey
Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.
Cartman
[apprehensive] Dateline. Right. [backs away but can't control his statements] I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! [runs out the door with his hands firmly over his mouth]
KSPC Channel 4, an HBC affiliate, day. In his own office, Hansen rehearses his lines as the staff listens. A cameraman preps his camera
Hansen
Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen.
Cartman
[rushes onto the set] Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
Hansen
Why not?
Cartman
My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
Hansen
[rolls up his notes and motions Cartman to a stool] Why don't you have a seat?
Cartman
No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
Hansen
Go ahead and take a seat.
Cartman
[heads for the door] But I'm not gonna do the-
Hansen
Take a seat, right over there. [Cartman backs up and sits on the stool, then puts his cap on the bar] What are you doing here?
Cartman
I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
Hansen
But you are doing the show.
Cartman
You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
Hansen
Well of course you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.
Cartman
No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad. [gets his cap and puts it on] So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. [hops off the stool and walks away]
Hansen
Why don't you take a seat?
Cartman
Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
Hansen
Have a seat.
Cartman
[begins backing up] No, I'm just gonna go- [wonders how this is happening]
Hansen
Take a seat, right over there.
Cartman
[gets back on the stool and whispers to himself] How does he do that?
Hansen
You know, one tiiime, I was doin' a show called "To Catch A Predator". We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan from us 'cause he didn't wanna be on Dateline. Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself. [Cartman is scared] It'd be a shame if... you didn't wanna go on Dateline. Be a shame if we had to track you down and you "shot yourself". [Cartman is more scared, and a series of expressions cross his face]
The program begins: "Dateline \living with tourette's syndrome."
Announcer
Live, from our satellite studio in Colorado. This! ...is Dateline.
Hansen
Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome. I'm [stretches his name out so it sounds like nails on a chalkboard] Chris Hansen. In a few minutes, you will meet little Eric Cartman, who wants the world to understand his affliction.
The green room. Cartman paces back and forth. Someone knocks on the door
A Page
Five minutes, kid.
Cartman
Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this? [walks to a nearby table and begins to pray] God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like "I touched penises with my cousin!" [covers his mouth quickly] Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
KSPC Channel 4, outside, night, moments after the program began. Kyle jumps into view wearing dark camouflage and a headset at the parking lot entrance
Kyle
Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
Thomas
[using a walkie talkie] Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit!
Kyle
You sure you don't wanna back out?
Thomas
Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!
Kyle
All right, then we go with the plan. Just like "To Catch A Predator". [a light brown car pulls in] The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. [the car stops and Thomas looks around]
HotForBoys219
[walks up to Thomas] Hi, are you CuteBilly182?
Thomas
Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!
HotForBoys219
[shaking with excitement] Oh God, I'm so turned on right now. This is your house? Your, your parents aren't home, are they?
Thomas
N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!
HotForBoys219
[dances by] Okay. Cock! Don't take too long. [laughs and prances into the studio]
The studio set. The opening segment is finished.
Hansen
So now let's meet a child who haaas Tourette's Syndrooome, and who must fi- [the audience doors open and HotForBoys219 prances down the aisle laughing]
HotForBoys219
Ho, whoa, wait a minute. This ain't no house.
Hansen
[stands up angrily] What are you doing?!
HotForBoys219
[gasps and hides his face] Chris Hansen?! Oh no, it's a setup! I knew it!
Hansen
Sir, why don't you take a seat, right over there.
HotForBoys219
Now everyone's gonna know I'm a perv! Whoa! [takes out a gun and shoots himself in the head. Nearby audience members move away, and the audience gets restless]
Hansen
Aw, not again.
The green room. Cartman paces back and forth. The door opens and Kyle walks in
Cartman
Kyle?
Kyle
Surprise, fatass!
Cartman
Kyle, what are you doing?
Kyle
I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly! [car horns blare outside, and Kyle goes to take a look. The parking lot quickly fills up as drivers park and leave their cars.] Whoa.
Outside. Thomas sees the pedophiles coming and motions them into the studio
Pedo 2
[walks up to Thomas and waves a Wendy's bag in front of him] Hey, I brought you some Wendy's.
Thomas
Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!
Pedo 2
Score! [goes inside]
The studio set. The driver stops in his tracks
Pedo 2
Oh no, it's Chris Hansen! [drops his meal and shoots himself]
Audience Members
Whoa! Who is that? What's going on?
Hansen
What the hell is going on?!
Pedo 3
Wait a minute. Oh God, it's Chris Hansen! [shoots himself]
Pedo 4
Chris Hansen! [shoots himself]
Pedo 5
Dateline?! [shoots himself]
Pedo 6
I knew it! [shoots himself]
Pedo 7
There aren't really brownies! [shoots himself. More pedophiles enter and kill themselves, and the audience begins rushing out of the studio]
Outside. Chris Hansen finds Thomas.
Hansen
Hey! Do you have something to do with this? Answer meee!
Thomas
Stupid shit! Cock! [more audience members rush by]
Hansen
What?! Nobody talks to me like that! Why don't you take a seat? Take a seat, right over there.
Thomas
Suck it! Asshole licker dickfart!
Hansen
Fine, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you! [leaves, and there are no other adults left]
Craig
[walks up to Thomas] Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy.
Thomas
You would?
Craig
Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?
The studio set. It's dim, and Cartman and Kyle walk onto the set.
Kyle
[feeling triumphant] Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! [Cartman is silent for a moment, then hugs Kyle and sobs. Kyle wasn't expecting this]
Cartman
Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
Kyle
No, I- I beat you!
Cartman
You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say! [heads up the aisle and out of the studio] I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! [Kyle is alone on set, but Thomas comes up and stands next to him]
Thomas, Kyle
Aww shit!
End of Le Petit Tourette


More Crap
Hell's Pass hospital, a patient's room. Randy is sitting on a bed as Dr. Doctor checks his vitals. Randy lets out a sigh of pain.
Dr. Doctor
Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated. [walks over to a table]
Randy
[quite aware] Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
Dr. Doctor
Well, what food have you been eating?
Randy
P.F. Chang's, mostly. [rubs his belly] Good stuff.
Dr. Doctor
I'm going to prescribe a laxative. [writes out the prescription and turns around] But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful.
Randy
How painful is "painful"?
The Marsh house, night. Randy is in the bathroom trying to crap. He strains and groans for a good long while.
an Emmy Award statue floats up into view, and a banner saying "EMMY AWARD WINNING SERIES" shimmers after.
Randy
Oh God. Oh, here it comes. [he goes for the final push, which has him pushing himself off the toilet seat by his hands several times. A few seconds later, the banner and award disappear] Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot! [a view from the street. Randy's moans can be heard as he can be seen moving about] Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot! [back in the bathroom. The stool finally comes out] Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo. [begins to sob from relief] Ohhh, it's over. It's over. [reaches for the toilet paper to wipe his ass clean] Oh God. [puts his briefs and pants back up in place] I feel so much better. Oh. [a view from within the toilet: Randy turns around to flush, but stops, looks down, and crouches down for a better look] Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?
Sharon
[opens the door and enters] What is it, Randy? Do you have any- [looks in the toilet] OH! [squeezes her eyes closed and covers her nose with her right arm] Randy!
Randy
Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
Sharon
[a view from behind the toilet] Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!
Randy
Come on! That's pretty impressive! [Stan wanders in from the hall, and Stan calls him] Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. [Stan walks closer to the toilet]
Sharon
Randy!
Randy
[on bended knee next to Stan] Look what your old man made.
Stan
No way!
Randy
Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
Stan
No, never.
Shelly
[wanders in] Gross, Dad, sick! [turns around quick and leaves]
Sharon
All right, will you flush the toilet now?! [crosses her arms]
Randy
[rises and leans over to flush the toilet. Stan steps out of he way] I'll try, but I don't think- [stand straight again] wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.
Sharon
Why?!
Randy
Well he's gotta see this.
Sharon
No, we are flushing the toilet right now-
Randy
[turns around and blocks any access to the toilet] No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!
Sharon
Oh, for the love of God, Randy! [turns left and leaves]
Randy
Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. [spreads his left and hunches down in a defensive position]
Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. It's open and the sound of men laughing is heard. Inside, the town's men are gathered for Happy Hour. Randy enters the bar
Randy
Hey guys!
Gerald
Hey Randy.
Stephen
Oh, hey Randy.
Stuart
Are you feelin' better?
Randy
Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.
Jimbo
You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.
Randy
[being modest] Well I don't know about ever...
Randy
I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
Randy
[being modest] I guess it was pretty big.
Stuart
A football? That's amazing.
Stephen
I've never heard of one that big.
Gerald
[chuckles] Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. [laughs. The other guys laugh, but Randy shuts up and looks around]
Randy
[softly] It wasn't bigger than mine was.
Gerald
Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! [laughs. The other guys join in]
Randy
[softly] Mine... mine was bigger.
Gerald
I doubt it. [snicker]
Randy
[looks around] You wanna see it?
Randy's study, later. Randy leads the other men in towards a covered display case. Present are Jimbo, Gerald, Skeeter, Stephen and Stuart. Randy takes off the wraps and steps back so the other guys could behold the greatness that is Randy's crap.
Stuart
Oh my freaking Lord.
Skeeter
That did not seriously come out of your ass.
Randy
Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
Gerald
Jesus...
Stan
[feeling vindicated] That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
Gerald
It's... other-worldly.
Stephen
Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!
Randy
[gets out a spray can of water] That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. [spritzes the poop so it doesn't dry up and crack apart under the two lights it's under]
Sharon
[at the doorway] Randy Marsh!
Randy
[quickly hides everything under the wraps] Aw crap!
Sharon
What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
Randy
The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
Sharon
Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!
Guinness Book of World Records, corporate office, day. In the secretary pool, a secretary picks up a phone
Secretary
Guinness World Records America. How can I help you? [listens while typing with the right hand, then stops altogether] The biggest crap? We actually don't keep track of that record, sir. [listens] Because we don't want to. [listens] Look, we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap, and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification. [listens] You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. [listens] You're welcome. [hangs up and resumes typing] Jeez, another one. [the phone rings again and she picks up] Guinness World Records America.
Randy
[gets through. The other guys stand by the sofa] Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. [holds a thumbs up. The other guys do as well]
Secretary
[long sigh, then flatly] You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. Their number is listed on their Web site.
European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office, Zurich, day. Majestic music plays. Inside, a woman and several men in judge's robes walk around chatting with other officials
Chubby Official
[hands a manila envelope to a balding gray-haired man] Herr President, take a look at this. [the president opens the envelope and looks at a picture within it] It is a crap sent to us from the United States.
EFSM President
Very niiice. [it's a picture of Randy measuring the crap with a measuring tape and grinning at the camera] Has it been checked for accuracy?
Chubby Official
It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo. We estimate that the crap is over eight and a half Courics!
EFSM President
[serious] We'd better get on a plane. Right away. [smiles]
Randy's study, some days later. Three representatives of the EFSM Office are inside inspecting the crap as Randy watches on, and sniffing from time to time.
EFSM President
Hm, enshnusen?
Chubby Official
Verron snusunarich.
EFSM President
What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh?
Randy
Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
Chubby Official
I believe I detect some cabbage as well?
Randy
Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.
Sharon
[at the doorway] You have got to be kidding me.
Randy
[turns around and marches towards her] These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! [the EFSM President joins Randy]
EFSM President
It is a tremendous crap, Mr. Marsh.
Sharon
For the love of God!
EFSM President
Your crap officially weighs... 8.6 Courics
Randy
Courics...
Chubby Official
The standard measuring unit for human feces. One Katie Couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement.
EFSM President
The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.
Randy
But that means...
Third Official
That's right. You are the new world's champion!
Randy
Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?! [jumps for joy] Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! [walks off]
EFSM President
Well, I guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken.
An awards ceremony.
M. C.
He has won twenty-two Grammy's, countless humanitarian awards, and is the only person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and the Nobel Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono! [fanfare goes up amid applause. Bono rises from his seat on stage and struts over to the mic. He grabs the award from the M.C., kisses his left index and middle fingers, and throws the kiss off to the audience]
Bono
[wearing a fancy straw cowboy hat] Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award; it means so much. [a phone rings and he looks around] Oh. Excuse me. I must be getting another award. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out a cell phone. He answers it] Yes?
EFSM President
Yes, Bono, sir, we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken.
Bono
What?! That's impossible! How big was it?
The White House, day. An elaborate stage with three massive LCD screens is set up. "Stars and Stripes Forever" plays
Senator
We are here to honor the first American to bring home the distinguished EFSM medal for biggest crap ever taken. [applause. The Marshes are present. Randy is decked out in garlands. Sharon looks quite embarrassed. Jimbo, Gerald, Stephen, Stuart, and Skeeter are behind them]
Randy
Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
Senator
To present the award I give you the dean of the EFSM, Sir Orloff Broloff. [makes way for the dean, who is also the president]
Broloff
Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas-
Chubby Official
Herr Broloff! Herr Broloff! [whispers into his ear]
Broloff
Das shpoitenhoff? [to the crowd] Ahhh ladies and gentlemen, I understand we have just received a special video-taped announcement from Bono!
People in Crowd
Oh! Bono? Cool!
Broloff
Could we play the tape on the big screen, please?
The tape. Bono appears onscreen without his hat.
Bono
Hello everyone! I, am Bono. ["BONO" flashes on the screen a few times, then a short montage of pics follows. "Hello, hello, helloooo Yeah yeah yeah yeah." "BONO" flashes on the screen a few times more, then he speaks] For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics.
Crowd
Whoa!
Sharon
[lifts her head up] Bono?! [a shot of the monster appears next to a Grammy award for comparison - the Grammy looks like a toy]
Bono
As you can see, it is one solid piece. [another shot of him adoring his massive crap on a cushion flanked by two Grammys] It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless. [an exiting montage follows, and the screens turn off]
Broloff
You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is... 9.5 Courics! Congratulations to Bono! [fanfare goes up amid applause]
Man
Bo-no! Woo-ooo!
The Marsh house, day. Randy sits on the edge of the back porch crying. Stan comes out to check on him
Stan
Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.
Randy
[from the heart] I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter. [sobs some more] I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!
Stan
Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.
Randy
[instinctively replies] You're welcome. [continues] And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
Sharon
Come on guys, lasagna's ready.
Randy
[angrily] Oh. Lasagna's ready. [turns around] You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!
Sharon
What are you talking about?
Randy
[walks up to her] You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!
Sharon
Randy, this is ridiculous!
Randy
[offended] Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke! [Sharon avoids eye contact] Don't touch me! [pulls away a bit, then goes back inside the house]
Sharon
[to Stan] Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!
Stan
You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. [turns around and walks in]
Sharon
Wha? Wha?
Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. The men are gathered there again for Happy Hour, but they're all depressed.
Jimbo
How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?
Stuart
'Cause he's Bono, that's why.
Stephen
But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!
Randy
Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
Gerald
[slams his fist on the counter] Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
Randy
[incredulous] What?
Gerald
Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
Stephen
[getting enthusiastic] Hey. Hey that's right.
Randy
Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
Skeeter
Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!
Stuart
With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
Randy
[rises and heads for the door] Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!
Stephen
Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!
Randy
[with some resignation] I would need a lot of help.
Gerald
That's what we're here for.
Jimbo
Come on, Randy, what do you say?!
Randy
I say... [turns around] Let's give Bono a run for his money! [the other men are glad to hear this, so they mob him and talk about it] Yeah!! [shakes his head like a lion] YYEEAAHHHH!
CNN Headline News.
Anchorman
Tonight, a possible attack on Iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the Middle East.
Sharon
Oh no.
Anchorman
But first, the record for the world's biggest crap: will it again be broken?
Sharon
[disgusted and annoyed] Agh!
Anchorman
Randy Marsh of Colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap, spending nearly every waking hour at P.F. Chang's. [a shot of Randy feasting away on noodles, shrimp, crab legs, etc.].
Female Anchor
Is this really newsworthy?
Anchorman
You just don't understand.
Female Anchor
You're right. I don't.
Anchorman
[the camera zooms in on him] At the same time, some people are questioning Bono's current record entry, saying nobody has ever seen it in person. Bono could not be reached for comment, as he is currently in Africa helping the needy.
An African sunset. Bono dances down a dirt street in a slum, singing "Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah..." His phone rings and he answers it.
Bono
Hello, hello.
Broloff
Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.
Bono
He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!
Broloff
Well he's going to try.
Bono
Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.
Broloff
Bono, we've never had that rule before.
Bono
I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!
Back at Hell's Pass Hospital. Randy is looking quite bloated now, almost... pregnant.
Assistant
Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first. [does this and lets it spread]
Randy
Oooooo.
Assistant
Okay, take a deep breath. [Randy takes the breath and the assistant puts the camera on the belly, then turns to the monitor to his right] I see the crap now. I can't say for sure, but I, I'd say is about... 14 Courics.
Jimbo
Fourteen?! [grins]
Stephen
That's great, Randy!
Randy
Can I, can I see it?
Assistant
Sure. This is your colon, a-and here... [softly, warmly] is the feces growing inside your belly. [a musicbox begins to play as Randy marvels at his poop]
Randy
Ahhh...
an Emmy Award statue floats up into view, and a banner saying "EMMY AWARD WINNING SERIES" shimmers after.
Gerald
[rushes into the room] Guys, we have a problem! [the Emmy and banner disappear] I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.
Randy
In Zurich?
Gerald
They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
Assistant
I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester.
Bono's mansion, big enough to be a hotel. Stan is at the front doors, ringing the bell. A butler opens the doors.
Stan
Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
Butler
Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller! [two doors fly open and Bono dances out of a ballroom]
Bono
Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going. [puts on his hat]
Stan
Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
Bono
Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?
Stan
That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
Bono
Let him have it? Why would I do that?!
Stan
Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
Bono
[walks over to his trophy section and whips out a trophy containing an open magazine.] I have the first-place trophy for that.
Stan
[a bit shocked] Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
Bono
I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.
Stan
All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
Bono
[insulted] Number two?! NUMBER TWO?! [grabs Stan, throws him up against a gold record on the wall and holds him there]
Stan
Agh!
Bono
Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!
Stan
I take it back!
Bono
Say I'm not number two!
Stan
You're not number two!
Bono
That's right! I'm not! [releases him and dances back to the ballroom, singing away. The butler returns]
Stan
What is wrong with that guy?
Butler
Your father is in grave danger. Come with me! [Stan follows him out]
EFSM Office, Zurich, day. In the main lobby, Randy is on a toilet made for this occasion, pushing hard to get that poop out, but it's taking a while... He takes several quick breaths to try again... He pushes hard again. Bono is present for the delivery.
Chubby Official
It must be quite a crap.
Jimbo
Come on, Randy. You have to push! [Randy takes several more quick breaths and pushes...]
The German Autobahn. Bono's butler zooms down the road with Stan riding along
Stan
What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
Butler
Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!
Stan
So Bono's newest record is a lie!
Butler
Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960.
Stan
So?
Butler
So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...
Stan
He's the record.
Butler
[whispers] Yes.
EFSM Office, Zurich. Randy has yet to squeeze it out.
Randy
[in frustration] I can't do it! I can't do it!
Assistant
The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!
Randy
But then, does it still count?
Bono
Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!
Broloff
I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap.
Randy
[sobs] No... Nooo...
Jimbo
There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
Randy
I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? [she walks up to him]
Sharon
[pissed off] What?!
Randy
I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
Broloff
Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact.
Bono
I had a feeling it would be.
Stan
[runs in] Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
Bono
Get him out of here!
Third Official
What are you talking about, young man?
Stan
Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
Bono
It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!
Broloff
It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth.
Chubby Official
Herr Broloff, what do you know of this?
Broloff
It's true, I'm afraid. You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap. I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken.
Bono
Poppa no! Say nothing more!
Broloff
Come to me my... darling precious child. [Bono sobs and walks over to him. Broloff hugs him] After I had broken the record I took the crap home. I was so proud of it that I... decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child.
Bono
No Poppa... No Poppa...
Broloff
[strokes his hair] There there, my little crap. [props Bono's chin up] Don't cry. [unbuttons his coat, vest, and shirt] Here, do you want the biddy? Hm? [holds his left breast out to Bono] Does Bono want the biddy? [Bono whimpers and begins sucking on the teat] Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he?
Stan
Dude.
Broloff
I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy. And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up! Into one of the most influential figures of our time. [looks down] Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy.
Bono
Biddy. [keeps sucking]
Broloff
My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything.
Stan
That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
Chubby Official
You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff.
Broloff
Have I?! [pops Bono off his tit. Bono tries helplessly to return to the tit and suck on it] Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record!
Randy
Oh God, here it comes! [everyone gathers around him again, even Sharon] Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot! [he poops, and begins to rise as the poop piles on] Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot [finally stops. Beneath him is a pillar of poop almost six feet tall]
Third Official
My God...
Chubby Official
It must be over a hundred Courics!
Stan
Dad, are you all right?
Randy
Yeah, I'm... [looks down at his accomplishment] I'm good! [arms akimbo] Feel a lot better.
an Emmy Award statue floats up into view, and a banner saying "EMMY AWARD WINNING SERIES" shimmers after.
Chubby Official
[approaching] Mr. Marsh, we apologize, and if it's okay with you, we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy. [the banner disappears, but the official reaches out and grabs the Emmy. He walks over and jams it into the pillar of poop. Everyone claps except Stan and Sharon.]
End of More Crap

Imaginationland
The forest outside South Park, day. The camera pans down from the trees and settles on the forest floor, on which Cartman appears, followed by Tweek. Cartman is dressed like a lumberjack, with flannel shirt, vest, and rope.
Cartman
All right, let's try over here. [points straight ahead. Jason appears behind them] Set up traps there, and there as well. [points right] Last time I saw him he ran right through here. [moves, revealing Stan further back. Cartman moves to his left, and Kyle is seen sitting on a fallen tree]
Kyle
This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
Cartman
[sets up a trip wire between two stones] It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now. [drops the rope, walks forward, and whips out a walkie-talkie] Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
Clyde
This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. [behind him are Jimmy, Jason, and Craig hoisting the net into place]
Cartman
Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. [Tweek joins Stan in the background]
Kyle
Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
Cartman
O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?! [whips out his walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
Token
[pissed off] ... I don't want the code name Blackie.
Cartman
Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! [puts away the walkie talkie and gets back to setting the trip wire.]
Kyle
This is fucking retarded!
Cartman
Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. [finishes setting the trip wire]
Kyle
Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
Cartman
[whispers loudly] Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet? [whips out the walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
Butters
[stands on a lookout platform with a telescope next to him. He answers in a subdued manner] This is faggot. Go ahead.
Cartman
Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
Butters
Okay, will do. Faggot out. [turns right and looks through the telescope] Waagh.
Kyle
Okay, that's enough. [hops off the tree and walks forward] Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
Cartman
It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
Kyle
You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
Butters
Uh, I got somethin'! I got it! [the other boys turn and pay attention] It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
Cartman
[to Token] Set off diversion track C! [Token sets off a small bomb under a pile of leaves. Nearby a leprechaun skips into view, then stops upon seeing the boys]
Stan
Dude...
Jimmy
Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
Cartman
[charging forth] Get it! [the leprechaun runs away, and all the boys except Kyle, who is dumbfounded, give chase] Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! [the leprechaun crawls under a tree trunk and gets up. He trips over a rope and a net descends on him; he dodges it and runs off. He runs into a bush and trips a sliding door, which drops down behind him. It traps him in a cage. He looks around for a way out, but sees the boys crowd in.]
Butters
Wow.
Stan
Cool.
Craig
No way.
Token
Whoa.
Jason
Wow.
Cartman
[making his way through, out of breath] Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
Leprechaun
You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
Cartman
[gets out a Bowie knife] Tell me where the gold is or you die! [unsheathes it] Slow! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him out and disappears]
Stan
Where'd he go? [the leprechaun appears on a tree limb behind the boys; they turn to look at him again]
Leprechaun
I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him away and disappears]
Craig
Dude.
Cartman
[walks up to Kyle and clears his throat] Kyle, suck my balls. [brings out the contract both of them signed. Kyle stands motionless]
SOUTH PARK
KYLE SUCKS CARTMAN'S BALLS

THE TRILOGY
The dining room. The family is at dinner, eating silently. Kyle has got something on his mind, as he's not eating.
Kyle
Dad, where do leprechauns come from?
Gerald
[not skipping a beat] From Ireland.
Kyle
So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
Sheila
Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.
Kyle
I thought I did. [the doorbell rings and Sheila rises to get the door]
Cartman
[walks in with the contract and a camera] Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
Sheila
Oh,hello Eric. [leads him to the dining room] Kyle, your friend is here.
Cartman
Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
Kyle
[gets off his seat and stands between Cartman and the table] Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
Cartman
Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
Kyle
I'm not doing it, fatass!
Gerald
Doing what?
Cartman
We had a deal, Kyle!
Kyle
Just get out of here!
Cartman
[walks up to Kyle] You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
Kyle
I don't care if I signed an agreement!
Gerald
Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
Cartman
Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
Gerald
What was the agreement?
Kyle
That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
Sheila
Whatwhatwhat?!
Cartman
And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
A neighborhood clearing, day. Stan, Butters, Jimmy, and Kenny are working on a massive snow sculpture. Kyle walks up to them.
Kyle
Hey dudes. [the boys stop and pay attention]
Jimmy
Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?
Kyle
How was what?
Jimmy
Sucking Cartman's b-balls.
Kyle
I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
Stan
[walks up to him] Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
Kyle
Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
Fanciful Mayor
[dressed in a Southern Victorian outfit, polka-dotted yellow pants, and curled shoes] Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately?
Stan
...What do you know about the leprechaun?
Fanciful Mayor
Ooooo, then you did see him. [twirls] That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing?
Kyle
All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
Fanciful Mayor
Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination? [whips out a striped cane and turns to Stan] You young man! How would you like to be a cowboy? Or a- swashbuckling pirate? [moves over to Kyle] And you! How would you like to be an astronaut, faaar out in space? All it takes is a little... [taps his head with his left hand] imagination.
Stan
Who the hell are you?
Fanciful Mayor
Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine? [before them appears an elegant red blimp with four smaller yellow balloons from which hangs a small wooden ship with three wheels underneath it for landing on solid ground]
Kyle
Dude.
Fanciful Mayor
Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.
Butters
Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?
Fanciful Mayor
[confused] Ubeuh... uh... n... no?
Butters
Ah, all right then.
Stan
Come on, guys. [the others follow him, with Butters trailing.]
Butters
Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
Fanciful Mayor
All aboard the Imagination Balloon! [sounds the boarding bell and lifts off as the boys draw up the rope ladder.]

Some people feel imagination isn't real, but I tell them that they're wrong,
'cause whenever I want to play and pretend, I just sing the Imagination Sooong
[the song consists of the one word "imagination," repeated. The ship floats lazily over the countryside, then over the Platte river and a bridge, then over another river flanked by meadows and woods, and ever higher into the sky, then over the Rockies].

Kyle
[at his limit] Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
Fanciful Mayor
Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here.
Imaginationland, where whatever fantastical creatures you could imagine exists. There are two moons and two pointy stars in the sky and mountains whose tops bend over like witches' hats. There are castles everywhere with flags atop them. As the Imagination Balloon floats in, a flying giraffe is shown, as is a flying city, a griffin, an elevated tram and its cars, and many, many creatures strange and familiar. The creatures all turn to see the ship and follow it to its landing
The Boys
Whoa...
Stan
What is this place?
Fanciful Mayor
This... is Imaginationland. [a yellow rocket flies in and lands on its own] It's where all the wonderful and goofy things that humans have made up over the years live together. [more of the land and its inhabitants are shown, and the balloon finally lands in the middle of town. The Mayor climbs down the rope ladder] Citizens of Imaginationland! We have distinguished guests from the world beyond! [the creatures ooo and aaa about them]
Cheetara
Hello. [the boys climb down. Butters is excited]
Lollipop King
[a walking lollipop with a crown and lollipop scepter] Welcome to Imaginationland. I am the Lollipop King.
Mr. Tumnus
[bows] We are honored to have Creators in our kingdom.
Fanciful Mayor
Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun! [the creatures jump for joy]
Pat the Hammer
What did he tell you? Did he have any news?
Stan
[hesitantly] Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
A Terrorist
[runs in out of nowhere] ALLAH!!! [he stops, rips open his jacket, and shows off the bombs strapped to his body]
Fanciful Mayor
[closeup] OH FUCK NO! [the terrorist sets off the bomb as everyone else leans back. The explosion sends creatures flying everywhere, with some of them dying as their bodies fall apart. Charlie Brown is blown away, losing his left leg below the knee.]
Charlie Brown
Awwwgh! [falls on his face]
Cheetara
[running past Stan] AAAAAH!
Stan is battered and looks for shelter. He finds it under a giant mushroom. He is now in a daze and time begins to move slowly for him. He watches as Raggedy Ann tries to revive a destroyed Raggedy Andy, but it's no use. He then turns to see Santa set ablaze and set two moon-bellied sneetches on fire. The action takes on a war-ravaged tone as Ronald McDonald finds he's lost his right arm. He sees it on the floor and walks over to pick it up with his left hand. He winces, then sees a large building go up in flames as burning creatures run about. An explosion sends the building's tower crashing down in front of the building. The terrorist fires away with his automatic machine gun. Stan begins to recover as he puts his cap back on. A faun runs past him in the background, and Kyle arrives. His lips move slowly and Stan doesn't know what he's saying.
Kyle
[aboe all the noise] STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! [Jimmy is with him. The three take off. The terrorist appears behind them, but doesn't see them. Kenny joins the group as a dragon drops down from the sky.]
Draco
Quickly boys! Get on my back! [the boys climb on and Draco takes off]
Butters
Fellas! Fellas wait! [the boys look back at Butters, who is running up to them as fast as he can] Hold on, fellas!
Stan
Butters.
Butters
Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! [a terrorist knocks him down with the butt of his gun, then kicks him around. Two other terrorists join in]
Kyle
Dude! [the terrorists keep kicking Butters around]
Butters
Hey guys!
The Boys
Butters!
The Broflovski House, morning. Kyle wakes up startled in his room and sits up.
Kyle
A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. [gets out of bed and walks off]
The Marsh house, morning. Stan is eating cereal at the breakfast table when the phone rings.
Stan
[picks up] Hello?
Kyle
Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
Stan
No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
Kyle
[speechless, then] ...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
Stan
Yeah! How'd you know?
Kyle
Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
Sharon
[enters the kitchen] Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? [with her are Butters' parents. Linda is distraught]
Stan
Why?
Linda
Our darling Butters never came home last night.
Kyle
What did they say??
Steven
We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals. [Linda starts crying] There there, darling.
Kyle
[hearing the crying] ...Dude...
The Pentagon, Washington D.C., day.
General Deckter
[serious] Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news. Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours, terrorists successfully attacked... our imagination. [the other officials there look around and murmur at each other]
Man 1
Our imagination?
Woman 1
[behind him, with gray hair] How?
Specialist
The imaginary attack appears to have been in the works for years. The effects of the attack are so far... unimaginable.
General Deckter
We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public. [clicks on a remote control, and the video appears onscreen. The Fanciful Mayor is on the ground with a blindfold on. A Care Bear sits to his right with a blindfold on as well. The terrorist starts speaking, then backs up to shoot a Care Bear in the head]
Fanciful Mayor
No! It's just a Care Bear! [a terrorist knocks him down with the butt of his gun. A fairy godmother walks up to check on him]
Man 2
Oh my God.
General Deckter
[fast forwards the tape] Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.
Butters
[reading the statement at gunpoint] Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day. [a terrorists brings forth a severed bear head to show the viewers] Oh jeez! [the terrorist withdraws] Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels! [there's no more to read] Can I go now? [two terrorists come up and drag him away. The one wearing a vest takes the statement away from Butters.] Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? [the tape is stopped]
General Deckter
Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.
Colorado State Courthouse, day.
Cartman
[as the plaintiff, with a lawyer] I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt. [Kyle is the defendant, without a laywer] A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls! [the judge can't believe what she's hearing] I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
Judge
[looks over the contract in front of her] Mr. Broflovski, did you agree to orally imbibe Mr. Cartman's scrotum and testicles?
Kyle
I...
Judge
[shows Kyle the contract] Is this not your signature on the contract?
Kyle
Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
Judge
From what I've been presented and the evidence put forth, the court has no choice but to order you to place Mr. Cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth, and draw upon it succulently for no less than 30 seconds.
Cartman
[pumps his left fist] Yesss!
Judge
You have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls. If after that time you still refuse, the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt. Next case! [lowers the gavel. The camera is in a position to see it block Kyle from view.]
Cartman
Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
The Pentagon, Washington D.C., day. General Deckter and four of his top people sit opposite a dark-skinned man. There are other people present
General Deckter
What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination. [the man is now shown close up] Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them.
Specialist
In times like these the government often turns to Hollywood for help. You creative filmmakers can think of idea we just can't.
General Deckter
That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam. [the camera zooms out a bit and shows the name tag in front of the man: the director M. Night Shyalaman] The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?
M. Night Shyalaman
What if... [the top officials lean in] What if it turns out they aren't terrorists? But they're actually werewolves? From the future?
General Deckter
N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda.
M. Night Shyalaman
But what if Al Qaeda, it turns out, is the group being terrorized? By aliens?
General Deckter
No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.
M. Night Shyalaman
How about we make everyone think that terrorists attacked us? But really, we were all already dead.
General Deckter
[to the specialist] Get him out of here. [M. Night Shyalaman is hauled away, only to be replaced by...] Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?
Michael Bay
I believe I can. [the officials get their pens ready to write] We start... by making a big CG building and then we have a meteor go CROSSHH! [makes a diving motion with his left arm] and it, and it's all like CRAAWWWLL [simulates an explosion with his arms] a-and motorcycles burst into flame while they jump over these helicopters, right? [has his right hand go over his left arm like a motorcycle over a helicopter]
General Deckter
[firmly] No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!
Michael Bay
An eighteen-wheeler spins out of control and it's all like BROSSHH [makes a crashing motion with his right hand] And then this huuuge tanker full of dyna- [launches into a series of explosions]
General Deckter
[fed up] Those aren't ideas, those are special effects!
Michael Bay
I... don't understand the difference.
General Deckter
I know you don't. Get him out of here! [next in the chair is Mel Gibson] Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.
Mel Gibson
[twisting his hipples hard] Ah, my nipples, they hurt! They hurt when I twist them!
General Deckter
[dismayed, drops his head into his left hand] Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?
Mel Gibson
How about this? You have that tape that the terrorists made, right? Well, maybe if you did a background check on that videotape, you might find somebody who doesn't belong. Somebody who doesn't fit in Imaginationland![twists his nipples again] Ohhh!
Specialist
Heyy... that's not a bad idea.
General Deckter
Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!
Mel Gibson
[twists his nipples from the excitement] Oogh! Yess! [grins]
some hours later.
Specialist
All the imaginary characters in the tape were identified, sir. Count Chocula, Cinderella, Snarf from Thundercats... But here. [clicks. Butters is shown in full] Nothing in American folklore or storytelling match this kid. He appears to be... just some kid. [zooms into Butters. The last few seconds of the tape are replayed: "Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here??"]
General Deckter
[determined] I want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat! [slams his right fist into his left hand] If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!
Specialist
Yes sir! [leaves, and General Deckter is alone in the meeting room with Butters' image]
General Deckter
[walks up to the screen and stares intently at Butters' image] Who are you?...
Imaginationland, the aftermath. Butters and the Mayor have been released and join the survivors. Mighty Mouse sits on a talking suitcase, Link tends to Tumnus. Other survivors are the Flash, the Wild Thing, H.R. Pufnstuf, Count Chocula, Orko, Pat the Hammer, Cinderella, Totoro, and Humpty Dumpty
Butters
Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir? [a shot of the terrorists arming the rocket from the beginning of the episode] Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back- [one of the terrorists says something to him and cocks his gun] Aaah! [holds out his palms and backs up to join the survivors] Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
Pat the Hammer
Can you tell what the terrorists are doing?
Fanciful Mayor
They're going something to Rockety Rocket.
Rockety Rocket
No! Leave me alone! Haaa!
Cinderella
It doesn't make sense. What do they want with Rockety?
Fanciful Mayor
The only reason they would- [shuts up upon a realization] Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier!
Butters
Uh what's the Barrier?
Fanciful Mayor
The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side! [the wall, which is rather low, is shown. Beyond it is a dark place, full of lightning and unknown dangers]
Rockety Rocket
No! No you can't blow up the barrier! Are you insane?! [the terrorists talk amongst themselves]
Cinderella
We can't let this happen.
Suitcase
It will be the end of Imaginationland.
Pat the Hammer
Yeah. You have to stop them, kid.
Butters
Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
Fanciful Mayor
Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!!
Butters
[frightened] Waaahaa!
Cartman's house, day. He's the the whole house decked out for a party. A lush Arabian party. Persian throw rugs are spread out all over the floor. The sofa has been converted into a royal litter. His classmates mill around drinking juice. Cartman enters the living room dressed as a sultan
Cartman
Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
Craig
He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
Cartman
He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
Clyde
Hey, he's here. [the kids turn to face the front door. Stan and Kyle walk towards the house together]
Cartman
What? Move aside, move aside! [moves through the crowd to the door]
Stan
Dude, do you really have to do it?
Kyle
Let's just get this over with!
Cartman
Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
Kyle
God damnit!
Cartman
Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! [the sound of helicopters ruins the moment as Cartman's smile vanishes and he looks around. Stan and Kyle turn around and see the helicopters. Police cars and government vehicles converge on Cartman's house as the copters land. General Deckter, specialist, two soldiers, and two security guards pour out of the helicopter]
Specialist
That's them, sir. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski.
General Deckter
You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.
Kyle
Who are you?
General Deckter
There's no time! You need to come with us right now! [prods the boys towards the waiting helicopter]
Cartman
[runs up and grabs Kyle's free hand] Hey, let go of him! [Kyle is now in a tug of war between Cartman and General Deckter]
General Deckter
We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.
Cartman
No! No, he has to suck my balls! [loses his hold on Kyle and falls to the sidewalk on all fours. He gets up and runs after the helicopter, which takes off quickly. All the other vehicles pull out. Cartman runs down the street a bit] NO! KYYYYLE! [loses his turban]
Imaginationland. The terrorists make the end run with Rockety Rocket towards the Barrier.
Rockety Rocket
No! Noooo! [Butters comes into view to stop them]
Butters
Hold on! Hold on a second! [the terrorists screech to a halt] Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
Terrorists
[having had time to think about it, they give their answer] ALLAH!! [they charge forth with Rockety Rocket toward the door, then push him forward. Butters jumps out of the way.]
Rockety Rocket
AAAAAAAH! Jesus Christ, no!! [reaches the door and blows up. The terrorists cheer and fire away into the air. Butters gets up near the survivors]
Fanciful Mayor
That was your plan to stop them??
Butters
Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?
Fanciful Mayor
That's fucking stupid! [the ground begins to shake under them as rumbles come from the evil side of Imaginationland. The terrorists stop firing. Cracks appear on the door. The Mayor says with dread] They are coming... [the door falls apart. "TO BE CONTINUED" appears over the action]
The desert, day. An oil rig moves east. The cab is red with a white stripe. Cartman is inside with the driver
Driver
Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'
Cartman
Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
Driver
You goin' to Washington to visit family?
Cartman
I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice... [looks at a picture of Kyle] is the justice you take. [to the picture] Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. [runs his finger over Kyle's mouth]
End of Imaginationland


Imaginationland, Episode II
Previously on South Park.
Cartman
[voiceover] Previously on Battlestar Galactica [clips from last week's episode follow]
Stan
What is this place?
Fanciful Mayor
This... is Imaginationland.
A Terrorist
[runs in out of nowhere] ALLAH!!! [the terrorist sets off the bomb as everyone else leans back. The explosion sends creatures flying everywhere, with some of them dying as their bodies fall apart.]
Kyle
[above all the noise] WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
Butters
[running up to the boys as Draco takes off with them] Hold on, fellas!
The Boys
Butters.
General Deckter
Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.
Fanciful Mayor
[to Butters] If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out!
Terrorists
ALLAH!! [they charge forth with Rockety Rocket toward the door, then push him forward. Butters jumps out of the way.]
Rockety Rocket
No!! [reaches the door and blows up. The terrorists cheer and fire away into the air. Butters gets up near the survivors]
EPISODE II
The screen brightens, and a bedroom is shown. A music box plays as the camera pans to the left. The bed is shown, and Butters is asleep in it.
Butters' room, morning.
Steven
[voiceover] Butters, time for breakfast.
Butters
Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
Steven
[enters with Linda, who's holding a plate] Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you.
Butters
[chuckles with relief] Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
Steven
You are in Imaginationland. This is a dream.
Butters
Huh?
Fanciful Mayor
[breaking into the dream] Hey, wake up, stupid! [the bedroom transitions into Imaginationland] Come on, wake up, kid!
Butters
[wakes and stands up] No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
Fanciful Mayor
NO! You passed out and peed your pants!
Cinderella
Look! The evil of Imaginationland is coming out! [monsters from the evil side pour through the broken wall. The survivors from the terrorist attack turn and run away]
Butters
Oh hamburgers! [the terrorists fire off their guns, but a monster wipes them out]
Fanciful Mayor
Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest! [catches up to Butters] Come with me, little boy! I'm going to get you home! [an Alien jumps into view and jumps around the Mayor]
Butters
WAAAA! It's Alien! [points to the Xenomorph, which grabs the Mayor, lifts him up, and attacks him from behind and pierces right through him, killing him instantly. Butters runs away, only to be spotted by a Predator with laser sights. Butters avoids the lasers] Predator! Wha? [an army of Imperial Stormtroopers head his way. A heavy footfall behind him alerts him to Jason Voorhees's presence. He jumps] Huh? [Jason takes out his machete and slashes at him, but Butters ducks it and runs away] WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! [geometric shapes and Tribbles join the fray]
The Pentagon, day. General Deckter and his specialist interrogate Stan and Kyle in the same room the directors were in previously. General Deckter paces back and forth.
Stan
Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
General Deckter
[stops and places his hands on the table] What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!
Kyle
We just... went on a balloon ride.
Specialist
There must have been some kind of portal or doorway.
Stan
Dude, we don't remember.
General Deckter
Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild! [wags his left index finger at them] You'd better start remembering!
Specialist
It was the Chinese, wasn't it?
Kyle
...What?
Specialist
We've suspected that the Chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination. [wags his right index finger at them] Is that where you were?!
Stan
No.
General Deckter
That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?
Specialist
It is better than ours?
Stan
Your what?
Specialist
Our portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-
General Deckter
[puts his hands on his hips] Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret.
Tom
[a bit chagrined] Ohh, I'm sorry sir.
Kyle
Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
General Deckter
Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!
Tom
Yes sir. [to the boys] We built a portal to the imagination to use against the Russians during the Cold War, but we never got a-
General Deckter
THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!
Tom
[more chagrined] Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir.
Stan
If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
General Deckter
[turns his back to the boys] All right, we might as well show it to them. [whispers] God-dammit, Tom.
Darkness.
Cartman
[voiceover] Every night, the dream is the same. [a field of grain pops up with purple mountains in the background. Cartman walks in smiling and holding the contract] I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls. [Kyle is standing in the field, and Cartman walks up to him] And it turns out I was right. "Time to pay up, Kyle." [Kyle's name echoes into the distance] But then... [Kyle turns around with his mouth sewn shut] "NO! NOOO!" [Cartman rises into the air and the field fades to black] It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. [he floats through the darkness. His right testicle pops and dissolves into the air. His left one does the same, and there's no penis left either.]
In a bus. Cartman shakes himself awake
Elderly woman
You okay, kid?
Cartman
NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
The Pentagon, the portal. The technicians prepare the portal
General Deckter
Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called "Project Imagination Doorway."
Stan
That's not very imaginative.
General Deckter
According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has.
Lead tech
But we're close, sir. We're real close.
General Deckter
They've been saying that for over forty years.
Lead tech
[walks up and stands next to General Deckter] You're the ones, right? The kids who have been in the imagination.
Kyle
Ah I guess.
Lead tech
What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out.
Kyle
Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
General Deckter
Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.
Lead tech
What song?
Stan
The Imagination song?
Lead tech
That could be it. The fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code!
General Deckter
Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?
Stan, Kyle
[unsure of the notes] Imaginaaaation Imaginaaaation

Operator
Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something.
Lead tech
[urgently] Was there more to the Imagination Song? Ha, how does the rest of it go?
Stan, Kyle
Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-

Kyle
No, no dude, it went up there.
Stan
Imagina-he-hey-

Kyle
Imagina-eh

Stan
[to General Deckter] Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
General Deckter
I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety! [Stan and Kyle look at each other.]
The Gumdrop forest. The Mayor is flat on his back, still alive, but with heavy blood loss. He gargles in trying to move. The Lollipop King and Butters gather around him.
Lollipop King
Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do?
Butters
Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
Fanciful Mayor
Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times.
Butters
Really?
Fanciful Mayor
NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke! [groans for a few seconds more]
Snarf
Mayor, what are we supposed to do, shnarf shnarf?
Fanciful Mayor
Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!
Lollipop King
Castle Sunshine?
Fanciful Mayor
Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain! [groans once more and dies]
The evil characters have gathered in a clearing in the woods of Yum Yum mountain.
Orc
We are free! Now all of Imaginationland is ours!
The Minotaur
Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts of Imaginationland we don't control.
Freddy Krueger
Tomorrow, we shall build our own castle right on this spot!
The Minotaur
Who put you in charge, Krueger?! I am the most evil character here!
ManBearPig
[half bear, half manpig] Nonsense! [somehow, he's been spliced together and brought to life] Your evil is stale!
Headless Horseman
[holding a flaming jack-o-lantern on his left hand] I am the most evil imaginary character! [Krueger hisses]
Squirrelly Squirrel
[hops into view] Now come on y'all. We shouldn't be fightin', we're supposed to all be on the same side. [the rest of the Woodland Critters arrive]
Critter
Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel.
Woodland Critters
Yaaaay!
The Minotaur
What evil imaginary characters are they?
Creature from the Black Lagoon
They were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his Christmas Story..
Squirrelly Squirrel
Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing, there could still be survivors out there. We need to hunt them down, and kill them.
Rabbity Rabbit
And eat their flesh!
Beavery Beaver
B'hut first we should rape them!
Beary Bear
How about we kill them, and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant?
Squirrelly Squirrel
Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear. [the Critters cheer and jump for joy]
Jason Voorhees
[to Khan in a campish voice] Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt THOSE things up.
The Mall at Washington D.C., Day. Cartman has arrived and is on a pay phone.
Cartman
Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
Secretary
[at the Pentagon] I'm sorry, sir. That information is classified.
Cartman
Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
Secretary
[sees Tom arriving] There's somebody asking a lot of questions about what's going on.
Tom
Let me handle this! [takes the receiver] I'm sorry, but there is no such thing as Project Imagination Doorway! [listens] Imagination Doorway. It was started in the Sixties as a secret government project. Right.
The portal inside the Pentagon, day. Stan and Kyle rehearse the song, singing better on key than before.
Stan, Kyle
Imagina-a-ation, Imagina-

Stan
Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
Kyle
Right, then it was
"Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"

[the lights dim and the portal begins to glow. The boys are confused for a moment, then face the portal with the other people present]
Lead tech
It's open! It's open!
Operator
Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir! [the officers and techs all cheer and hug each other. Stan and Kyle stand there, awed]
General Deckter
All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!
The Gumdrop forest. Butters walks with Snarf and the Lollipop King along a multicolored road. Huge gumdrops line the road on either side
Butters
How much further to Castle Sunshine?
Snarf
Snarf, I'm not sure snarf snarf. I've never been. [a female scream stops them in their tracks]
Butters
What was that?
Lollipop King
[walks to his left into the woods] Over here. [the other two follow and peer over some bushes] Oh Christ. Its Strawberry Shortcake. [in a clearing, Strawberry Shortcake sits on a stump, tied up so she can't move. Many evil characters surround her, ready to do her great harm]
Strawberry Shortcake
Please, let me go. [the Headless Horseman kicks her] Wuh. [Frankenstein's Monster kicks her] Wuh! [an Imperial Stormtrooper smacks her around with his rifle] Dugh! [Jason walks up and put his knife under her eyes...]
Snarf
Oh my God! Snarf. [and scoops out her left eyeball.]
Strawberry Shortcake
Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!
The Minotaur
Now kill her!
Squirrelly Squirrel
[the Woodland Critters show up] Whoa whoa, hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her. That's not evil enough.
Freddy Krueger
What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.
Jason Voorhees
Yeah, that's super hardcore.
Squirrelly Squirrel
Now come on y'all. We can do better than that.
Beavery Beaver
Hey! I know! Let's all pee in her empty eye socket!
Deery Deer
Let's make her eat her own eyeball, and then pee in her empty eyesocket.
Beary Bear
How about we get someone with AIDS to pee in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike? [the other Critters cheer at the idea]
The Minotaur
Nobody here has AIDS!
Woodland Critters
Awwww!!
Beary Bear
But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eyesocket!
Squirrelly Squirrel
Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can find some AIDS out in the forest. [the Critters scatter in renewed enthusiasm]
Lollipop King
Dude, run, run, ruuun! [Butters and Snarf leave quickly, and he follows]
The portal at the Pentagon. Some army troops in camouflage arrive and the techs finish up preparations. General Deckter paces in front of the soldiers.
General Deckter
All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?
Soldiers
Yes sir!
General Deckter
Are you ready, Kurt Russell?
Kurt Russell
[dressed in camouflage like the others] I... I don't understand why I'm here. I I'm just an actor.
General Deckter
Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!
Tech 1
Sir, we have a security breach!
General Deckter
What?!
Tech
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
General Deckter
Sector Two?? [a large window at the far end of the room shatters as Cartman tumbles in, landing on his back. Everyone turns to see him]
Kyle
Cartman??
Cartman
[gets up quickly and marches towards Kyle] Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
General Deckter
Who the hell are you?!
Cartman
That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
General Deckter
Get him out of here!
Cartman
[some guards seize him and begin to drag him away] No! Hold on a second! [they stop and let him go] I have a contract [holds it out] validated by the United States court system!
General Deckter
Let me see that! [a guard takes it from Cartman over to General Deckter, who reads it over] Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?
Kyle
I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
General Deckter
All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.
Kyle
[stunned] Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
Deckter
You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.
Kyle
[looks at General Deckter, than at Stan] Stan?
Stan
Dude, you did make a deal... [Kyle has run out of appeals and reluctantly follows Cartman out]
Cartman
Theee conference room is which way? [smiles]
Conference room, later. Cartman and Kyle sit facing each other.
Cartman
Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
Kyle
I didn't "bail," I got picked up by the government!
Cartman
Well we're here now, that's all that matters. [brings up a small cup of mixed nuts] Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
Kyle
Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
Cartman
[cuts him off with a loud yawn and hops off his chair] Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle. [walks towards a tripod and sets a camera on it] It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
Kyle
Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
Cartman
Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle. [starts unzipping a duffle bag] I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. [pulls out a purple robe]
Kyle
No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! [pounds the table with his left fist]
Cartman
[puts on the robe] Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do. [pulls out a crown and turns to face Kyle] By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are... [puts on the crown] extra vinegary...
Kyle
Just get to it already!
The portal at the Pentagon. The soldiers move slowly towards the portal. General Deckter walks up to the lead tech
Lead tech
Entering the portal in five seconds.
General Deckter
Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?
Kurt Russell
Check 1, 2.
General Deckter
Good luck men! Godspeed! [the soldiers walk up the ramp and through the portal] What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?
Kurt Russell
[voice only] We're here. We're s-somewhere.
Tech 3
They are inside the imagination, sir.
General Deckter
What do you see in there?
Kurt Russell
There's lots of... big mushrooms, colorful grass, some castles in the distance, eh... Wait. Something's coming for us! It's coming out of the bushes and- [everyone braces for the worst] It's a-! ...Oh, Aw, it's just a cute little squirrel. [Everyone relaxes. Stan draws a sigh of relief] Hey, it talks, haha. The little squirrel talks.
Lead tech
Awww, an imaginary talking squirrel.
Techs
Awww.
General Deckter
Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.
Kurt Russell
Wait a minute, eh. The squirrel has friends. Oh why, why it's a whole bunch of woodland critters.
Stan
Wait, woodland critters... [begins searching his memory]
Kurt Russell
There's a talking bear and a beaver, uh... the, they seem to be Christmas critters. Well hello. Yes, hi.
Stan
Get them out of there!
General Deckter
What?
Stan
Tell them to get away now!
General Deckter
What's the matter?
Kurt Russell
Oh the... cute little bear's eyes are starting to glow red now... Uh hello there, little animals, do you happen to know how to huh? OW! AAAAAAAHHHH!
General Deckter
Kurt Russell, what's going on?!
Kurt Russell
They're raping mee!! They're raping meee!!!
General Deckter
Get out of there, Kurt Russell!
Kurt Russell
They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh!
The conference room. Cartman fine-tunes the camera position.
Cartman
I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
Kyle
Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
Cartman
No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus. [sets the depth] There we go. [smiles, then returns to his seat] Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
Kyle
Let's just DO IT! [pounds the table with both fists]
Cartman
In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- [a red alert interrupts him]
Guard
Everyone to the main hall now! Go!
Cartman
Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
Guard
Everyone to the main hall NOW! [Kyle heads for the door and out behind the security guard]
Cartman
No! Goddammit no!
The Gumdrop Forest. Butters, the Lollipop King, and Snarf continue down the Rainbow Road.
Snarf
Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf.
Butters
Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
Lollipop King
Wait! There it is. We made it! [a rather impressive complex looms before them] Castle Sunshine! [they rejoice at the sight, but a hissing sound follows] Hurry! Get inside! [they run towards the castle]
Perseus
The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons! [more survivors walk in]
Butters
Wait! Waaait! [the trio reach the castle gate and Perseus stops them with his sword]
Perseus
What imaginary character are you?!
Lollipop King
The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?
Snarf
And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf.
Perseus
[to Butters] And what imaginary character are you?
Butters
Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
Perseus
What's a "Butters"?
Snarf
The Mayor brought him and some other kids into Imaginationland just before the terrorist attack.
Perseus
So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!
Butters
I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
Perseus
You caught the Leprechaun? Take him!
Snarf
Perseus! He's not against us snarf snarf!
The portal at the Pentagon. The portal has begun to act violently. Lightning shoots out from the portal and it changes color frequently. Everyone backs away.
General Deckter
Talk to me! What's going on?! [the guard comes in with Kyle and Cartman]
Lead tech
Something is... coming through the gate from the other side. [a few moments later, ManBearPig walks through]
Operator
What is it?!
Tech 4
Its like a... half man half bear!
Lead tech
And half pig! [ManBearPig grabs a tech and slams him against the portal's supporting wall]
Tech 5
Oh! No, no wait! It's like a half bear half manpig! [ManBearPig rips the tech's head off and tosses it towards General Deckter. Everyone scatters]
General Deckter
Look out! [ManBearPig jumps over and grabs the tech at both ends]
Lead tech
No! I think it's more like a half man, and half pigbear! [ManBearPig rips him in two at the waist]
General Deckter
Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!
Kyle
AAAHHH! [runs away, but ManBearPig scoops him up]
Stan
KYLE!! [a fading tech pushes the red button at his station as he drops to the floor. Lightning flashes into the room as a tractor beam pulls Stan into the portal. ManBearPig resists the pull, but crushes Kyle in its left hand for several seconds]
Kyle
AAAAAAAAAAAA- [ManBearPig lets go of Kyle as the tractor beam fiinally pulls it in. Kyle lays on the floor, blue in the face]
Castle Sunshine, inside. Perseus leads Butters, Snarf, and the Lollipop King down the main hall as two Tron soldiers escort them.
Butters
Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
Perseus
That is for the Council of Nine to decide!
Lollipop King
Don't worry, kid, the Council of Nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all Imaginationland
The meeting room. At a triangular table sit nine imaginary characters. On the left side of the table are Gandalf the Grey, Glinda the Good Witch, and Morpheus. On the right side are Zeus, Luke Skywalker, and Popeye the Sailor. Sitting on the third side with their backs to us are Jesus and Wonder Woman. At the opposing vertex sits Aslan the Lion
Aslan
Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.
Zeus
Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it!
Aslan
And what say you, Morpheus?
Morpheus
How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.
Glinda
Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon. Surely they wouldn't chase us there.
Jesus
[rises] No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.
Luke Skywalker
I'm with Jesus. The evil characters aren't going to just let us go. [Popeye says something, but it's unintelligible] That may be, Popeye, but we don't have a choice! [the doors open and the Council looks to see who's entering]
Perseus
Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world.
Aslan
Bring him here!
The portal at the Pentagon. Paramedics have arrived to check on Kyle. One of them tries to resuscitate him with a defibrillator.
Paramedic
Clear! [sends power through the paddles. Kyle rises, then falls softly. No sign of life yet. The paramedic removes the paddles and announces] I'm sorry. He's gone.
Cartman
No! Kyle can't die. [gets on his knees and checks various parts of his body for a pulse]
Paramedic
I'm sorry, young man.
Cartman
Kyle?
Paramedic
Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.
Cartman
[enraged] NNNOOO! [begins giving Kyle CPR] No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
General Deckter
He's gone, little boy.
Cartman
[to the paramedic] Zap him again! [opens Kyle's coat and shirt for better contact] Do it!
Paramedic
Charging.
Cartman
DO IT! [the paramedic places the paddles back on Kyle's body] Come on buddy.
Paramedic
Clear.
Cartman
Come on buddy. [the paramedic fires away. Kyle rises, then falls softly. No sign of life yet.] Get out of here! [goes back to giving Kyle CPR. A woman covers her eyes in despair] Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight! [smacks Kyle around] Fight! Fight! Right now! [begins to break down] Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight! [pounds Kyle's chest hard] Fight! [Kyle coughs, then comes to. Cartman begins to weep happily.] Give him some air. [an oxygen mask appears and Cartman places it over Kyle's nose and mouth.] There, easy. Breathe easy. [weeps softly some more]
The meeting room at Castle Sunshine. Butters now stands on a platform in the middle of the table
Aslan
I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.
Zeus
What are you saying, Aslan? That if we are to take back control, we might-?
Morpheus
Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.
Butters
Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
Luke Skywalker
If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge.
Butters
But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
Aslan
It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.
The portal at the Pentagon. A large missile is being wheeled into place.
Tom
Sir? Are you sure about this?
General Deckter
We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option. [the missile is in place] We have to nuke our imagination. [the missile is lifted and tilted]
A hospital room. Kyle is resting. A few gifts lie near him. Cartman rises from under the bed with his crown and robe on and contract in hand
Cartman
Wake up, Kyle. [Kyle wakes up to a smiling Cartman]
End of Imaginationland, Episode II

Imaginationland, Episode III
Imaginationland. Recaps from the other two episodes follow. First scene: Arrival at Imaginationland
Aslan
[voice only] Imaginationland... used to be a happy place. But then the terrorists attacked. [a shot of a terrorist blowing himself up, killing many imaginary creatures] And so many of us were killed. [a shot of Santa on fire, then a shot of the Barrier falling apart] The Barrier came down, and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed. [the evil characters pour through the Barrier. Next shot is Strawberry Shortcake being kicked by the Headless Horseman, then by Frankenstein's Monster. Aslan now appears] Now our final battle will take place. The evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out. [various shots of evil characters on the march]
Beavery Beaver
This is gonna be fun, huh? [the other Woodland Critters whoop and holler]
Aslan
We prepare for a battle we cannot win. [a shot of Popeye honing swords, then a shot of Luke Skywalker handing swards to imaginary creatures. Totoro gets one, then a robot] Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon, [Donatello puts a helmet on Snarf's head. Wonder Woman hands a sword to a doll character] must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number, [Mario takes a full-sized sword and walks away with it without a problem. Superman walks off with a battle axe. A smurf tries to take a sword, but has trouble moving it once it's on the floor. Another character takes a spear] but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy. [walks over to Butters as other members of the Council look on] Only you can help us win this battle.
Butters
Wuh, what can I do?
Aslan
You have a power here that you have yet to understand.
EPISODE III
Static appears on screen, then clears up to a security camera clip of ManBearPig attacking Pentagon officials after entering the real world through the portal. After ManBearPig rips the lead tech in two, the tape is halted
Al Gore
[voice only] Back it up! [the footage is rewound to the part where ManBearPig attacks the tech in blue dress shirt, then stopped.] Look! [points to ManBearPig] Right there! [the tape plays normally] See that?! [the tape stops again where the lead tech is ripped in two] What does that look like to you?! It's ManBearPig! [now onscreen wearing his Nobel Prize medallion] I told you it was real! [three officials watch him from a table in his office] Look again! [fast forwards, then stops when ManBearPig picks up Kyle] There! half man, half bear, and half pig! Do you see it?!
Official 1
Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore.
Al Gore
Something big is going on, and the American people need to know what! I'm off! [makes like he's flying away like Superman]
Washington D.C. Memorial Hospital, day. Kyle is resting in a room, and his doctor is in the hallway talking to another doctor.
Doctor
He's recovering, but there's been some trauma to his brain. The boy says he's been hearing imaginary voices.
Kyle's room. A closeup of him in bed
Stan
[in Kyle's head] Hello? [Kyle's eyes open and blink] Hello? Anybody? [Kyle's eyes dart around]
Kyle
Stan? [sits up and looks around]
Stan
Hello?
Kyle
Stan?
Cartman
[comes in smiling with a covered platter on a food cart] Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
Kyle
Cartman, what's happened?
Cartman
What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
Kyle
No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
Cartman
[smiles] You just rest, Kyle. [takes the lid off the platter] Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry- [suddenly pondering] but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle? [taps his chin] What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream, [real softly] let's see
Kyle
Arh!
Cartman
Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle? [turns towards the sundae] What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right! [faces Kyle with a determined face] My balls!
Kyle
Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
Cartman
Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now. [takes off his cap and begins to pull out yet another costume] So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
Kyle
Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
Cartman
[now in papal robes] Don't try to change the subject, Kyle. [puts on the papal tiara and pulls the camera and its tripod into place] You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. [closes his eyes and smiles]
Castle Sunshine. Aslan stands guard on a bridge overlooking the fields outside the castle.
Jesus
[arriving with Perseus and the Lollipop King] Aslan, the evil characters are almost here!
Aslan
Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!
Butters
What powers? Ah I don't understand.
Gandalf
You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here.
Butters
I c-I can?
Aslan
Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
Butters
How?
Glinda
You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else.
Butters
How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
Luke Skywalker
Think only of one thing. Imagine it. Believe in it.
Gandalf
Whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be. [Butters closes his eyes to focus, and soon something appears before him. He opens his eyes and sees his father]
Steven
[arms akimbo] Butters! [Butters cowers in fear] You are grounded, mister! You hear me?! [suddenly with a deformed leg, elfin ears, horns, and claws instead of fingers, and a deep voice] Grounded!
Butters
[runs around in circles and then shakes his head is disbelief] AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! [Steven vanishes]
Aslan
[in Butters' face] What are you doing?! We need Santa!
Butters
I'm trying!
Wonder Woman
[arrives and kneels down next to him] Come on, kid, imagine Santa! Believe in Santa!
Zeus
You must believe in Santa!
Aslan
BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!
Butters
GAA HAA!
Kyle's hospital room. Cartman has called in some workers to install a photo studio, consisting of a blue background with clouds, and a small platform with a throne on it. On the right arm rest sits the sundae. Two spotlights and light reflectors round out the setup. Cartman tests a remote control for the camera, and it works.
Cartman
Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
Kyle
Cartman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
Channel 5 Breaking News.
Anchorman
A new terrorist attack seems to have taken place. This time, in our imagination. [the footage of ManBearPig's killer rampage is shown, with the dialog cut out] Al Gore brought this video to the public's attention, sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on.
Pentagon Press Conference.
General Deckter
We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild.
Reporter 1
Our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told?!
General Deckter
By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.
Reporter 2
Is nuking our imagination really prudent?
Reporter 3
Aren't there other, more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control?
Reporter 4
Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the-
General Deckter
We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!
Reporter 5
...A-ooch
Channel 5 Breaking News.
Anchorman
The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them.
A protest in Washington D.C..
Hippie 1
That's bullcrap, man! You can't nuke our imagination!
Hippie 2
Don't nuke our imagination bro! WOOO!
Channel 5 Breaking News, commentary.
Anchorman
Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination?
Mike
Uh clearly they don't, Steven, and they're gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters are real. I cite a famous case of Cartman v. Broflovski in which a U.S. court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun.
Anchorman
Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.
Mike
That's right, Steven, yeah.
Kyle's hospital room. Kyle keeps watching. Cartman continues his preparations
Kyle
Oh for the love of God!
Stan
Hello? Can anybody hear me?
Kyle
Stan! Dude, is that you?
Stan
Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
Kyle
No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
Stan
...Oh that makes sense.
Kyle
Dude, what's happening?
Stan
[walking down the rainbow road] I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye. [some moaning horns are heard] Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
The battlefield. The two sides appear, approaching each other. A man in only striped pants and shoes plays a horn
Lollipop King
The evil characters are here. [Jesus and Robin Hood join him, Jesus ready to fight with his sword]
Jesus
There are so many of them. HAAAAA! [lifts his sword to strike position as the other good characters crowd in. The two sides start fighting, and Waldo is impaled by both sides]
Jesus takes on Pinhead and decapitates him. As the battle rages, the six remaining Council members watch along with Butters
Aslan
There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!
Butters
Santa. Saaanta.
Luke Skywalker
Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard.
Butters
Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! [Poof! Santa appears, but he's horribly deformed. The toys in his toy sack are deformed as well. Butters screams and turns away]
Kyle's hospital room. Cartman is now on the throne, and Kevin is behind the camera
Cartman
How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
Anchorman
[everyone turns to watch the TV] A shocking new development in the nuking of imagination!
The Supreme Court, outside.
Chief Justice
The Supreme Court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially not real, and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them.
General Deckter
Thank you.
Kyle
Oh no.
Chief Justice
This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case.
Cartman
...What?
Steven
So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling "Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway."
Stan
Kyle? What's happening?
Kyle
The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
Stan
What?! You can't let them do that!
Kyle
What am I supposed to do?
Stan
Dude you have to stall them! [Kyle doesn't look too sure] Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
Kyle
Stan? Stan?? [gets out of bed and puts on his clothes]
Cartman
Where are you going?!
Kyle
I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
Cartman
Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
Kyle
No, I don't! The decision was overturned. [walks out of the room]
Cartman
[follows him out and watches him walk away] We had a DEAL KYLE!
Kyle
[walking towards the entrance] Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
Cartman
IT ISN'T OVER!! [Kyle turns to face him] It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
Castle Sunshine. The battle rages on. Popeye punches Akuma away, then punches Khan away. Darth Maul whips out his double-ended light saber, but Popeye disarms him and punches him away. Morpehus lands a kick on Freddy Krueger.
Morpheus
[calling out to the Council members on the bridge] I need more spinach for Popeye! [Freddy gets up and swipes at him, sending him into the air and onto his back. A Tron soldier dispatches Jason Voorhees with a swing of his spear]
Tron Soldier
I-ee got one. I got him. [the Woodland Critters approach]
Beary Bear
Hey there. [the soldier turns around and Bear Bear blows his head apart with two laser beam blasts from his eyes. The Woodland Critters cheer him on. ]
Icarus
[flying in from the battlefield, lands on the bridge] We're losing the battle! There are simply too many of them!
Aslan
Then the day is lost.
Wonder Woman
Wait! Aslan, look! [Aslan looks over. Butters is thinking hard again, and Santa returns, as normal as he ever was. The Council members draw closer to Butters]
Santa
What? What happened?
Luke Skywalker
You did it, kid!
Aslan
Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!
Santa
Huh? [discerns the situation] Oh, all right. [grabs a golden axe and leaps over the wall] Make way for Santa! [lands on the field below, then swings the axe at the Minotaur, who falls down. The axe stays buried in the ribs]
Aslan
Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!
The Pentagon, day. Kyle arrives at a parking gate. Two armed guards are there, and three more guards are in the background in front of an entrance.
Guard 2
[sees Kyle and aims his gun at him] This area is restricted, little boy.
Kyle
Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
Guard 2
Get behind the line with the other protesters! [Kyle looks, and it's the same group he saw on television moments before]
Hippie 3
No nukes in our imagination, bro! Wooo! [the other hippies cheer him on]
Kyle
Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
Guard 2
You pot-smokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here, so back off!
Hippie 4
Stop that nuke!
Hippies
Stop that nuke!
Hippies and Kyle
Stop that nuke! [Al Gore appears out of nowhere, making like he's Superman about to land]
Al Gore
What's going on here? [no one says a word, and he "flies" around a bit more] The military has to do this! It's their only way to kill ManBearPig. ["flies" off]
Castle Sunshine. The battle continues. A pegasus fights a witch while a flying monkey does battle with the flying giraffe. On the bridge, Butters keeps imagining new characters into existence. A yellow furry archer appears and shoots an arrow right off the bat, then fires a second one
Aslan
Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!
Butters
Huwhoa! [Perseus appears on the bridge with a bad wound on his left arm]
Perseus
Aslan! We're losing the battle!
Robin Hood
[with a bleeding wound on his right arm] We managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves, but... now our troops are being shot down by the Cavity Creeps.
Aslan
Cavity Creeps?
Cavity Creeps
[cutting through the field with their cavity drills] We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth!
Wonder Woman
What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?
Perseus
Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.
Aslan
[to Butters] Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel! [Butters thinks, and poof! There's a giant Crest Gel tube of toothpaste with arms and legs. Robin Hood and Perseus escort it to the battlefield]
Robin Hood
Yes!
Gandalf
His powers are getting stronger. We might just have a chance here.
Archangel
Aslan, we've captured a spy! He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest! [down from above comes the archangel with Stan]
Butters
Stan! [points him out to Aslan and walks to him] Hey look, I imagined Stan here!
Stan
No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
Aslan
Project Imagination Doorway? [no one else has a clue either]
Gandalf
Never mind! The battle is almost won! We can deal with him later.
Stan
[stands next to Butters] No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
Luke Skywalker
What?
Butters
Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
Stan
So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
Aslan
We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!
Stan
The Chosen One?
Butters
Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.
The portal at the Pentagon. The nuclear warhead is ready to be shot in.
Computer
[a female voice] Missile launch sequence initiated.
General Deckter
All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books.
Tech 1
Sir, we have a security breach!
General Deckter
What?!
Tech 3
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
General Deckter
Sector 2? [The large window opposite the portal had been patched up, but cracks remain. Cartman crashes through the large window again, reversing the patches, and again lands on his back.]
Cartman
[gets up] What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
General Deckter
What?
Cartman
You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
Lab Tech
Imaginary things are things made up by people, like Santa and Rudolph.
Tom
Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus.
Tech 1
Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.
Tom
Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!
Tech 7
It's possible that hell is also imaginary.
Tech 2
Uh so then, we're about to nuke hell... that's a good thing, right?
Personnel
[not all at once] Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah.
Lab Tech
What if heaven is imaginary? We'd be nuking heaven.
Tech 3
Yeah, but it wouldn't be real.
Lab Tech 2
So it'd be all right.
Cartman
Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
Tom
Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!
Tech 3
Well then, what about Buddha?
Tom
Well of course he's imaginary!
Lab Tech 3
Awww, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom.
Tech 7
Am I real?
General Deckter
All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!
Cartman
[two guards haul him away] No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
The Mall, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, day. Kyle sits on some steps moping.
Stan
[in Kyle's imagination] Kyle? Kyle, what happened?
Kyle
Nothing.
Stan
What??
Kyle
[stands up and moves around] Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! [a man walking by looks at him for a few seconds]
Stan
Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
Kyle
They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
Stan
Well you have to convince them they are real!
Kyle
No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
Stan
Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?! [Kyle sighs] Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
Kyle
Huh? [POV changes. The White House is seen in the distance]
Jesus
Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.
Kyle
Oh boy...
Jesus
What seems to be the problem, my child?
Kyle
Jesus, I can't do anything. [a man walking down the steps stops to look, then continues walking.] I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government. [Jesus falls silent] Uh, hello? Jesus?
Luke Skywalker
No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.
Kyle
[dejected] Aah.
Luke Skywalker
Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?
Kyle
Yeah, I guess.
Luke Skywalker
Uh okay, now, now hold on, because Superman is here and he wants to say something. [Kyle rolls his eyes around]
Superman
Kyle, this is Superman.
Kyle
Hi Superman.
Superman
I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it.
Kyle
[subdued] I know.
Superman
You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you.
Kyle
Oh God...
Superman
Yes, God is here too. He's gonna talk to you right after Captain Crunch.
Castle Sunshine. The battle rages on. Jesus fights a Xenomorph, but to no effect
Jesus
Popeye, I need some help here! [a donkey wearing a sombrero walks by shooting at the Pac-Man monsters]
Lollipop King
[being choked by an Imperial Stormtrooper] Popeye is being killed by Christmas Critters. [sure enough, the Critters hump on Popeye as Foxy Fox pisses on his face]
Popeye
Gaw guguh, getskug off of me!
Beary Bear
[sees something and leaves the other Critters] Hey, what is that?
the battle ceases as Butters floats through inside a bubble, then resumes after he's gone
Butters
More spinach for Popeye! [ten cans of spinach appear before Popeye in a pyramid] Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
Jesus
[his sword turns into an M60 and the Xenomorph cowers] All right!
Aslan
[on the bridge] The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!
The portal at the Pentagon. Just a little longer...
Computer
Missile launch in one minute.
Cartman
Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
General Deckter
Prepare for launch...
Tech 1
Sir, we have a security breach!
General Deckter
What?!
Tech 3
There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
General Deckter
Sector 2? [Kyle crashes through the part of the large window that was left intact and lands on his back. Cartman turns around]
Cartman
Kyle?
General Deckter
The hell are you doing back here?!
Kyle
Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
General Deckter
Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!
Kyle
You have to stop!
General Deckter
If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?
Kyle
Because I- [catches himself] I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of "real." They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. [Cartman begins a slow clap, then speeds it up. The techs in the room join in and soon everyone is applauding Kyle's speech]
General Deckter
Abort the sequence. [a tech flips the switch and the power to the missile is cut. The missile lowers to a resting state]
Cartman
So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. [gloats]
Kyle
Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls, [forces Cartman to face him] you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am [jab] never going to suck your balls, [jab] never! So [jab] there!
Al Gore
[walking through the sliding doors] What happened?! Why hasn't the missile gone off?!
General Deckter
There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.
Al Gore
[moves towards the switch] No! ManBearPig has to die! [presses buttons randomly]
Tech 3
Oh Jesus no! [the portal activates and begins sucking everyone and everything into Imaginationland, including Cartman and Kyle... and the missile]
Imaginationland, the battlefield outside Castle Sunshine.
Lollipop King
That's it, Aslan! The evil characters have fled!
Aslan
The day is ours! [screams are heard and bodies fall from the sky. Aslan and the others look up. Many of them land on the battlefield. Kyle lands on the bridge, face down]
Stan
[approaches] Kyle!
Butters
[approaches Cartman on the battlefield] Fellas! Where'd you come from? [a whistling sound is heard and everyone looks up]
Zeus
What is that? [the missile comes down from the sky and blows up on the battlefield, killing everyone. The screen fills up with white ash. Moments later, Butters digs himself out of the ash and dusts himself off. He looks around and walks off to his left.]
Butters
Huh... [with nothing but white around, he concentrates real hard and soon Imaginationland returns. The Barrier repairs itself, and all the imaginary characters reappear]
Jesus
He did it!
Fanciful Mayor
[poof] Oh look, I'm back!
Luke Skywalker
Nice going, kid. [the other good imaginary characters congratulate him]
Fanciful Mayor
The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again.
Stan
Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
Butters
Well I just... used my imagination.
All
Awwww [everyone has a good laugh]
Cartman
You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality. [he begins to think hard, and an imaginary version of himself appears, wearing the crown and robe from before.] Why look, it's me. And... [thinks again, and an imaginary Kyle appears] And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? [the imaginary Kyle drops out of view]
Kyle
Cartman, don't!
Cartman
O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! [the imaginary Cartman is a little shocked]
Stan
Dude.
Lollipop King
Oh my God.
Cartman
O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
Kyle
I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
Cartman
No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
General Deckter
That's true. You did.
Cartman
Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. [everyone but Kyle laughs]
Santa
Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.
Kyle
I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
Fanciful Mayor
Whatever you imagine to be real, is real. [everyone cheers that remark]
Butters' room, morning. He's asleep.
Steven
Butters? [Butters opens his eyes] Butters!
Butters
[sits up] A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
Steven
Come on, Butters, time to get up. [walks in with newspaper in hand]
Butters
Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
Steven
You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!
Linda
You are grounded, mister!
Butters
[dejected] Ohhh. [becomes determined] Wait, I'm not grounded.
Steven
Oh yes you are!
Butters
Oh yeah? [focuses real hard, then opens his eyes]
Steven
That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded! [backs out of the room. He and Linda leave, closing the door behind them]
Butters
[thinks a bit, then lies down again] Ahhh shit.
End of Imaginationland, Episode III

Guitar Queer-O
Stan's house, day. In the living room, Stan and Kyle stand before the TV with guitar controllers in their hands. Nine boys from class watch them from the sofa and the floor. A game starts up. Stan and Kyle immediately begin to play and the other boys begin to cheer them on. The song playing is "Wayward Son"
Cartman
Stan, you guys are good! [Stan and Kyle more their right arms around during a power chord, then quickly return to playing. The score is 15,594 points and climbs quickly. Randy watches from the kitchen doorway]
The kitchen. Sharon is washing dishes. Randy turns and walks towards her.
Randy
[sounding tired] Sharon, what are the boys doing?
Sharon
Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.
Randy
They can play guitar now?
Sharon
No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.
Randy
Ohhh.
Sharon
If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.
Randy
Hey yeah...
The living room. The round ends and the boys cheer.
Stan
Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! [a shot of the cheering CG crowd on the TV]
Randy
[walks up to Stan] So you boys like this music, huh?
Kyle
Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
Butters
Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
Randy
<ï>Well you kids wanna see something really cool? [the boys pay attention] Check this out. [walks away and picks up an electric guitar, and plugs in the amplifier. He puts his right foot on top of the amplifier and begins to play "Wayward Son" a half-step up.]
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-
</ï>

Stan
[irritated, interrupting] Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!
Randy
[brightly] I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
Cartman
Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
Stan
Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.
Randy
But... But this is real.
Cartman
Real guitars are for old people.
Craig
Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. [Randy stands there a few seconds, disappointed that the boys aren't interested. He takes off the guitar, leans it against the amplifier, and walks away.]
Stan
[turns back to the TV] Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. [the game starts up with a new song, and the boys behind them begin to cheer again]
Stan's house, night. Once everyone's asleep, Randy sneaks downstairs towards the couch. He looks around to make sure no one else is awake and waiting for him. He reaches the couch and picks up a controller, playing it a bit to start the game.
M.C.
Are you ready to rock? ["Wayward Son" begins to play from the top, and Randy begins to move, slowly raising his right hand into a victory sign, then swinging his arm all the way around a few times]
Kansas
<ï>
"Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more"
[the first guitar solo follows and Randy is playing terribly. The video crowd begins to boo him.]</ï>

M.C.
Game over! You suck! [the words are displayed onscreen. Randy takes off the controller, sets it on the ground, and walks back to bed, leaving the TV on with the video crowd still booing him.]
Stan's house, next day. The boys are back at Stan's house watching another round of Guitar Hero. "Wayward Son" gives way to another song.
Butters
They're gonna do it!
Cartman
[so relaxed his fat blocks his chin from view] Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
Kyle
Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. [the points pile up and they near 100,000. After a final flourish, their readouts combine into one, showing 100,000 points. The boys congratulate Stan and Kyle]
M.C
You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars!
Stan
Dude, we are total rock stars now!
Randy
[walks in with beer and slurred speech] You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! [the doorbell rings]
Stan
[takes off his controller and goes to answer the door] Hang on.
Man
Stan Marsh?
Stan
Yeah?
Man
I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
Stan
Yeah, we did. [smiles]
Mr. Kincade
I'm impressed. [steps inside and gives him a business card] And I'd like to be your manager.
Stan
Wow, really?? [smiles an open smile] Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
Randy
No way!
Kyle
For reals? [smiles]
Mr. Kincade
Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points.
Stan
That'd be awesome!
Mr. Kincade
So, we're in business then? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then grin as "Wayward Son" plays]
A producer's office, day. Mr. Kincade is snapping his fngers to "Wayward Son" as a producer listens. Stan and Kyle watch him, then Stan looks at Kyle. Kyle grimaces.
Mr. Kincade
Well, what do you think?
Producer
I like it. That's these boys playing?
Mr. Kincade
[stops the tape] No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.
Producer
That's pretty Goddamned impressive. [rises and serves himself a drink] Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. [Stan and Kyle smile to this news as Mr. Kincaid stands behind them]
Mr. Kincade
[pumps his fist] Yes! You did it, boys.
Producer
Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?
Stan, Kyle
Cool! [smile openly]
The producer's mansion, night. Limos pull into the circular driveway in front of the mansion, drop off guests, and pull away. Inside is a large crowd of local celebrities. In the pool, two topless women splash each other with water and giggle. One blond celebrity is snorting a mountain of coke
Stan
Wow, this is a huge party.
Producer
Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.
Stan
Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! [Ron Zappolo is shown - an elderly gent with gray hair and mustache]
Kyle
Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. [Jabs is shown with a white tiger on his lap and two women around him]
Producer
Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero. [ooo's and applause follow. Stan and Kyle grin] Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.
Stan
Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there! [a football player wearing #6 is shown] Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
Kyle
Oh my God!
Producer
Would you boys like to meet him?
Stan
Are you serious??
Producer
Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
Jay
Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.
Stan
Nice to meet you! [grins] I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
Jay
[a bit bothered] Thanks...
Guest
Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?
Producer
You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
Kyle
Do we? He's a legend!
Producer
You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.
Tom Shane
That, would be impressive.
Kyle
[takes Stan aside] Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
Stan
Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
Stan's house, day. Mr. Kincade rocks out on the couch watching Stan and Kyle play Guitar Hero. The boys hit 152,626 points
M.C.
You Rock!
Mr. Kincade
[clapping] All right, nice rehearsal, boys.
Kyle
D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
Stan
Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.
Mr. Kincade
That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. [an assistant dressed in jogging outfit joins him behind Kyle]
Kyle
Oh, okay. Cool. [takes off his controller and follows Jim out]
Mr. Kincade
[sighs] You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.
Stan
Really? That'd be sweet.
Mr. Kincade
[turns around and points to Stan] I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back.
Stan
What, you mean, Kyle?
Mr. Kincade
Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.
Stan
But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
Mr. Kincade
[crosses his arms] Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowheres. Just listen to that video crowd. [a shot of the video crowd cheering] I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings.
Café Monet, day. Mr. Kincade and Stan are outside at a table sipping coffee.
Mr. Kincade
You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course. [sees someone] Ah, Thad! [a boy about Stan's age approaches the table and takes a seat. He wears a controller on his back] Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.
Thad
Sup? [an air of superiority is suggested by his tilting his head back]
Mr. Kincade
That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad? [puffs on a cigar]
Thad
Yup.
Mr. Kincade
He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.
Stan
Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
Mr. Kincade
Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do. [Thad stands on his chair, swings his controller around, and puts his right foot on the table.] Check this out. [All that is heard are the clicks of plastic on plastic] Pretty damn good, huh?
Stan
Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? [Thad stops and launches into that song]
Mr. Kincade
Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.
Male Diner
Ohoh, I love this song. [the other diners seem to understand the song the clicks are supposed to be making and begin to clap]
Stan's house, later. Guitar Hero starts up and the boys are gathered near the couch watching Stan and... Thad. A song comes on and Stan and Thad begin to play. The boys cheer them on as the score nears 500,000
Butters
Wow wee, look at him go!
Kyle
[enters the house] Hey dude, how'd it-? [he has his new controller, but he's dismayed at what he sees. The boys look at him and the game is shut off]
Stan
...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.
Butters
[into his hands, in a low hoarse voice.] Uh ohhh.
Kyle
[walks up to Stan] Who is this?
Stan
This is um, Thad Jarvis.
Thad
Sup?
Kyle
Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
Stan
Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
Kyle
But it's our game. We bought it together.
Stan
I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
Kyle
Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
Stan
Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
Cartman
Oh my God this is so awesome.
Stan
You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
Kyle
I have been sick!
Stan
Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
Kyle
[stunned for a few seconds] I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. [drops his controller next to Stan and walks out of the house, closing the door behind him]
Craig
Dude, this game rules.
Stan
Let's just do this, all right? [a new round begins and Stan and Thad resume playing]
EV Games. Guitar Hero advertising is plastered all over the windows. Stan enters the store. He walks over to the magazine rack and begins browsing
Brett
Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?
Stan
It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
Brett
Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress.
Stan
[approaches the counter with a Guitar Hero game guide] Huh?
Brett
Have you ever heard of... [pulls out a different game from under the counter] Heroin Hero?
Stan
Hero-Heroin Hero?
Brett
Ihit's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.
Stan
And there's no score? No crowds?
Brett
[his voice gets soft and mellow as he speaks] No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.
Stan's house, day. He's playing Heroin Hero, which just consists of his character shooting heroin into his right arm. Each shot moves him forward a few steps, but he's no closer to the dragon.
The Dragon
Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.
Stan
[playing quietly] Dude, this is awesome.
Gamecraft Arcade, day. Stan and Thad are at the arcade version of Guitar Hero; Stan is showing frustration. The song they're playing to is "I Wanna Be Sedated". Mr. Kincaid watches them as the producer approaches
Producer
How are they coming?
Mr. Kincade
No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days
Mr. Hart
They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out. [walks away. On the game screen, Stan's character is missing his notes and flailing about]
Stan
Ugh. Damint.
Thad
Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?
Stan
[frustrated] Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play! [misses some more notes] No no, you know what?! Screw this! [the music stops] I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
Mr. Kincade
Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play.
Stan
Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
Thad
No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.
Stan
Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
Mr. Kincade
Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?
Stan
We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
Thad
Yeah? Well how about this one? I quite. [drops his controller] I quit I quit I quit. [turns around and walks away] I quit I quit I quit. I quit. I quit I quit.
Stan
You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
Mr. Kincade
Stan, what is the matter with you?
Stan
I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! [Mr. Kincaid notices that Stan's tote bag is open and looks inside. He pulls out Heroin Hero]
Mr. Kincade
What is this?
Stan
Man...
Mr. Kincade
Are you playing Heroin Hero?
Stan
Just, just a little.
Mr. Kincade
No! [stands up] Nobody plays Heroin Hero just a little! You know, you never catch the dragon!
Stan
I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
Mr. Kincade
You'd better pull your act together, because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!
Stan
No problem.
A bowling alley, day. The exterior is a bit run-down, with strips of plastic pulling away from the roof. A sign by the street has "WE HAVE GUITAR HERO" on it, the R falling off. "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" plays. Inside, some people are bowling while others sit at tables being depressed. The camera rests on Kyle playing along on his guitar controller. Two kids walk up to Kyle. The place is called Mick's Lanes
Older Boy
Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!
Kyle
I'm not done yet.
Younger Boy
Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?
Kyle
No. You're thinking of somebody else.
Younger Boy
Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points.
Older Boy
How come you're playing here now?
Kyle
Look, just go ahead and play, alright? [gets off the stool and walks away] Leave me alone. [walks up to the bar and takes a seat] Can I get a Fresca, please?
Mick
You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this.
Kyle
Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
Mick
Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free.
Kyle
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
Mick
Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all.
Kyle
Thanks, Mick.
Heroin Hero, onscreen at Stan's house, day.
The Dragon
Catch me. Come on, catch me. [Stan is passed out on the couch with snacks all around him. Some knocks and the doorbell are heard, but Stan doesn't move] What's wrong? Follow me. Come on. [The door opens and Mr. Kincaid comes in]
Mr. Kincade
Marsh? Stan, you got- [notices Stan passed out] Oh my God! [runs over to him and shakes him hard] Get up, Stan! Wake up!
Stan
Huh? What, uh?
Mr. Kincade
You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!
Stan
The dragon. Where did it go?
Mr. Kincade
[slaps Stan twice across the face] You've gotta pull it together! [shakes him hard again, then sees a glass of water nearby and throws the water at him, them shakes him hard again] Pull it together, Goddammit!
Gamecraft Arcade, night. The boys are there waiting for Stan to start playing. A couple stands behind them waiting as well.
Mr. Kincade
Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom. [the boys cheer Stan on.]
Token
Go Stan!
Cartman
All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
Token
Yeah, Stan!
Craig
Dude, what's the matter with him?
Butters
He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero. [Stan staggers slowly] Come on, Stan! You got it!
Mr. Kincade
Goddamnit, he's a mess! [Stan is moving around, but he's missing all the notes]
Craig
Oh man, I can't watch this.
Mr. Kincade
What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! [a shot of the video crowd booing]
Cartman
Come on guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys leave, as to the couples and other spectators, leaving Stan alone with Mr. Kincade. Mr. Hart approaches Mr. Kincade.]
Mr. Hart
The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed. [walks away. Stan stumbles and finally falls face first, throwing up]
Mr. Kincade
You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you! [walks away. More shots of the video crowd booing. Stan looks at the crowd and begins seeing double]
EV Games, day. Brett the clerk is reading a magazine. Stan walks in, his head hanging real low, and walks to a game stand
Brett
There he is! So, did you break a million yet?
Stan
No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
Brett
Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top.
Stan
I just wanna find something else to play.
Brett
Have you played... [whips out a new game] Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it.
Stan
I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
Brett
Sssure kid. Sure. [brings out a Cross Country Cruiser game]
Stan's house, day. He's now playing Cross Country Cruiser. A radio is next to him, and in it a song ends.
Radio Host
All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero. [Stan is startled] Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I Guess... they're not playing the game anymore.
"Wayward Son" begins to play and Stan gets immersed in the game. A shot of Stan and Kyle playing Guitar Hero floats by. Stan then steps on the brake, stopping his video car. He thinks hard about what to do next. After a few seconds, a look of determination shows up and he goes into reverse, looking back over his shoulder as if he were driving a real car.
Mick's Bowling Lanes, day. The sign now says: KILE BARFFLOSKI ON GUITAR HERO. Inside, Kyle is at the Guitar Hero setup playing along to another song.
Skid Row
<ï>
"Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
[Stan walks in and approaches Kyle. Kyle sees him and turns his back to him]
And when you needed me I came through"</ï>

Stan
Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
Kyle
What are you doing here? ["I paint a picture of the days gone by"]
Stan
Please, ih ih, it won't take long.
Kyle
Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. ["When love went blind and you would make me see." Kyle walks over to the bar and serves himself some Fresca]
Stan
I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. ["I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes"]
Kyle
Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! ["So that I knew you were there for me"]
Stan
Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
Kyle
Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! ["Time after time you were there for me"]
Stan
That isn't it at all. ["Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand"]
Kyle
You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! ["Love letters in the sand - I remember you"]
Stan
I know. I need you. [Kyle glances over his shoulder, then turns around to face Stan] I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that... [turns around and face Kyle] ...with my best friend.
Kyle
It was pretty fun, wasn't it?
Stan
[awkwardly] Yeah.
Kyle
Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
Stan
I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
Kyle
I don't really see the fun in... [turns around with fire in his eyes] ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
Stan
What, you mean it?
Kyle
I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
Stan
[pats Kyle on the shoulder] Then let's go, dude! [walks forward. Kyle follows.]
Kyle
[stops abruptly] Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here. [turns around and face Mick] Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
Mick
Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?
Kyle
Thanks, Mick! [turns left and walks out. Stan follows him.]
Stan's house, day. Stan and Kyle walk up to Stan's house. Stan opens the door and they enter the living room
Stan
All right, dude, let's do this. [Kyle's jaw drops and Stan is annoyed] What the hell? [what greets them is Randy on the couch in his underwear. Around him are a pizza slice, a bucket of chicken, a case of S'mores Schnapps, and other items. Randy is playing Heroin Hero]
Randy
Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.
The Dragon
Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on.
Stan
Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!
Randy
Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.
The Dragon
Hehe, you almost caught me.
Stan
No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
Randy
[sits up] I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
Stan
You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! [turns off the console]
Randy
NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
Stan
Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
The neighborhood park. Cartman, Kenny, Clyde, Craig, and Token are playing basketball. Craig has the ball and shoots at the basket. The shot is good.
Cartman
Stop cheating, Craig! [pushes Craig from behind]
Craig
How was that cheating!
Cartman
'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
Butters
Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
Cartman
What?
Butters
Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! [Butters runs back. After some thought, the other boys run after him]
The Boys
Oh, let's go! Cone on, let's go!
Stan's house, day. Stan and Kyle are playing again. Kevin, Jimmy, and a third boy are already present. The other boys enter and jimmy makes room for them to see the action
Butters
They're gonna do it! [they finally break the million]
Craig
They did it!
Jimmy
Oh my sweet J-Jesus!
M.C.
You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach one million points! Congratulations! You. Are. FAGS. [the video crowd cheers]
Stan
That's it?
Kyle
Goddammit! God dammit! [walks away pissed off. Stan takes off his controller and looks at it, drops it to the floor, and follows after Kyle]
Cartman
Butters, you wanna play me next? [picks up Stan's controller and puts it on]
Butters
Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. [picks up Kyle's controller and puts it on, and both of them get to playing.]
End of Guitar Queer-O

The List
The school cafeteria. It looks like it's been remodeled. At the table at center sit Kyle, Stan, Craig, Kenny, Cartman, Clyde, and Token.
Butters
[runs towards the table breathlessly] Fellas! Fellas! It's- Oh my god! You're not gonna believe this!
Stan
Dude, Butters, calm down.
Butters
Okay. [takes a gulp of air and looks around] Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
Craig
So who do they say is the cutest?
Butters
I dunno.
Token
Who do they say is the ugliest?
Butters
I don't know. I-it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. [turns around and looks at them. The other boys look as well. Nearby, the girls chat among themselves, notice the boys, then laugh. Bebe holds up a notebook]
Cartman
[mad] They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
Stan
Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
Clyde
If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
Kyle
You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
Cartman
[with a double cheeseburger in his left hand] Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
Craig
You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
Cartman
Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
Craig
You don't think they put the fat tub of lard at the bottom?
Cartman
No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor.
Kenny
(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
Cartman
Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
Butters
You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
Kyle
You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! [the boys look at each other for a few seconds]
The hallway, after lunch. Bebe's at her locker. Cartman leads a small group of boys to her.
Cartman
All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
Bebe
[turns her head to look at him] What?
Cartman
You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
Bebe
That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
Cartman
Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him?
Bebe
I'm not... [slams her locker door shut] telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! [sticks her tongue out and blows a raspberry at him, then walks away]
Cartman:
[blows a strong raspberry back and flips her off] Fuck you, Bebe! Fuck it, bitch!
Butters
[disappointed] Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
Cartman
Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them.
Cartman's house, after school. In his basement, he shares his plan with some of the other fourth grade boys.
Cartman
All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right? She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her. [points to a chalkboard with his plan on it] This is what I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail". [a map with routes of the plan laid out]
Butters
[happily taking notes] Neat-o!
Cartman
At 1 PM tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here. [upper center part of the map] When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
Butters
[cheerfully] Okay!
Cartman
Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
South Park Elementary, day. Nelly walks down the hall as the 1 PM bell rings. As she walks, Craig blows through a paper bullhorn. Nelly looks over her right shoulder and Butters runs up and kicks her in the groin.
Nelly
Ow! What'dja do that for?! [Butters looks down and kicks her in the groin again] Hey, what's your problem, asshole?! [Butters is stunned that his kicks have no effect on her]
Cartman
Bail, bail! [he and Kenny take off]
Cartman's house, after school. He stands next to his revised plan, "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time".
Cartman
Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
Butters
[shown with a black right eye and his right arm in a sling] They sure don't.
Cartman
Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call "Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
Butters
You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
Cartman
Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! [continues]
South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings. Token is walking down the hall when Kenny, Cartman, Craig and Butters run past him. He and the other kids in the hall look on.
Cartman
We got it! We got it! [next shot is of Stan at his locker as Craig runs by]
Craig
We got the list from the girls! [the other boys take pursuit: Stan, Token, Jimmy, Clyde, Tweek, Bill, and two others. Two sixth graders and some kindergartners watch from the far end of the hall]
Nelly
[chasing after the boys] Give that back you dirty buttholes! [the boys run into the boys' room]
Cartman
Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! [Kyle is washing his hands, but he turns to see what's going on]
Clyde
All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!
A Boy
Hurry hurry!
Craig
Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?
Clyde
What number am I on?
A Boy
Is it set up?
Stan
It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
Clyde
Me? [smiles] I'm the cutest? [grins]
Stan
And then Token, and then me.
Token
I'm number two? Wow.
Butters
[making his way to the front] Come on, let me see! Let me see! [looks at the list and begins to scan it for his own name, then finds it] Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! [runs out of the bathroom as a few boys wonder why he's so happy about it]
Craig
Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! [he's #12 while Cartman is #15]
Cartman
What?! That's bullcrap! [Kenny moves up past Cartman and looks for his name. He finds himself at #7]
Kenny
(Woohoo!) [moves off]
Kyle
Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and... [finds himself at #16, the last one on the list. His head drops a little] Me?
Cartman
You're last, dude! [laughs heartily]
Kyle
No way.
Cartman
Yes way! Check it out! [laughs heartily]
Stan
Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
Cartman
So? I'm hotter than Kyle. [makes his way through the crowd and out of the bathroom] I'm better looking than Kyyyle! [the other boys join him out except for Stan and Kyle] Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
Kyle
I'm last? Last?
Stan
Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?
Kyle
I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
Stan
Who cares what dumb girls think, right? [realizes there's no consolation now and walks away. Kyle stays there looking at the list. Alone. All alone. All alone in the boys' room]
Butters' house, day. He makes it home and runs into the kitchen. In the living room are three pairs of snow boots.
Butters
Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
Stephen
[holding a smoking pipe with his right hand and reading the Denver Post] Well good for you, Butters.
Linda
Way to go, champ.
Butters
Whoopie! [flies off to his room]
Stephen
Well, guess we don't have to ground him.
Kyle's house, evening. The family's at dinner, but Kyle isn't eating. He's still depressed.
Sheila
Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
Kyle
The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
Sheila
What? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
Kyle
Look, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I-I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
Sheila
You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. [Gerald looks at Kyle and flashes a smile]
Kyle
Oh God! I do?
Gerald
But he has his mother's nose.
Kyle
[slaps both hands on his own nose] Ah!
Sheila
Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
Kyle
Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no? [Ike looks at him, then at their parents, then back at him. Kyle takes this to mean yes, and so leaves his chair] You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
Sheila
Kyle, come back here! [a door slams shut]
Kyle's bedroom, night. Kyle is in his pajamas, in his bed, under the covers. He still can't get over the list. He hears a knock at his window and looks over: it's Cartman.
Cartman
I'm better looking than you! [knocks on the window again] The girls think I'm better looking than you, Kyle! [Kyle sighs, stands on his bed, and pulls on a drawstring to close the curtains. Cartman moves with the curtain until he can no longer see inside Kyle's room] Dude, Kyle! Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are! [knocks] Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive! [knocks again. The curtain is fully closed and Kyle goes back to sleep] Kyle?
Clyde's house. He's looking at himself in a full-length mirror in nothing but briefs.
Betsy
[checking in on Clyde] Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed. [Clyde looks at his mom, who closes the door, then turns back to the mirror]
Clyde
[raises his right eyebrow and knits his left one, then strikes a pose] Hey, what's goin' on? [looks at himself from the side] What's goin' on? Hey. [checks out his ass and then strikes another pose] Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.
South Park Elementary, day. Kyle walks down the hall holding his notebook close. The other kids laugh as he walks by. He stops when he sees Clyde testing his moves.
Clyde
Hey, what's goin' on?
Two Girls
Hey Clyde.
Clyde
Hey.
Anne
Hi Clyde.
Clyde
What's goin' on? [Kyle is dismayed, but he hears Butters running up to him]
Butters
[laughing] Hey ugly! [runs off. Kyle then walks forward]
Clyde
[stops him] Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay? [Kyle remains sad] You know, Abraham Lincoln was super ugly too, but look what he accomplished. [Kyle is no happier] Chin up, cowboy. [leaves to talk to a girl nearby] Hey, what's goin' on? [the girl smiles]
Girl
Oh, not much, just hanging around-
Butters
[returns to taunt Kyle some more] Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! [runs off laughing]
Clyde
Butters, that's not cool, man. [takes off after him] He can't help how he looks. [the girl walks away]
Cartman
[walks up] Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right? [Kyle stays mum, as before] Cool. [walks away. A few seconds later, Kyle's eyes pop open]
The school cafeteria, day. Three ugly kids are shown eating slowly - two boys and a girl between them. Across from them are a fat ugly girl and another ugly boy. Kyle walks up and sits between these two.
Blonde Boy
Hey.
Kyle
Hello. [the girl takes a sip of her milk, then lowers the carton]
Bushy Eyebrows Boy
[with bushy eyebrows] Are you going to eat your pickle? [Kyle just picks it up and hands it to him. The boy takes it and starts eating it, slowly]
The playground, later. As the other kids play various games, the five ugly kids and Kyle sit on the steps by an entrance. Butters runs around in his #11 shirt laughing merrily.
Craig
Could somebody toss the football back? It's over there next to the ugly kids. [the ugly kids just watch quietly. Kyle is more and more depressed]
Big-Eared Boy
I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.
Kyle
Yeah.
Big-Eared Boy
Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!
Kyle
[leans away, then stands up] No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
Fat Girl
We're not?
Kyle
No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
Bushy Eyebrows Boy
Hey yeah.
Kyle
[to the girl wearing glasses] Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses. [removes them, and is met with tiny little eyes. The girl smiles after a few seconds] Let's just... put those back on. [puts them back on the girl, goes back to the steps, sits down and buries his head in his arms with a sigh. A few seconds later, Stan walks by and stops. He looks at the group helplessly. A few seconds later, he walks up to the merry-go-round, where Wendy, Lola, and Red are chatting]
Lola
I know, that song is so awesome. [Red notices him]
Stan
Uh, Wendy. Could I talk to you?
Wendy
Of course, Stan. [the other two girls smile]
Stan
Just for a minute. Over here. [takes her aside, to a tree nearby]
Lola
[to Red] You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him?
Wendy
This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
Stan
Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
Wendy
Which one? We make lists all the time.
Stan
The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
Wendy
[walks off a bit] Well, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-
Stan
[walks up next to her] So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
Wendy
Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's not just something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
Stan
Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
Wendy
[thinks for a moment] All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.
The girls' meeting room, day. The room is pink, with pink bows here and there. Lists and drawings are everywhere on the walls. Two tables, each seating seven people, face each other. Between them is a smaller table seating two, and a judge's bench. Wendy is already present with Stan when the other girls file in and take their seats. Bebe is presiding.
Bebe
Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.
Red
If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?
Bebe
Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
Girls
Sunshine.
Lola
Deliberating "Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse"? Millie has the floor.
Millie
If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to submit that [motions to her left] Jennifer's purse is by far the cutest. Definitely cuter than Teresa's.
Blond Girl
I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest.
Bebe
The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
Lola
Sunshine sparkle. Wendy has the floor.
Wendy
If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we... [glances at Stan] That we reopen last week's list for debate.
Girls
[debating] What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding!
Heidi
Is she crazy?
Bebe
All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. [Stan and Wendy walk into the center of the room]
Wendy
Go ahead.
Stan
Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
Red
You thought you should be number one?
Stan
NO.
Bebe
Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
Wendy
He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
Bebe
I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
Girls
Sunshine.
Kyle's house, night. All the lights are out. In his room, Kyle is laying on his stomach and flicks a lighter on, then off, then on again, then off.
Kyle
They all laugh at me! [flicks on] And the girls giggle behind my back! [flicks off] unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
A Voice
Do not burn down the school, Kyle. [Kyle looks around]
Kyle
Who said that?
A Voice
I did. [a body appears in the room to match the voice - it's Abraham Lincoln's glowing ghost] Do you know who I am?
Kyle
Abraham Lincoln?
Abraham Lincoln
I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see. [walks out] I want you to look in here. [they approach a random house and look inside. A bored woman is playing with a pencil and pebble at her small dining table] This woman is Nancy Pinkerton. As a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school. Her life as a youth was filled with praises, and everything being handed to her. Boys told her she was special. She was funny. She was interesting. But that's only because she was hot. It wasn't until she reached age 40, when her looks started to fade, that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special, as a wet carrot. [they leave her as they found her, playing with a pencil, all alone in her dining room. They move on to the next house] This is the home of your new ugly friend, Yamal. [Yamal is shown playing a piano] Because he's ugly, he gets nothing handed to him. He has to work at making something of himself. But that work is gonna pay off when he's an adult. He will have character, something that kids who are hot rarely develop. Like your classmate, Clyde. [they approach Clyde's house. Clyde is all cool laying on his couch talking to someone on the phone] Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special.
Clyde
Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.
Abraham Lincoln
Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed.
Kyle
But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
Abraham Lincoln
You must be patient.
Kyle
Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
Abraham Lincoln
[sighs] Very well.
Kyle's house, later. Lincoln stops in front of it and Kyle gets out.
Abraham Lincoln
Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you.
Kyle
I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
Abraham Lincoln
Well then you're just a fucking asshole! [drives off. Kyle, stunned at that comment, just looks on.]
Wendy's room, night. Stan is on a beanbag chair as Wendy sifts through the lists at her desk.
Wendy
Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something! [Stan gets off the chair and walks up to the desk] Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.
Stan
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Wendy
It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. [they look at each other, smiling]
Red's house, day. Wendy and Stan walk up; Wendy knocks on the door. Red answers.
Red
Oh, hey Wendy.
Wendy
Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
Red
[laughs it off] Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.
Wendy
I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-
Red
[menacingly] All right, you need to stop. Digging. Around, Wendy! [looks around to make sure no one else is listening] You might not like... what you find! [begins to draw close to her] Just back off and stop asking questions! [in Wendy's face] You're getting close to a secret that I don't think you can handle! Let it... go! [backs up into her house and closes the door]
Stan
That didn't sparkle with her, did it?
True-Value Hardware and Home Improvement, day. Someone is purchasing a lot of kerosene, propane, and lighter fluid.
Clerk
[the name tag says Jerry] One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid, [Kyle stands there with determination in his eyes] seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches. [the total is $82.32] Okay, is that everything, little boy?
Kyle
[determined] That should just about do it.
Jerry
Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today?
The girls' meeting room, day. Wendy and Stan are back in the middle of the room. Two girls are before them, behind the small table in front of the bench.
Wendy
Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.
Lola
Why would she do that?
Wendy
Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here. [drops the report on the table] We need to remake that list. [the girls look at the list as Wendy returns to Stan]
Jenny
You just couldn't let it go! [puts her left hand on the report]
Wendy
Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.
Jenny
I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy! [the other girl leaves the table]
Lola
Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father owns the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough.
Wendy
[points at her] You knew!
Lola
[pulls out a folder] Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one!
Wendy
So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
Jenny
Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?!
Wendy
[stunned that her best friend was in on this] No. Not Bebe.
Jenny
She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her.
Stan
What's going on?
Wendy
When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-
Jenny
Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simply generate a new list! "Biggest Liars"! And put you at the top!
Lola
Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!
Wendy
I don't think so! [goes up and kicks Lola in the groin, hard, much to Stan's shock]
Lola
[doubling over, dropping the folder] AAGH!
Wendy
[grabs the folder and runs away] Stan, run!
Stan
Jesus, dude! [runs out after her. The two other girls give chase]
Yamal's house, night. He's playing piano when someone knocks at his door. He goes to answer it.
Stan
[breathlessly] Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
Yamal
[waits a second or two] He's burning down the school.
Wendy
What?
Yamal
He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground.
The night suddenly gets stormy, but it's not cloudy enough to hide the full moon.
Kyle
[on the school roof pouring lighter fluid out] All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
Stan
[he and Wendy reach the roof and run up to him] Kyle! Kyle, don't!
Kyle
Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
Stan
The list was a forgery, Kyle!
Kyle
Huh??
Stan
It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. [a gun is cocked and pops into view, aimed at Wendy]
ScriptDialog

Kyle
Stan, what is going on?!
Stan
It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
Bebe
Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!
Kyle
So what number was I??
Wendy
You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity!
Bebe
Did you see these shoes, Wendy?! [pulls out a new pair of shoes] They're incredible!
Wendy
It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't-[becomes distracted] Oh my God, those are amazing.
Bebe
Right?
Wendy
Is that a lace across the top?
Bebe
No, it's a little strap.
Stan
Wendy!
Wendy
[remembers why she's there] Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!
Bebe
If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! [cocks her gun again]
Kyle
She's gonna kill us?
Wendy:
It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.
Bebe
Oh please, you're lying. [sirens approach and she realizes Wendy wasn't lying. Five police cars converge on the school and cops pour out of them]
Officer
[on the bullhorn] Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it. The list was compromised. Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class. [Wendy takes this opportunity to wrestle the gun away from Bebe. A gunshot goes off and Wendy is stunned]
Stan
Wendy! [she steps back and checks herself for bullet wounds, then finds the gun in her left hand. Bebe looks pained, then she checks herself for bullet wounds. Since they're both uninjured, they look around wondering where the bullet went.]
Kenny's house, night. He and his family are eating breakfast... for dinner. Each of the family members has a bowl of cereal before them. The bullet shoots in through the window, into the back of Kenny's head and out through his forehead. Stuart, his mom, and Kevin jump back in horror as blood splatters on them. They look at each other fearfully.
Kenny
(Aah-) [his head falls into his bowl. A few seconds later, some Pop-Tarts pop out of the toaster.]
The school roof, moments later. Officers are now on the roof and handcuff Bebe.
Bebe
Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.
Officer
You can explain all that downtown. [the cops take her away. Wendy is holding Bebe's shopping bag]
Stan
Here, Kyle. [hands the folder to Kyle. Wendy looks inside the bag - she's got herself some free shoes.] We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. [Kyle holds the folder in his hands, but...]
The school grounds, minutes later. Wendy stands over a garbage can, holding a lighter and torching the folder containing the real list. She flicks the lighter off and drops the burning folder inside the trash can.
Stan
Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
Kyle
I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
Stan
...Abe Lincoln?
Wendy
Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. [smiles]
Stan
Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they? [smiles. As they smile, they look into each other's eyes. Stan begins to get queasy] Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! [throws up on her twice, and she just takes it as she used to do in third grade.]
End of The List

Tonsil Trouble
A close-up of a tongue depressor holding a tongue down, and the sound of a boy going "AHHHHHH." The camera pans out to reveal a dentist looking inside Cartman's mouth. Liane stands nearby, watching. They are all in Cartman's room.
Cartman
AHHHHHH.
Dentist
Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out.
Cartman
What?
Liane
Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?
Dentist
It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!
Cartman
No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
Dentist
Oh, I thought you were a tough kid! You're not scared of hospitals, are you?
Cartman
No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
Dentist
Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either.
Cartman
...Ice cream?
Dentist
It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals.
Liane
What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?
Cartman
Well...you did say free ice cream? [Dentist and Liane laugh]
A shot of Hell's Pass Hospital. Camera cuts to a hospital room where Cartman is asleep in a hospital bed. Liane is sitting by his side, holding his hand and smiling
Liane
Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.
Cartman
[Opening his eyes, blinking a lot] Uh. It's over?
Liane
That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!
Cartman
[Eyes fully open, sitting up] Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
Liane
I'm so proud of you, Eric.
Cartman
All right, so where's my ice cream?
Three doctors enter the room looking very nervous.
Liane
Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.
Cartman
You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
Doctor
No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus.
Liane
...What!?
Cartman
What's that supposed to mean?!
Doctor
During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.
Cartman
I HAVE AIDS?
Doctor
Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry.
Cartman
"SORRY"?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE "SORRY"?!
Liane
Oh, my poor little baby!
Cartman
Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
Liane
Oh God! [Cries] Oh no!
Cartman
No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
Doctor
We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream. [One of the doctors brings over a plate with two sundaes on it, leaving it on Cartman's bed.]
Cartman
[Knocks the ice cream on the ground] Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
Liane
[Sobbing] Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!
Cartman
NO! NOOOOOOOO!
A shot of South Park Elementary as segue music plays. In the teachers lounge, Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Ms. Garrison, two other staff members, and all of the boys' parents are gathered.
Principal Victoria
Thank you for coming, everyone. [Stan, Kyle, Butters and Kenny walk in.]
Principal Victoria
Boys, please take a seat.
Stan
[The boys sit down.] What's going on? Are we in trouble?
Principal Victoria
Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.
Stan
[All five boys are surprised.] ...What?
Butters
Oh no.
Doctor 2
He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared.
Kyle
Cartman has HIV?
Doctor 2
We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-
Kyle
Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
Principal Victoria
All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?
Mr. Mackey
[Opens the back door] Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say "Hi", m'kay? [Eric walks into the room with a black baseball cap, a gray scarf, and an annoyed look. Everyone greets him.]
Kyle
...No. Way.
Butters
[Walks over to Cartman, putting an arm around his shoulder] How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. [Smiles and kisses Cartman on the cheek, much to his horror]
Cartman
God damn it, this sucks ass!
Kyle
...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. [Leaves the room and begins laughing in the hallway. It can be heard from in the room.]
Butters
Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
Cartman
Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
Doctor 2
No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-
Cartman
Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
A shot of the Airport Hilton, where Elton John is scheduled to hold an AIDS benefit for Eric Cartman
Inside, a group of people are in the grand ballroom. Pictures of Cartman hang on the walls. An M.C. steps up to the mic
M.C.
We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV. [there's hardly anyone there: just his mom, Butters, Jimmy, and two other adults.]
Cartman
Where the hell is everybody? [a waitress arrives with some food]
Liane
Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?
Waitress
This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.
Butters
Great benefit, Eric!
Jimmy
The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
Cartman
So this is it?
Waitress
I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now. [leaves]
Cartman
Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
M.C.
With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman.
Cartman
Just bring out Elton John already!
M.C.
Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit.
Waitress
It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!
Cartman
Jimmy Buffett?!
Jimmy Buffett
Hello everyone. I wrote this song for a very brave little boy.
AIDSburger in paradise!
AIDSburger and it ain't nice!

Cartman
Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
Jimmy Buffett
A little boy in South Park
Dyin' of AIDS in the cold dark
How he got AIDS I haven't a clue.
Wastin' away again because of AIDS and stuff
How are we all feelin' tonight?

Cartman
[sticks his middle finger up in the air] Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
Liane
Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.
Cartman
Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
The neighborhood bus stop, day. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny wait for the bus. Cartman walks up, dressed as he was a day or two ago
Cartman
Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
Stan
Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.
Cartman
Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
Stan
Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
Cartman
...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead. [Kyle bursts out laughing; Cartman angrily approaches him] Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
Kyle
[trying to stop laughing long enough to say something] I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
Cartman
No you don't!
Kyle
I do. [smiles and keeps from laughing]
Cartman
If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face! [the smirk is having trouble not breaking into a laugh] Well any God damned second, Kyle!
Kyle
I'm sorry. I gotta go home. [laughs, turns away and leaves. His laughter trails off]
Cartman
[watched Kyle leave] Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
Stan
He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
Cartman
Ironic how?
Stan
Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
Cartman
[spins around and gets in Stan's face] Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
Stan
[backs away a bit] Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
Cartman
[advances] Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
Kyle's house, night. Kyle is asleep in his room, his curtains partially open. Outside in the bushes, Butters appears dressed as a cat burglar
Butters
Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
Cartman
[comes into view also dressed as a cat burglar] All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. [they head towards the sliding door]
Butters
Okay, but... what are you going to do?
Cartman
Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
Butters
I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
Cartman
Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
Butters
I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
Cartman
I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
Butters
[reflects on the answer] Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
Cartman
[gets down to business] All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
Butters
Wow, you really know what you're doing.
Cartman
Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times. [moments later, Cartman is shown moving up along the outer wall to Kyle's window. He stops and opens the window gingerly, silently steps onto Kyle's bed, and walks over to Kyle's face. Then he whispers] You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well... [reaches into his back pack, pulls out a syringe, rolls up the sleeves on his left arm and...] let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. [...draws some blood into it and drops the blood into Kyle's mouth. Kyle instinctively tastes it and swallows it. Cartman quickly goes back out the window and slams it shut as Kyle wakes up.]
Kyle
Wagh.
South Park clinic. Kyle sits on the bed as Sheila hands him some tissue. He sneezes.
Sheila
There there, bubbe, you'll be okay. [a doctor walks into the room] Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?
Dr. Doctor
No, it isn't strep...
Sheila
Oh, well there's a relief.
Dr. Doctor
...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?
Sheila
No, why?
Dr. Doctor
[walks around to Kyle's end of the bed] Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?
Kyle
What? No?!
Sheila
Doctor, what are you saying?
Dr. Doctor
[walks up to Sheila] We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
Kyle
What?
Sheila
HIV?
Dr. Doctor
It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.
Sheila
No, that's impossible!
Dr. Doctor
[addresses Kyle] Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?
Kyle
No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe... [his eyes open wide at the realization] Oh my God. That son of a bitch! [hops off the bed and rushes out the door]
Sheila
Kyle? Kyle!
Recess at South Park Elementary. The boys are outside tossing a football. Craig catches a football and looks for an opening
Cartman
Pass me the ball! [Kyle runs in from a distance...] Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole! [...and shoves Cartman forward at full speed. Cartman falls on his face, then looks back at Kyle.] Kyle, what the F?!
Kyle
I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
Cartman
Kyle, what?!
Stan
[steps into view] What did he do?
Kyle
Why do I have HIV?!
Clyde
...Oh...
Cartman
Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
Kyle
What did you do?!
Cartman
Nothing!
Kyle
Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! [Behind Cartman, Butters motions Kyle not to say anything further]
Cartman
Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. [too late. Butters stops motioning]
Kyle
Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
Cartman
Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
Kyle
[lunges at Cartman] AAAAAAA! [start punching him mercilessly]
Cartman
Kyle!
Kyle
[doesn't let up] Here you go! [punch] Here you go! [punch. Mr. Mackey walks into the fray]
Mr.Mackey
Hey! Hey, that's enough! Break it up, m'kay?! [tries to separate the boys...] Break it up! Hm'kay?! [...but ends up hoisting them away together at each other's throats] M'kay!
Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Mr. Mackey has taken Kyle and Cartman there and now stands next to the principal
Principal Victoria
All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?
Kyle
[pointing to Cartman] He gave me AIDS!
Principal Victoria
What?
Kyle
He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
Principal Victoria
Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?
Cartman
Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
Principal Victoria
[pointedly] Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!
Cartman
[grudgingly] Kind of.
Mr. Mackey
Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!
Principal Victoria
That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
Cartman
[grudgingly] I'm sorry.
Kyle
An apology?!
Principal Victoria
You're sorry for what, Eric?
Cartman
I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
Principal Victoria
That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
Kyle
[can't believe these adults] ...What?!
Mr. Mackey
Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?
Kyle
A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
Cartman
See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. [they are shown the door]
The hallway. Kyle walks forward and leaves the principal's office. The camera tracks him, and Cartman begins to move as well.
Cartman
[keeping pace with Kyle] Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now? [stops] Kyle, where are you going?
Kyle
[turns around and returns to Cartman, then says between gritted teeth] I'm going to break everything that you own! [spins around and walks away]
Cartman
What's that supposed to mean? Kyle? [settles on the obvious] Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
Cartman's house, front. Kyle approaches the front door and opens it. He goes right in and up the stairs. Cartman appears by the driveway a few seconds later
Cartman
Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole! [Kyle enters Cartman's room and begins breaking anything he sees. First, a toy rocket. Then, he grabs a poster of Braveheart from the wall and rips it apart. Next, he grabs the Wellington Bear Magic Mic and smashes it on the floor. Cartman walks in.] What the fuck are you doing?! [picks up some of his broken toys. Kyle knocks over a box of small toys] Kyle, stop it! [Kyle breaks apart a toy Mountie after three tries] God damn it, don't! [Kyle walks over to Cartman's big toy box, grabs Clyde Frog,..] Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone! [...and rips its head right off and moves off.] NO!! [Cartman picks up the two halves of his plush frog as Kyle moves to the XBOX] AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle! [Kyle picks it up and tries to pull it out of the power socket] Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND! [stops Kyle before Kyle gets to smash the XBOX on the floor] I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
Kyle
There is no cure, you asshole!
Cartman
No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
Kyle
What hope?!
Cartman
Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
Kyle
You're lying!
Cartman
NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
Kyle
Magic Johnson?
Cartman
He was a basketball player.
Kyle
So what?!
Cartman
So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy. [grabs Kyle's shoulder] You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
Kyle
[looks at the XBOX for a few moments, then] You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
Cartman
[stunned] My God...
Denver International Airport. A list of gates are shown. Kyle and Cartman walk in and go to a Delta Airlines clerk
Cartman
We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
Clerk
Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.
Cartman
Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
Clerk
...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.
Cartman
Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
Kyle
Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
Clerk
Oh, you boys are [sticks his left index finger into a tube he makes with his right hand and moves it in and out of the tube] like that, huh?
Kyle
NO!
Clerk
Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
Cartman
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Clerk
Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?
Cartman
Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! [turns around and leaves Kyle standing there]
The interior of an airplane. Cartman and Kyle sit in aisle seats near the front of the cabin. A flight attendant walks up to them
Flight Attendant
We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?
Cartman
Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
Flight Attendant
I'm so sorry
Cartman
Yeah, well, at least [leans into the aisle and looks back at the other passengers] it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
Flight Attendant
Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer.
Cartman
No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here! [the flight attendant turns and walks away] We're on our way, buddy. [puts his left hand on Kyle's right hand] Magic Johnson, here we come.
Kyle
[coldly] Don't. Touch me.
Cartman
[removes his hand from Kyle's and places his hands together over his stomach] I know. I'm scared too.
Magic Johnson's mansion, day. Behind it is a smoggy horizon.
Magic Johnson's mansion, living room. Magic has his feet propped up on a glass coffee table. He's spinning a basketball on his right index finger as he changes channels with his left hand. An NBA Championship trophy sits on a small table to the left
Butler
Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. [Magic sheds a big tear and sniffs]
Kyle
[moments later] Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
Magic
You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?
Cartman
We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
Kyle
[quickly irritated] WILL YOU STOP IT WITH THAT?!? WHAT PART OF THIS IS FUNNY TO YOU?!
Cartman
Kyle, we need to try to find a-
Kyle
WHAT PART OF BEING INFECTED WITH A DEADLY DISEASE DO YOU FIND FUNNY?!
Cartman
[thinks for a few seconds] I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
Kyle
THEN STOP SAYING YOU'RE NOT JUST SURE, YOU'RE HIV POSITIVE!! [Cartman keeps quiet] THIS ISN'T FUNNY, AIDS ISN'T FUNNY, DYING ISN'T FUNNY, SO SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Cartman
[clears his throat] Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
Kyle
KNOCK IT OFF RIGHT NOW! THIS ISN'T FUNNY! AT ALL!
Cartman
[waits a second] Are you sure?
Kyle
[quickly] YES!!
Cartman
[waits a second] Are you HIV-positive? [Kyle smacks him] Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
Magic
Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't. [shrugs]
Kyle
Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
Magic
Well, not at all.
The hallway. Magic and the boys pass various rooms
Magic
The pool is over there [motions to his left], where I try to swim and stay in shape. My kitchen [motions to his right] is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all.
Kyle
But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
Magic
Sure.
The bedroom. The double doors swing open and the group enters
Magic
Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom. [before them is the four-post bed with curtains, and stacks of dollar bills everywhere else]
Kyle
Dude.
Magic
Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money.
Kyle
You sleep with money. Every night?
Magic
Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..?
AIDS Research Center, day. Inside a laboratory there, a scientist analyzes a blood sample through a microscope
Scientist 1
[changes focus] It's incredible. Mitch, these boys could be onto something. Take a look. [Mitch steps in and looks into the microscope] That's a sample of HIV-infected blood. You can clearly see the HIV attacking the white blood cells, right? [the HIV is indeed attacking] All right. Watch what happens when we introduce some cash. [waves a brick of bills around near the microscope]
Mitch
My God. The HIV particles are receding! [the particles scream as they sense the money, and leave the white blood cells alone]
Scientist 1
The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.
Scientist 2
Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it.
Kyle
Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
Mitch
Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.
Magic
I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!
Scientist 2
Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!
Magic
These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen. [genuflects next to them] Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.
Scientist 2
[sighs heavily and puts his hands on a lab table] Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure.
Kyle
[looks away] Wugh.
Scientist 2
I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.
Cartman
Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
moments later, a tank holding a lot of Magic's dollar bills is brought in. A shredder is lowered into the tank and turned on. It shreds the bills to into pulp and then is lifted out. The tank is lifted up over a cylinder and the pulp is poured from the tank to the cylinder, which turns out to be a giant pump. The pump is activated and pushes the pulp into a helical tube. At the end of the tube is a small chamber which distills the pulp into a clear green liquid and acts as a dropper. The liquid drips into a large syringe. Once it fills up, Mitch takes it...
Mitch
Let's hope to Christ this works. [...walks over to Kyle, kneels next to him, and injects him with the liquid. Moments later, a sample of Kyle's blood is taken and analyzed]
Scientist 1
Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look! [he trades places with Scientist 2, who looks into the microscope] The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood! [the newly repaired blood cells look like discs cut out of dollar bills. Scientist 1 turns around and faces the boys.] Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.
Cartman
All right!
Scientist 1
[throws open the lab doors and walks out] They found the cure for AIDS! [runs down the hall] The cure for AIDS!
Scientist 3
What is it?
Scientist 1
[grabs Scientist 3 by the shoulders] Large doses of concentrated cash! [runs down the hall] Get the media on the phone!
Scientist 4
[female] All right!
SNN News
Anchorman
Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS. [smiles] About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.
Nigeria, Africa, around sunset. A station wagon pulls up and a blond driver jumps out
Driver
Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!
A Cure For AIDS benefit at the Airport Hilton's Grand Ballroom
M.C.
I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman. [the room applauds. Most everyone present is from South Park] Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds [Kyle's face gets angry], these two brave friends-
Kyle
Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
M.C.
These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys [Cartman grins. Kyle is still angry], here is... Jimmy Buffett!
Cartman
[grin vanishing] What?! Aw, no!
Jimmy Buffett
Cureburger in paradise!
Cureburger. There I said it twice!

Cartman
What?! Aw, God damn it! [puts his arm around Kyle] Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
Kyle
I'm still breaking your Xbox. [turns right and walks off]
Cartman
What? No. No. [runs after him] Kyle, no!
End of Tonsil Trouble

Britney's New Look
A TV screen showing animated graphics: Decision 2008 Debate, on Fox 31
Announcer
Live, from Chicago, Illinois, it's Decision 2008.
Moderator
[in a droning voice] Good evening and welcome to the political debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama. [turns to them] First question: How do you see yourself as different from your opponent?
Stan's house. Randy has the four boys seated on the couch as they all watch TV together. Randy has a beer in his left hand. Butters is passed out while the other three boys are half asleep.
Stan
Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
Randy
This is important, Stanley! [the boys look at him] You boys should care about this stuff.
Cartman
Yeah, but we totally don't.
Randy
Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
Moderator
And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us your stance on military spending?
Barack Obama
Well, my opinion is that-
Emergency New Bulletin
Announcer
We interrupt this debate for an emergency news bulletin! It's... Britney Watch! [a montage of Britney pictures is stamped with a stamp saying "Britney Watch" inside it. Dramatic background music starts up] Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
Butters
[wakes up and looks at the screen] Man...
Randy
[getting excited, leans forward] Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?
Anchorman
Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more.
Robert Pooner
Ron, I'm standing in South Mark, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all. [the boys react to the news]
Cartman
Aw dude, that's our town!
Robert Pooner
Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground [shots of her pitching a tent and relaxing in a chair after the tent is up], and you won't believe what she did, Ron. The troubled diva took a piss. Right on a ladybug. We've blurred out parts of the photo so that it doesn't offend. [a shot of her squatting and pissing on the ladybug. The blurred area is her face]
Randy
She's such a train wreck!
Robert Pooner
When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused. [extreme closeup of the piss hitting the ladybug]
Ron
[the anchorman] This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight.
Robert Pooner
That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits! [a closeup of her chin shows two zits]
Butters
Aw, poor girl.
Randy
[rising from his armchair] Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. [heads towards the kitchen]
Ron
The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado [a photo of Brian Willis holding lots of bricks of money appears], who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars.
Kyle
A hundred thousand dollars?
Cartman
That's enough to buy slaves!
Ron
Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates.
Hillary Clinton
...and spearchuckers.
Kyle
[gets off the sofa] Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
Stan
[gets off the sofa] And she's at a hotel in our town. [Cartman gets up as well and gets restless]
Kyle
It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
Cartman
[runs off] Sweet!
Butters
[finally gets up] Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
Stan
[thinks a bit, then] Butters, don't be such a pussy.
Butters
[looks at Stan, then at Kyle] Hokay. [smiles]
The sidewalk. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk along, Cartman has his camera with him
Kyle
A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
Butters
[hidden, comes to the front] Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! [something stops them in their tracks]
Stan
Oh no.
Before them is the Komfort Inn, with a crowd of paparazzi standing in front of it. The boys walk up to the crowd
Kyle
Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
Photographer 1
Join the club.
Photographer 2
Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!
Cartman
We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! [the boys make it through the crowd and approach a set of stairs. A security guard stops them]
Guard
Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs.
Kyle
[stammers] We uh, we have special permission?
Stan
Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
Guard
You are?
Butters
[not amused] Not me! I'm a squirrel!
A hotel room. Britney is painting her toenails on a low table while on the phone with someone
Britney
But now everybody thinks I hate ladybugs. I didn't even know it was there. I can't take it anymore. I'm just sooo- [several knocks are heard at her door]
Guard
Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel.
Britney
My boys? Really? Send them in. [to the caller] It's okay. My kids are here. I feel better now. [hangs up. Stan and the others enter the room]
Kyle
We did it guys!
Stan
I told you that would work!
The Boys
Yehehahah, all right!
Kyle
Ahall right!
Britney
[walks up to them] You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?
Kyle
All right. Butters, go get next to her.
Butters
I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
Stan
Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
Britney
[walks back to the table] You're never gonna leave me alone, are you?
Butters
It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! [Britney opens a drawer and pulls something out]
Kyle
All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
Stan
Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
Cartman
[aims his camera] All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
Britney
I've got a better idea.
Stan
You do?
Britney
Yeah. [whips out a big shotgun, shoves the nozzle into her mouth, and pulls the trigger]
Stan, Kyle
NO! [the gun goes off and she falls to the ground. The gun falls away from her. All four boys stand there, stunned and speechless. Cartman does not take any pictures. After a bit, Cartman turns and runs out. Butters looks at Stan and Kyle, then heads for the door]
Butters
[stops and looks back] You killed her! [leaves]
Guard
Hey, everything all right u-. Oh.
A hospital. Not Hell's Pass. Stan and Kyle sit on chairs outside a room, waiting for word on Britney's condition.
Nurse
[over the PA system] Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please? [another nurse wheels an elderly patient across the hall]
Stan
We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
Kyle
How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
Doctor
[walks up to Stan and Kyle and faces them] She's... alive.
Kyle
Whew.
Stan
Oh, thank God.
Doctor
But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?
Kyle
Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
Doctor
I don't want you making her upset.
Stan
We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
Doctor
[sighs] All right.
Britney's recovery room
Doctor
[enters with Stan and Kyle] Ms. Spears, these boys wanted to say something. [Britney gargles something. Only her lower jaw and the base of her skull remain of her head]
Kyle
Oh my God!
Stan
Oh no!
Doctor
[by Britney's side] The boys are just shocked at how good you look, Britney. [glares at Stan and Kyle] Right, boys?!
Kyle
Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. [Britney gargles something back. The boys join the doctor at her side]
Doctor
Well, I'll let you boys have your say. [walks off. Britney gargles something]
Stan
[his voice shaking] Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
Kyle
Oh, God, what have we done?!
Britney Watch returns, complete with montage and music
Announcer
It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
Reporter
[outside Denver Medical Center, with photographers swarming the area] You won't believe what Britney's done now. The troubled pop star has just been spotted with a crazy "no top part of my head" look. This video [shown as he speaks] was taken just hours ago as Britney was wheeled into the hospital for some reason. And if we zoom in on the footage, right, ri-right here [the camera zooms in on the left breast], you can also definitely see a boob job scar. No doubt now that she's had plastic surgery in the past.
Anchorman
O ho ho, oh houch, that's gotta be embarrassing. Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went for this radical "no top of the head" look?
Chris
No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.
Denver Medical Center, Britney's recovery room. The window begins to crowd with photographers and flash bulbs begin to go off. Stan and Kyle look back at the window. The photographers begin to clamor for Britney's attention
Kyle
[he and Stan are blinded by the flash] Dude! [the doctor reaches the curtains and closes them, but the flashes don't stop going off]
Doctor
Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now!
Manager
Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager. [sees her in bed] Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.
Britney
Guglo.
Manager
Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.
Paparazzo
Brit! Over here, Brit. One for Star Weekly. [Britney instinctively raises her left arm to shield her eyes from the camera, though she has no eyes now]
Doctor
Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now.
Britney
Right. We need to take her home. Boys, can you give me a hand with her?
Stan
Yeah, of course. [begins to help out]
A side entrance. The manager opens the door and looks around for any photographers
Manager
[softly] Okay, come on! [leads the boys and Britney out] My car is right here. [opens the door and gets in. The photographers are within earshot...]
Photographer 3
Hey look!
Photographer 4
There she is! [A photographer points and his face becomes distorted. The photographers rush the car before the manager can leave]
Kyle
Oh crap! [the photographers again clamor for Britney's attention, and one of them asks about her choice of shoes]
Stan
Jesus Christ!
Manager
Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time. [to the photographers] Thank you! Yes, thanks. [drives out of the crowd and peels away. The paparazzi look on and then pursue the car on foot]
Stan
Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
Manager
That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.
Kyle
What?!
Britney's recording studio. Stan and Kyle are there with the manager and the studio crew, and they're outraged at the way Britney is being treated.
Manager
All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.
Kyle
Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
Sound Engineer
All right, Brit, let's try it from the top. [a studio hand gives her some headphones to work with, and she holds them up against what would be her right ear. She gargles intermittently]
Female Aide
God, what a train wreck.
Male Aide
She must be stoned again. [Britney continues to gargle more often and longer]
Stan
Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
Manager
Whattaya mean? She sounds great. [suddenly stops the music] Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be "love elation". Sounds more like you're saying "love creation".
Britney
Gogehah.
Manager
E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.
Britney
Egeul-gageol
Sound Engineer
Gah, she's so stupid.
Stan
What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
Sound Engineer
I know. She's really dumb, huh? [smiles]
Stan
No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
Sound Engineer
[cups his hands like he's grabbing Britney] Yeah. And she's all fat, too.
Britney
Okel?
MTV Video Music Awards 2007
Announcer
Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards
VJ
What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears! [two stage hands walk Britney out on stage]
Kyle
Aw come on now, people! [the manager is pleased with the performance]
Woman
Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby. [the song begins: "It's Britney, bitch!" Britney is waiting for her cue as dancers swirl around her. She begins to warble, and it echoes. She walks and immediately a dancer keeps her from falling.]
Singers
The way she fee-els. [Britney leans over, and another dancer stands her up again. She warbles some more] Love inside.
Man
Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.
Stan
[annoyed] She doesn't have any lips!
Singers
Temporary. [Britney warbles some more. Two male dancers come by and turn her around so the camera can focus on her ass] So hot! [a few moments she gets a solo segment and four male dancers fawn over her]
Post-Awards report
Reporter
Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues.
A green room. Britney, her manager, and the boys are watching the news report
Manager
Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow. [walks over to the door and opens it. The paparazzi is there, piled on from floor to ceiling] Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. [leaves, closing the door. No paparazzi get in. Once the place is silent, she sits back on her armchair and relaxes with a sigh. Stan and Kyle can only look on]
Stan
We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
Kyle
Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
Stan
[strokes his chin and takes a few steps forward] I know where.
TransTrak station: "Travel by Train." It's 2:24 in the afternoon when Stan pops up at the window
Stan
We want three tickets to the North Pole. [the clerk stops what he's doing and looks around]
Clerk
The North Pole? [leaves his chair and walks to the window] Who the hell goes to the North Pole?
Stan
We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. [Kyle and Britney stand behind him. Britney is wearing a wig, sunglasses, and hat as a disguise]
Britney Watch returns...
Announcer
[breathless] It's Britney Wowtch!
Ron
A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise! [a shot of Stan and Kyle leading Britney down the street]
Robert Pooner
Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe. [the camera zooms in on her crotch to show what looks like a camel's toe under her shorts]
Ron
Oooooh, ouch!
Anchorwoman
Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense.
Leslie
Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy. Britney just seems oblivious. She was bound to get noticed: you walk around with that kind of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads.
Ron
[grunts a little] Eh, David, any idea as to how big the camel toe actually was? [a shot of Britney and a camel toe together]
Robert Pooner
She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet.
Ron
Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news.
Tracy
[a picture of Butters being dragged towards an animal control truck] The giant squirrel which was picked up last week by animal control apparently now thinks it's a person. Colorado officials have taken the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins for psychiatric evaluation.
Ron
Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.
The platform at TransTrak.
Kyle
Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
Paparazzo
[behind the boys] There she is! It's Britney! [more photographers show up and begin to take pictures]
Stan
Oh no. [he and Kyle quickly whisk Britney away, the photographers hot on their tails. They pass a room whose door is slightly open. Seconds later they return to it, go in, and shut the door]
Stan
Dude, they're never gonna let us through.
Kyle
Yes they are! I have an idea.
Paparazzo 2
Britney? Where'd she go?
Paparazzo 3
There she is! [Kyle appears wearing Britney's disguise. He turns to look at the paparazzi, then runs away. The paparazzi start taking pictures and following him. He runs down the street, the paparazzi pursue him]
Inside the train. Stan leads Britney to a couple of seats by a window. Britney is wearing Kyle's hat
Stan
It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. [Britney gargles something]
The streets. Kyle continues to lead the paparazzi away from Britney and tries to lose them at the same time
Manager
There she is. Hey Britney, it's me. [Kyle ignores him and keeps running. He joins the paparazzi in chasing "Britney" down. Kyle runs through a park; they're right behnd him. Kyle runs into a garden full of statues, stops, and turns around] Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?
Reporter
Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!
Kyle
[takes off the sunglasses] I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!
Paparazzo 5
Ooo, psych!
Manager
She must be back at the train station; come on! [they turn around and go back]
Kyle
Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute! [the group turns around. Kyle drops the sunglasses] Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
Paparazzo 6
[steps forward] Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... has to die.
Kyle
[quizzically] Huh? [thunder starts rolling in the distance]
Paparazzo 7
What do you think all this effort has been for?
Manager
[a sinister smile crosses his face] It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.
Officer
She must... die.
Background Singers
Hetus. Alte omnebus. [the photographers begins to join in] Virtu e poquebus. [other adults join in this nonsensical Latin chant]
The TransTrak train heads north through the Rockies
Narrator
Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole.
Stan
You doing okay, Ms. Spears? [she gargles. From the train's cab, the conductor looks back at Britney and Stan through the cab door's window]
Conductor
[on the phone] It's her. Um no, I'm sure it's Britney Spears; [looks at a photo] it looks just like the picture. [the photo he holds is that of a camel's toe, not of Britney] You want me to, to what? Yes, I understand. [begins chanting] Rectus. Hoc honebus
A small town. A car stops and its passengers empty out: Britney's manager, two cameramen, and Kyle. The manager walks up to an elderly man and shakes hands with him
Elderly Man
Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town.
Kyle
What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
Bob Summers
Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?
Kyle
NO!
Paparazzo 8
Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice.
Bob Summers
In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die.
Paparazzo 9
We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladidator times.
Paparazzo 10
Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs.
Canadian Paparazzo
It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery and then stoned them to death.
Woman
Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
Kyle
You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
Man
Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest.
Paparazzo 11
All right, everyone's about here.
Kyle
[bewildered] Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
The TransTrak train. Everyone is sleeping when the train comes to a sudden stop and the whistle blows. They wake up.
Male passenger
Hey, where are we? This isn't right. [Stan looks out the window quickly. Outside is an empty field, but a horde of photographers race through it and reach the train, clamoring for her attention and ready to take pictures]
Stan
Oh no!
Britney
Ohhh thoooo!
Stan
[hops down and grabs Britney's hand] Come on, Britney! [pulls her out the opposite side and into the field] Come on, come on! [as they run, Kyle's hat falls away. They reach the end of the field and enter a clearing. They look around and find themselves surrounded. All sorts of people are there, not just paparazzi. The escape route they just used is closed off by more spectators. Stan looks around and some faces are recognizable, like Irene. Sheila and Gerald show up]
Kyle
Mom, Dad! [runs up to them] They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
Gerald
It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
Kyle
Be a good boy? You know all about this?
Stan
Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
Kyle
She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
Stan
Sacrificed? For what?
Randy
For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
Canadian Paparazzo
Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch.
Kyle
Corn harvest!
Randy
We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
Stan
All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
Manager
The kid is right. This has gone on too long.
Paparazzo 12
Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago.
Farmer
And harvest is coming soon.
Bob Summers
All right, folks, let's finish this quickly. [everyone whips out a camera and starts taking pictures, closing in on Britney all the while]
Stan
No wait. [Britney groans. People get close, take pictures, then make way for more people]
Woman 2
Come on, hurry up.
Woman 3
[obese] I can't run. You go ahead, I'll catch up with ya. [the barrage of picture-taking continues. The McCormicks come up to take pictures. Britney drops to the ground, sort of pleading to be left alone]
Mother
Here Davey. [hands a camera to her son. The barrage continues, with Randy, Liane, other familiar faces... Britney wilts under the lights and finally lies down completely]
Bob Summers
[throws out his arms] Hold on. [a doctor walks up and checks for vital signs]
Doctor
She's dead.
Randy
Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. [everyone turns and goes off in different directions under a windy and thunderous sky. Stan is left alone staring at Britney's corpse. Kyle is a little further away, but he too looks at the corpse]
Harvest time, dawn. The corn fields are shown, their stalks tall and full of corn. Three men are harvesting corn by hand nearby, and a motorized harvester takes care of corn in the distance
The town, late morning. A farmer's market is up. Two men are shown close-up in a booth stocked with yellow and white corn
Gil
Mornin' Bill.
Bill
Mornin' Gil.
Gil
[inspecting some yellow corn] Nice-lookin' corn.
South Park Market, day. Randy and Sharon check out the corn. Sheila passes.
Sheila
Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh? [begins to check out the corn as well. Sharon puts some corn into her shopping cart]
Randy
An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
ET Reporter
[on TV screens throughout the store] She's the daughter of a country singer, and the young girl has really taken the country by storm. Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus, though only fifteen years old, is already on her way to being a major superstar.
Jimbo
[near the beginning of the report] Hey, check it out! [the report ends and ominous music begins]
Randy
[glued to the screen] Looks like next harvest will be even better. [begins to chant. The other shoppers join in, then Sheila, and finally, Stan and Kyle. The image of the ET reporter and Miley stays onscreen]
End of Britney's New Look

Major Boobage
South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison's classroom. Mr. Mackey is speaking to the class
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it "The Choking Game", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?
Kyle
You can get high from choking yourself? [Kenny feels for his neck through his hood, then squeezes once he finds it]
Mr. Mackey
Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?
Butters
Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
Cartman
Cat pee? [Kenny lets up and then tries to choke himself again]
Stan
That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
Mr. Mackey
Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay? [Kenny is trying really hard to choke himself] Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.
Cartman's house, day. The original four boys are there, gathered around the coffee table on which stands a frame holding a cat in a harness. Cartman is almost done with the cat
Cartman
All right, this should keep my cat in place while he sprays the urine. [Mr. Kitty meows] Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? [Mr. Kitty meows]
Kyle
You guys are wasting your time.
Stan
Yeah, this is not gonna work.
Cartman
Okay, ready Kenny?
Kenny
(All set.)
Cartman
All right, bring out...! The other male cat. [Kyle walks to a pet carrier, opens the door, pulls out a brown striped cat, and places it on the coffee table opposite Mr. Kitty. The two cats meow at each other first, then growl at each other. After a short while, Mr. Kitty shoots concentrated piss into Kenny's face]
Kenny
(Woah.)
Kyle
Whoa! [Kenny staggers backwards. The other guys gather round him]
Stan
Do you feel anything?
Cartman
Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? [Kenny's not responding. His mind is elsewhere...]
Kenny's eyes are unfocused as his mind goes into an altered state. He seems to be going through space, then an acid trip, then both. Kenny descends into a Thunderbird fitted with rocket boosters and takes the wheel. He heads towards a desert planet and lands with a thud. He quickly shifts gears and peels away. He drives through the desert landscape until a curvaceous woman steps into his path. He stops. She wears a stylized cowboy hat and skimpy clothes. Kenny motions over and lets her take the wheel. Kenny can't help but look at her breasts. They head towards a huge building with breast-shaped touches all overs. The woman steps out and walks towards the stairs, then enters the building. Kenny quickly follows suit. As they walk through the building a creature stabs another one through the skull, killing him
Kenny
(Hey cool! Check it out!)
Father
I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.
Kenny
(Yeahhh!)
Father
Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.
Kenny
(Okay!) [follows her towards the fountain. At the fountain's edge, she undresses, then he begins to undress] (Woop! Woo-hoo!)
Cartman
[through Kenny's hallucination] Kenny! Kenny, wake up! [In the middle of town, Cartman is stopping Kenny from disrobing any further] Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
Kenny
(What?) [opens his eyes and looks around] (Where'd she go?) [stands up and pulls up his pants.]
Cartman
Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
Kenny
(You fucking asshole!)
Cartman
Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
Kenny
[Punching Cartman] (What the fuck did you do that for?)
Cartman
Ah, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle come up to restrain Kenny]
Kyle
Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
Kenny
[walks away from them a bit, mad] (I'd gotten so close! You should have seen her titties.)
Stan
What titties?
Kenny
[turns around] (The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)
Kyle
Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
Stan
Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
Kenny
(I almost... touched them.)
Kyle
Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
The Broflovski house, living room. Gerald walks in, grabs the remote from the sofa, turns on the TV, and sits down to watch
Announcer
Next on FOX News! [SPECIAL REPORT: FOX NEWS] It's the newest drug craze. and it's killing your kids! ["killing your kids" appears over scenes of kids falling over]
Gerald
Killing our kids? [leans forward]
Reporter
All over America, kids are getting high... on cat urine! [two women have their cats face off, and one of them gets concentrated urine on her face. She laughs] Huffing cat urine apparently causes a euphoric state [the affected woman moved her arms up and open, then freezes as her eyes get unfocused] and is also referred to as... cheesing. [Letters cut out into cheese shapes appear: "CHEESING". Cut to the front of J. Brown Elementary School, day.] Why "cheesing"? Because it's "fon to due". [the words appear onscreen. Cut to a girl's silhouette] This sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months.
Girl
[in a deep, electronically-altered voice] We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long.
Gerald
Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
Reporter
So how can you tell if your child is cheesing? [some graphics begin to appear]
1. Your child seems distant, preoccupied.
2. Your child's face smells like cat urine.
3. When you see tigers at the zoo, your child starts grinding his or her teeth.

You might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends, such as "Hey, let's go cheese." or "Do you feel like cheesing, guys?" or "Dude, I'm cheesing my F-ing brains out right now."

Sheila
[now standing next to Gerald] Kids are doing this?
Reporter
Kids do it because it's legal. [a teen boy looks at the camera with a fierce face. A skull and crossbones appear over it] What can you do before it's too late? [a picture of a cat switches with its negative for a strobe effect a few times, then ends with the negative and an echoing meow]
Gerald
We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.
Town meeting, next day. On stage are Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria, Mayor McDaniels, Gerald (at the podium), Sheila, and Officer Barbrady
Gerald
Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as "the cheese game", or "vitamin cheese", or "Mary Jane piss in your face fun time". Cheesing is spreading fast.
Sharon
[stands up] All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?
Gerald
I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
Stephen
[stands up] Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!
Gerald
With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!
Randy
[stands up again] Let's hear it for Gerald!
Stephen
[stands up again] Hooray for Gerald! [the rest of the audience begins to cheer and argue]
The neighborhood. Black vans arrive and DEA agents jump out of them. The agents enter people's houses and confiscate any cats found there. Some agents take away a small boy's cat. Bebe loses her cat Thumper to a pet carrier. Craig Tucker's sister in her sandbox cries as an agent grabs her cat out of her hands
Tricia
No! No!
Agent 1
Oh wah wah! Get over it, druggie. [walks off with the cat] Jeez... [Two other agents leave another house with a cat]
Man
Goodbye, Scrambles. [his daughter cries into his left pant leg] We'll miss you. [nearby, the cats are tossed into the DEA vans and taken away]
Kenny's house, night. He's about to cheese when two agents break in and confiscate the two cats he has there
Agent 2
Got two here.
Kenny
(Hey! What the fuck are you doing?!)
Agent 1
Sorry, these are illegal.
Kenny
(What?! No! What are you doing?!) [the agents toss the cats into the van] (You fuckers!) [the van drives off.]
Cartman's house. Three agents comb the living room
Cartman
Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off. [the agents soon leave, and Cartman walks up to the dim attic with a small book] Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now. [drops the book in front of the cat] Here. Write a diary.
South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Butters stands around while Cartman and Stan visit their lockers. Kyle walks up to them.
Kyle
Guys, have you seen Kenny?
Stan
Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.
Kyle
Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys... [Cartman and Stan turn to listen] I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
Butters
Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
Stan
Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
Cartman
Yeah, who has cats these days? [laughs nervously]
Kyle
Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
Kenny's hallucination. He's back in the alternate world, this time riding a giant bird, but the landscape is the same - breast shapes are everywhere. Kenny sees the large-breasted woman from his first trip, but now she's strapped onto a rack and is being whipped by three burly men. These men are mutants with four breasts instead of two, and two more breasts on their shoulders. Kenny lands and hops off the bird, finds a metal spear nearby, and launches it. It strikes the middle mutant man through the neck and out the sternum, killing him. The other two run away. Kenny runs to the woman, and she smiles at him. They both ride on the giant bird, with the woman's boobs resting on Kenny's head
Kenny
(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)
Kenny's house. Kyle, Stan, and Butters stand outside his door. Kyle pounds at the door.
Kyle
Kenny? [pounds three more times]
Stan
Kenny, you home? [Kenny yells some more. Alarmed, the boys open the door and enter the house. They see that Kenny was indeed cheesing. Two cats look back at them.]
Kenny
[really high] (Wooooooohoohoo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) [one cat runs out]
Kyle
Kenny!
Kenny
[still cheering and making flying motions] (Victory! Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)
Butters
Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! [Kenny flutters some more, stops, and passes out, falling to the floor]
Stan, Kyle
Kenny!
Moments later, Kenny is at the dining room table. A lock of his hair peeks out from under his hood. Butters has prepared a cup of coffee and gives it to him. Stan and Kyle stand nearby
Butters
There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
Kenny
[groans]
Kyle
Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
Kenny
(No we don't, guys.)
Stan
Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
Kenny
(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking jerkass.)
Kyle
Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! [abruptly, Kenny vomits, stops, then vomits again. Some of it gets on Butters' face and shirt.]
Butters
Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
Stan
Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
Kenny
[exhausted] (Ugh, okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)
Butters
Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
Kyle
[grabs the other cat as it walks up to him] We've gotta keep this away from him.
Cartman's house, night, Cartman's room. He's asleep. A cat meows and awakens him. The cat meows again
Cartman
[sits up] Mr. Kitty, shhh! [Mr. Kitty meows a 3rd time] Damn it! [gets up and leaves the bed. A small door to the attic opens and Cartman pops in with a candle. Mr. Kitty is nearby] Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you. [Mr. Kitty goes to a window and meows. Cartman follows him to the window] What?! [looks out a half-moon window and sees a cat, it meows] It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet. [Mr. Kitty meows] No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself. [Mr. Kitty meows] I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty. [crosses his arms] I'm in trouble enough as it is. [Mr. Kitty paws at Cartman] All right, all right, fine. [heads to the attic door and goes downstairs, closing the door behind him]
Cartman's house, outside. Cartman appears around a corner dressed in overcoat and fedora
Cartman
[whispers and motions] All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly. [two kittens walk up next to Rufus] Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all. [they all look at him sadly, one of them meows] I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to- [the cats lower their head further while focusing on Cartman, Cartman starts to have tears in his eyes] Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. [turns and leaves]
Kyle's house, day, Kyle's room. Sheila enters with folded clothes, walks to Kyle's dresser, and starts putting his clothes away. After putting away a pair of briefs she spots a cat hidden between his shirts and his briefs
Sheila
Huh? [removes the clothes hiding the cat] Oh my God... [moments later she's downstairs standing next to Gerald.]
Gerald
Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?
Kyle
[walks up to them] Yeah?
Gerald
Kyle, have you been getting high?!
Kyle
[shrugs] No.
Gerald
Then why did your mother find this [holds up a bag of contraband - the cat] in your dresser drawer?!
Kyle
[holds his hands out in denial] All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
Sheila
[pointing] Don't lie to us, Kyle!
Gerald
How long have you been on the cheese?!
Kyle
I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
Gerald
Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
Kyle
Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
Gerald
Now, Kyle!
Kyle
God! [goes upstairs]
Sheila
Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!
Gerald
First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
Sheila
What are you gonna do?
Gerald
I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. [heads off]
The basement. The door opens and Gerald enters. He locks the door and goes down a few steps, then looks at the cat.
Gerald
[showing a weakness of some sort] No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this. [continues down the steps] I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat. [getting dramatic] But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting. [approaches a contraption similar to the one Cartman made, but this one has a movie projector and screen. He takes the cat out of the bag and straps it into the contraption] I... I'll just do it one more time. [ties the cat's tail to the roof of the contraption's frame so there's no obstruction] One. Last. Time. [unfurls the screen] Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat. [moves a large empty box aside] And then I'll never do it again. [kneels down at the table and grabs the projector's trigger] After this one... last... time... [click. The projector begins to roll and a cat appears onscreen. The cat in the harness gets excited and begins to snarl. It finally squirts and Gerald stumbles backward a bit. He walks backward and freezes, his eyes unfocused]
Gerald's hallucination. He enters the same alternate universe Kenny has been in, but he's flying a B-17 bomber called Jewish Princess. He lands on the same desert planet Kenny landed on earlier. He gets off the plane and is greeted by the large-breasted woman
Gerald
I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
Cartman's house, day. The doorbell rings. Cartman rushes to answer it.
Cartman
Who is it?!
Woman
[with a foreign accent] Please! Open the door. [he opens the door, and a middle-aged woman stands before him] They say you are hiding cats.
Cartman
[quickly looks both ways] Hiding cats? [nervously] Why, that would be illegal. [backs into the living room]
Woman
[enters] You don't understand [kneels] My little Nishka, [produces the cat] She has nowhere else to go.
Cartman
Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
Woman
But they will find her.
Cartman
I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can- [his weakness comes through as the cat gazes at him] Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
Woman
[hands him Nishka, Cartman takes Nishka and pets her] Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. [begins to sob. Cartman joins her]
Cartman's attic, or secret annex. Cartman opens the door and is about to drop Nishka in when something catches his attention
Cartman
What the hell? [Kenny has somehow found the cats and is squeezing them to get cheesed. His face and parka are covered with concentrated piss. He grabs another cat and cheeses some more] Kenny, get out of here!
Kenny
(Woooooh! Woooooh!) [Kenny dances out of the attic]
Cartman
Aw, crap- Kenny! [Cartman begins to follow him down, but stops temporarily] Bad. Kitties.
Kyle's room, day. He's moping around when the doorbell rings
Kyle
Dad! Somebody's at the front door! [the doorbell rings twice and Kyle goes to his room door] Well am I grounded or not?! [the doorbell rings three times] Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! [leaves his room and opens the front door]
Stan
Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
Cartman
He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
Kyle
[quizzically] What?
Stan
He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
Kyle
What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
Cartman
They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! [crosses his arms and looks away. Stan opens his mouth in shock, Kyle looks angrily at Cartman]
Stan
Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
Kyle
I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
The huge Steamline building the large-breasted woman led Kenny into before. This time, she leads Gerald in.
Gerald
Hey everybody. Good to see you again. [Gerald and the woman head for the fountain. They both start undressing.]
Father
Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage!
Gerald
Huh... how come?
Father
There is... another suitor. [Kenny walks into view]
Gerald
What? [sees who it is] Get out of here, kid!
Kenny
(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)
Gerald
You're too young for this stuff!
Father
This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis! [the woman hides her privates, her father's arm blocks a full view of her breasts]
The Breastriary. It's built like the Colosseum in Rome, but each level has a different design... made of concrete breasts. The interior too is made of breast-shaped pieces, including a magnificent entrance made of ten massive breasts
Father
Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy! [the camera pans down and left to reveal a golden trophy made of two female statuettes kneeling back to back and holding their arms out. The woman places her breasts on their hands so it looks like the actual trophy is her breasts.]
The Breastriary floor. Kenny and Gerald face off in a joust on giant ostriches - who also have big breasts. Their lances have protective tips made of a giant breast for each lance. The rivals hold their lances up, bring them down, and charge at each other. They knock each other off the ostriches and the crowd roars. The father, emperor of this place, sits down to enjoy the match. Kenny grabs a sword with a hilt made of a pair of breasts. Gerald grabs a breast-shaped shield and a battle ax with a normal blade on one side and a pair of breasts on the other. They are evenly matched, as neither can gain an advantage over the other.
A sand box in a city park, day. Gerald and Kenny are fighting in it, oblivious to the crowd gathering around them. They grunt and punch each other. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman show up and Kyle spots Gerald
Kyle
Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
Jimbo
They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
Gerald
She's mine, you little asshole!
Kenny
(Get the fuck off of me!)
Sheila
[arriving] Gerald?!
A news report. A Channel 4 news reporter stands by
Reporter
The key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park. Gerald Broflovski is prepared to give a public statement.
Gerald
I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
Sheila
Don't touch me.
Gerald
And to the people of South Park. [a shot of the town square and its citizens] I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine. [Kenny looks down in shame] We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.
Stan
[puzzled] What the hell is he talking about?
Kyle
[eyes closed] I have no idea.
Gerald
And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.
Randy
And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. [Sharon glares at him.]
Gerald
Problem is, the more you go into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. [Kenny looks down again]
Kenny
(Yeah. I guess so.)
Gerald
Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-
Stephen
[cupping Butters' ears so Butters can't hear anything] Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald.
Gerald
The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats! [grins wide, then begins to cheer] Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! [crowd remains silent]
South Park, day. The camera drops down and focuses on Scrambles' house. The DEA agents return and gives Scrambles back to his family
Girl 2's Father
Scrambles! So good to have you back! You ain't sore at us, are ya? [Scrambles hisses, then scratches the father all over his head. His frightened wife and daughter leave him alone] Ahh! Get him off! [the boys, standing across the street, turn around]
Stan
I'm sure glad that's over with. [the boys turn left and walk away]
Kenny
(Me too.)
Cartman
But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. [Kyle stops]
Kyle
[cross] And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
Cartman
[strokes his chin] Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
Stan
You guys! Check it out. [smiles] It's Kenny. [Kenny has crossed the street to reach a flower patch. He picks one out and inhales deeply] Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
Kyle
Yeah. [Kenny begins to grab more flowers with gusto to get more of their aroma. The other boys get worried] He's getting... really high on life. [Kenny begins to snort and grabs all the flowers he can, treating them just as he did the cats earlier.]
Cartman
Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
Kyle
[runs to Kenny] Kenny! [Stan and Cartman follow. Kenny falls in Kyle's arms, goes into spasms, and then freezes, his eyes unfocused]
Stan
What the hell kind of flowers are those?
Kyle
Kenny? Kenny?!
Kenny is back in the world of his hallucination, back in the modified Thunderbird. He's flying through space with the large-breasted woman at the wheel. Every planet and moon looks like a breast or pair of breasts.
Kenny
[dances in time with the music, then gazes up at the woman's bouncing boobs] (Woo-hoo-hoo!)
The Thunderbird goes into warp and disappears.
End of Major Boobage

Canada on Strike
The South Park Elementary school gym, day. The students have been called to show up there. Mr. Mackey comes out and stands in front of a big TV and between two bulky tower speakers
Mr. Mackey
Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day.
Cartman
Oh God, I'm bored already.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please? [exits right as the tape starts up. A Canadian flag appears onscreen]
WCB President
[appears in his office onscreen] Hello, I am Stephen Abootman, President of the World Canadian Bureau. Do you ever stop to think how important Canada is to the world? Right now, I would like all students of Canadian descent in this school to stand up. [no one moves a muscle until one lone Canadian boy, Ike, stands up.] Just look at all these fine Canadians in your school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?
Cartman
Gayness! [everyone laughs and looks at Ike, who looks chagrined.]
Stephen Abootman
That's right: spirit! What is it that makes Canada so important?
Craig
Nothing! [everyone laughs harder and looks at Ike.]
Canada, day, a crowd stands in front of a building with G on it.
Stephen Abootman
My fellow Canadians, for too long we have been pushed around, and ridiculed! Yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding! Instead, Canada Appreciation Day was mocked worldwide! [the crowd begins to clamor]
Man 1
[wearing #10] Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!
Lumberjack
It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh?
Stephen Abootman
That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike!
Woman 1
Did you say strike?
Stephen Abootman
Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together!
Man 2
Canada, on strike.
Man 3
Canada, on strike.
Canadians

[a different crowd shot for each "Canadaaa"]
Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Caaanaaadaaa!
Canada on strike! Canada says "No more!"
No more neglect! We want respect! That's what we're striking for!
All you bureaucrats and corporate cats

Border Guard
Can all just take a hike! [rolls down his window shade]
Canadians

[large crowd] It's Canaada! On Strike!
[they whip out their strike signs]
Canada on strike! From Vancouver to St. John's [both locations are shown],
We raise our middle fingers for you all to sit upon!
[a hockey team] And with our fingers up your ass,
[workers at The Canadian Maple Syrup Company] you won't be very psyched
[workers in the building drop syrup barrels from the upper floors] It's Canada! On Strike!
[Mounties march in a circle] And we will not bow a bunch! Our resolve is strong!
[A conductor leads a group of singers] We even took three hours to rehearse this striking song! [a trumpeter leans in and toots.]
[Pizza Nut] Canada on strike! No matter where you are,
[On TV at Café 180] If you are Canadian then you've got to do your part!
March out of the halls!

Café 180 Patron

[stands up and poses] That's right, suck my Canadian balls!
[runs out and poses] It's Canada! On Strike!

Canadians:

[the camera zooms out to a view from space of a nation of singing Canadians]
It's Canada! Canada! Canada! On Strike!
[a lone Canadian laughs somewhere]

The United Nations, day.
Swiss Delegate
Ahhh, when you say "Canada is on strike", what exactly do you mean?
Stephen Abootman
What do you think it means?! [pounds the table] We're striking, buddih! No more! That's it! Until we get what we want
French Delegate
Who exactly are you to authorize this strike?
Stephen Abootman
I'm Stephen Abootman! Leader of the WGA!
French Delegate
The WGA?
Stephen Abootman
[crosses his arms] Yes! The World Canadian Bureau! [the other delegates don't react.]
French Delegate
What exactly does Canada want?
Stephen Abootman
We want: more... money!
Aide 1
[with mustache] Yeah! More money!
Japanese Delegate
More money from where?
Stephen Abootman
Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other countries have lots of money; we want, we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!
Aide 1
Yeah! Give us Internet money!
British Delegate
A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to- not understand how ...global economics works. I think that-
Stephen Abootman
Don't give me that fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling! Are you gonna give Canada more money or not?! [pounds his fist on the table a few times]
British Delegate
I'm afraid we can't.
Stephen Abootman
Then you leave Canada no choice. [heads for the doors. His aides open them and he heads out] This strike shall continue! [the aides head out, closing the doors behind them.]
A snowy night in South Park, a shot of Kyle's room through his window. Kyle heads to the front end of his room to look out the window. Out on the sidewalk stands Ike with his own strike sign: "HONK if you support CANADA" Cars pass by without stopping. Kyle suffers for him. A car pulls up and Ike turns to face it
Husband
"Honk if you support Canada" He- hey honey, watch this. [honks twice]
Wife
[looks at him] Oh, we're supporting unions.
Husband
That's right; we're a very progressive couple.
Wife
Yes. [reaches over and honks the horn] Oh, that's fun!
Husband
Well we've done our good deed for the week. I think now I can make love to your anus without making God angry.
Wife
Oh really? Goodie! [they drive off. Ike watches them leave]
Stan's house, day. Stan, Butters, and Cartman are watching TV. Kyle walks in from outside
Kyle
Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
Cartman
We don't care. *urp*
Kyle
You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
Stan
Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!
Butters
Yippie!
Announcer
It's the Terrance and Phillip Show. [Terrance and Phillip in] Today's episode: I Fart Huckabees. [Terrance and Phillip are shown dressed in Viking warrior outfits]
Butters
Aww, this one again?!
Stan
God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
Terrance
Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.
Phillip
Oh? Does it run on electricity?
Terrance
[the boys say the line too] No, it uses natural gas. [they do raspberries as Terrance farts on Phillip. Terrance and Phillip laugh]
Phillip
Not as fat as your face!
Butters
Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
Cartman
God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
Kyle
There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
Stan
It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. ["Terrance and Phillip" disappears and "Family Guy" comes on]
Peter Griffin
You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang "La Cucaracha" for Paul McCartney?
Cartman
[jumps off the couch and runs to the TV] No! NOOO!
Peter Griffin
La Cucaracha- [Cartman turns off the TV and faces his friends] We are NOT... resorting to that!
Striking Canadians, day.
Canadians
We want more! We want more!
Stephen Abootman
One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! [Terrance and Phillip walk up to him]
Terrance
Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.
Stephen Abootman
Go home?! You can't leave the picket line!
Terrance
But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.
Stephen Abootman
Look, guy, we are to stay strong! If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!
Terrance
Don't call me a rat, buddih!
Stephen Abootman
I'm not your buddih, friend!
Phillip
He's not your friend, guy!
Stephen Abootman
I'm not your guy, buddih!
Terrance
He's not your buddih, friend!
Stephen Abootman
I'm not your friend, guy! [all three fall silent, and Stephen goes forward] Don't you two understand anything?! You think striking is a joke?! You think it's something to ridicule?!
Weird Hat Guy
[pops in] Yah, you think this is funnih?
Stephen Abootman
[moves to address the whole crowd] Don't you see that we have to stand together or else we have nothing?!
Aide 1
[runs up with a cell phone] Stephen! Stephen! A call came in from the United States! They want to talk to you aboot ending the strike!
Stephen Abootman
What did I tell you?! I told you we'd get to them sooner or later! [the crowd gets excited and starts chatting] Shh, shh, quiet everyone! Let me handle this. [everyone falls silent as he takes the call] Yes. This is Stephen Abootman, head of the WGA.
Kyle
Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. [he's calling from his house, with the other boys standing back aways]
Stephen Abootman
Oh you do, huh?! [muffles the phone, then tells the others] They've had enough. They want us to end the strike. [everyone cheers] Quiet, quiet, shh, shh, sh- quiet, quiet! Let me deal with this. [the Canadians fall silent and Stephen returns to the phone] All right, we're prepared to end this strike! If you are agreeing that we should have more monihhh!
Kyle
We totally think you should have more money.
Stephen Abootman
Wwe got 'em! We did it! [jumps up and down with much energy. Everyone cheers. "Great job!"] All right, how much are you gonna give us?
Kyle
Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
Stephen Abootman
Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!
Kyle
The Internet?
Stephen Abootman
You listen to me, friend! [walks away from the crowd so they don't hear him so loudly] You'd better figure out a way to get us our fair amount of money, and until you come back with a solid fair number, I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead! [hangs up, then faces the crowd] Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls.
Kyle looks at the phone dumbfounded. The other boys walk up
Stan
What'd they say?
Kyle
They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
Cartman
How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
Butters
Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
Kyle
We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
Cartman
[steps up] Wait. I've got it.
A video. Butters is on a stage with bluescreen so it looks like he's actually in a spaceship. He's in his normal clothes, and he begins to dance. To his right rises Spaceman Butters, and to his left rises Pajama Butters.
Butters

I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt [the teddy bear outfit returns]
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? [Stan gives a thumbs-up. Cartman does the same. The video is on YouToob]
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!

[from behind a big chocolate heart] It's okay
[Butters floating in space] Ih-if you have a little fight
[Nelly in her room watches the video] Don't you worry
[Butters bites into the heart] I won't bite (Not that hard)
[Spaceman Butters] If you want it
[a man watches the video] I'll give you power
Just be gentle
[Flower Butters] I'm delicate like a flower

Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please

A Nun
Oh my.
Butters

[now in three voices] I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
[wearing black jeans with "what what" on the butt] I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
[a naked Butters holds a rose] You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!

Kyle's room. The boys have been watching the video from there
Cartman
There's more people viewing it!
Stan
This is going great!
Kyle
[walks over to the window] Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! [Ike is on his back]
Canada, night. The Canadians are beat. Some walk around listlessly, others have facial hair, all have bags under their eyes
Tom
And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending.
Aide 1
How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!
Stephen Abootman
Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories.
Tom
In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called "What What (In My Asshole)".
Reporter
[in front of Butters' house] Tom, in just one week the video has become the most watched thing in all of America. [Butters appears at his bedroom window and waves at the camera] The boy in the video, referred to by most as "that little gay kid", [Butters stops and leaves the window] has already been asked to appear on Jimmy Kimmel and The Today Show.
Stephen Abootman
Aw damn it that's not news! What about us?!
Phillip
Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?
Stephen Abootman
We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient!
Phillip
Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.
Terrance
Yeah, let's give it up, guy.
Stephen Abootman
Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!
Terrance
Well I'm not your friend, buddih!
Stephen Abootman
Well I'm not your buddih, guy!
Woman 2
Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!
Tom
And finally tonight, a new development in the Canada strike. For those of you who don't remember or don't care, Canada has been striking for more money. [the Canadians cheer]
Stephen Abootman
All right! Shh! I told you, I told you, listen, listensh, listen listen listen.
Tom
In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians.
Stephen Abootman
What?
An airport. A plane from Denmark is parked on the tarmac and Danish people pour out of it. The Danish have both Canadian and normal features - Canadian bodies and jaws and normal eyes
Female Reporter
Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians?
Danish Man
Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us.
Danish Woman
Nobody knows where Denmark is.
Danish Man
Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe.
Back in Canada
Stephen Abootman
SCABS! How could you?! [runs up to the TV annd destroys it with one kick]
A lobby, somewhere. DIM, it says. Department of Internet Money. Stan and the boys walk up to the help desk. They look around before Stan steps forward
Stan
Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
Clerk
Take a number and wait with everyone else.
Cartman
Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
Clerk
[not taking time out from her work] Take a number and wait with everyone else! [Stan takes a numbered slip from the dispenser and leads the other boys to some seats in a waiting room nearby]
Black Man
[slowly, a little creepily] Chocolate Raaain.
Butters
Aaah. [another man walks up to the boys]
Tron Guy
Hey, I know you. You're the "What What (In My Asshole)" kid.
Butters
[insulted, crosses his arms] "What What (In The Butt)," sir.
Stan
It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
Tron Guy
Yeah, sure. All the biggest Internet stars are here. You remember, of course, Numa Numa. [to his right is the Numa Numa guy. He begins dancing to a song]
Numa Numa
Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyaho, Ma-iyaha ha.

Tron Guy
And the Star Wars kid. [the kid starts to dance around as in his video] And the Internet sensation Cute Sneezing Panda. [as in its video, the mother panda sneezes as soon as her child moves] And there's Dramatic Look Gopher. [the camera pans by a lonely girl and focuses on the gopher, who seems to notice the camera is on him. He quickly turns to face the camera and freezes]
Cartman
Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
Chocolate Rain Guy
[to Butters] So, how many people have seen your Internet video?
Butters
Uhhh a few hundred thousand?
Chocolate Rain Guy
Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire.
Cartman
Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
Chris Crocker
[jumps in out of nowhere] Leave Chocolate Rain Guy alone! Leave him alohohone! I'm serious! [a phone rings and Kyle digs into his pocket]
Kyle
[finds the phone...] Excuse me. [...leaves his seat and exits the waiting room. Then he takes the call] Hello?
Stephen Abootman
[sitting on a cardboard box] You greedy corporate fat cat. You said you would get us moneh.
Kyle
Wait we're working on it.
Stephen Abootman
[stands and moves forward] You're stalling! Because you think I'll give up. You know that most Canadians are talkin' about giving up the strike already. [coughs away from the phone] You've got me over a barrel and you know it!
Kyle
Sir, we're doing everything we can.
Stephen Abootman
You want me to say it again?! You've got me over a barrel! There, you happy?! You've got me bent over a barrel with my tender ass just waiting to be pulverized by your thrusting manhood! [Kyle stays quiet] Do you realize how stupid I'm going to look if I call off the strike after starting all this?! I won't do it! You hear me, guy?! You're wrong! No matter what happens I will never call of this strike! Even if it means we all. Die.
Kyle
We don't want you to die.
Stephen Abootman
Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands. [slowly hangs up]
Back at the waiting room... Kyle returns
Kyle
We have to speed this up! [to Chocolate Rain Guy] Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
Chocolate Rain Guy
I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain.
Star Wars Kid
Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?!
Chocolate Rain Guy
I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches.
Tron Guy
Oh please, Laughing Baby had four times as many views as you! [the baby begins to laugh and laugh...]
Chocolate Rain Guy
You'd better shut your fuckin' mouth, Laughin' Baby!
Afro Ninja
Did you all forget about Afro Ninja? My Internet thing was bigger than anybody's. I made over a hundred million theoretical dollars.
Star Wars Kid
Well Sneezing Panda is theoretically worth billions!
Chocolate Rain Guy
You all wanna motherfuckin' die?! [whips out a Glock and cocks it]
Chris Crocker
NOOO! [grabs the gun and tries to wrestle it from Chocolate Rain Guy]
A battle royal begins. Tron Guy whips out a frisbee and chucks it at Numa Numa. It hits Numa Numa's left cheek
Numa Numa Guy
Haw!
Afro Ninja fights the Star Wars Kid, Numa Numa fights Tron Guy, Chris Crocker fights Chocolate Train Guy. Afro Ninja knocks Star Wars Guy away with his nunchucks, then tries a back flip and falls on his face. He gets up groggily and stumbles away. The baby laughs some more
Kyle
Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.
Tron Guy
Hai Hayaaa!
Numa Numa
Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyah-

[kicks Tron Guy in the balls, then lands a left hook on his face]

Chris Crocker
[jumps in to separate the two men] Leave Tron Guy alone! Leave him alone! [the baby continues laughing. Chocolate Rain Guy grabs Chris Crocker by the hair and drags him around. Chris is screaming]
Chocolate Rain Guy
Get ready for some chocolate pain, bitch! [aims his right at Chris' head. Chris quickly bites Chocolate Rain Guy's right leg, making him drop the gun. The mother panda mauls Numa Numa, Tron Guy throws his frisbee again, and Chris Crocker jumps in again]
Chris Crocker
Leave the panda alone! Leave her alone, I'm serious! [the mother panda stands on her hind legs and just swats Chris out of view, killing him. Chocolate Rain Guy reaches for his fallen gun, turns around, and kills Star Wars Kid with two shots. The mother panda mauls Tron Guy to death, and Chocolate Rain Guy kills the panda with four shots. He then aims at the gopher]
Chocolate Rain Guy
Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?! [the gopher, who's facing away from him, suddenly turns its head to him, looking at him intently] Ughhh, my brains. [his head swells up and explodes. His body staggers for a few seconds, then falls to the side. One last bullet leaves his gun and blows the gopher's head off. Anyone who was involved in the battle is gone]
Cartman
Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
Kyle's house, day. Ike is still on the front lawn, still on his back. He blinks
Canada, day. Everyone there is now tired out. Some have died, as they have X's where their eyes should be. The camera moves forward to the G (for Government) building, then flies up the side until it reaches Mr. Abootman's office. Mr. Abootman looks out the window at the crowd beneath him
Aide 1
[opens the office door] Stephen!, Stephen! They're here! They've come to negotiate!
Stephen Abootman
[turns around] What?! You mean it?! [Kyle and friends walk in]
Kyle
Okay, we did it.
Stephen Abootman
Who the hell are you?
Stan
We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
Kyle
Here. [hands Mr. Abootman the money] We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. [Mr. Abootman takes the check and looks at it]
Stephen Abootman
Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?! [turns away] You little timewasters!
Stan
Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
Kyle
Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
Cartman
...You are a homo, Butters.
Kyle
Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
Stephen Abootman
Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it! [the phone rings and he turns to answer it] Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau.
The UN, day. A conference call - the leaders talk to Mr. Abootman over a speakerphone
Swiss Delegate
Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike.
Stephen Abootman
You... You do? You wanna negotiate?!
French Delegate
No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park. [Mr. Abootman drops the phone and begins to weep. He walks away with his hands over his eyes]
Kyle
[picks up the phone] Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
Swiss Delegate
Excuse me?
Kyle
[Mr. Abootman leans on the door, crying] He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
French Delegate
Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize
Kyle
If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
Stephen Abootman
Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?
Kyle
Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
Swiss Delegate
Sure, why not?
Canada, moments later. Mr. Abootman steps outside to the podium and makes an announcement
Stephen Abootman
We have won! [no one reacts: they're all too tired to]
Lumberjack
Well how much did we get?
Stephen Abootman
Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these... [holds up some coupons] coupons to Bennigan's! And... [holds up a bag of sweets] free bubblegum... for every Canadian. [his aide steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands] These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course.
Aide 1
We did it! [aide 2 steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands]
Stephen Abootman
My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history. [headlines follow: The Canuck Reporter has "Canada Wins The Strike". Canadiety has "Strike over! Canada Victorious!". Canada Today has "Strike Victory Party Set For Next Week".]
South Park, Kyle's house, front lawn, day. Ike is still half-buried in the snow. A taxi pulls up to the curb and lets the boys out
Kyle
Ike. Ike! [Ike wakes up] It's over.
Ike
[stands up] It's over?
Kyle
Yeah. Here you go. [hands him a Bennigan's coupon and a gumdrop. Kyle and the others head indoors]
Stan
Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Butters
Me too!
Kyle
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
Stan
...Yeah.
Canada, the Victory Party. Kool & The Gang's "Celebration". Everyone is just standing around. The camera pans from left to right. Mr. Abootman and his aides appear. They're all dancing
Stephen Abootman
Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo! [the reason for everyone standing around is shown: a memorial wall on one side of the room has pictures of everyone who died during the strike. Mourners walk up with bouquets and drop them off at the table in front of the wall.]
Terrance
Hold on a minute! Wait just a second! [the music stops as Terrance holds out a calculator] We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!
Phillip
And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
Stephen Abootman
Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance.
Phillip
You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
Stephen Abootman
Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect. [Terrance and Phillip don't believe what they're hearing]
The shore of a lake. A man picks away at a block of ice. Two other men come and push it away. On it are Stephen Abootman and his aides
Stephen Abootman
Eh?! What do you think you're doing?!
Terrance
We're setting you adrift, idiot!
Phillip
Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
Stephen Abootman
You'll regret this day, friend!
Phillip
I'm not your friend, buddih!
Stephen Abootman
I'm not your buddih, guy!
Terrance
He's not your guy, friend!
Stephen Abootman
[loud and drawn out] I'm not your friend, buddih!
Terrance & Phillip
We're not your buddih, guy!
Stephen Abootman
[now far away] I'm not your guy, friend!
End of Canada on Strike

Eek, A Penis!
Mrs. Garrison's classroom. She's seated behind the desk, crying and pulling out tissue after tissue, baring her soul to the class.
Mrs. Garrison
It's like, my whole life has just been one big screw-up, you know? [wipes away tears, then throws the tissue away] I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I still feel like a man
Butters
Are we gonna get tested on this?
Mrs. Garrison
This sex change was a big mistake, okay? [blows her nose] I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted.
Stan
[to Kyle] Dude, wanna do some math problems?
Mrs. Garrison
[tosses another tissue away, grabs another one] And then, I go to the doctor, right? And I say "Doctor, I wanna go back to being a man," and he says "There's been too much damage. You can't go back. Where are you going to find a penis?" [gets up, and his chair topples over] Whattaya mean, where am I gonna find a penis?! [throws a bust] I'm a man! I deserve a God damned penis! [throws some tissues, some books, and an apple towards the class. Stan closes his eyes shut so nothing gets in them. Mrs. Garrison grabs her chair and crashes it through a window. Then he punches the wall, knocks the metal drawers over, and kicks the desk, grunting all the while]
Principal Victoria
[not seen] Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison! [he stops and looks up. He sees Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria, her arms crossed, at the door] Could we speak with you please?
Mrs. Garrison
[walks out of the classroom still sniffling] What do you want? I'm trying to teach.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay? [Principal Victoria walks into the classroom and closes the door]
Mrs. Garrison
Ohhh it's so easy for you, Mackey! You have a penis! [walks away in a huff]
Principal Victoria
Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
Cartman
[raises his hand] Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
Principal Victoria
Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? [no one else volunteers. Cartman stands on his chair and raises his left arm high]
Cartman
Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
Principal Victoria
Any other volunteers, perhaps?
Cartman
[now on his desk and stretching that left arm up higher] Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
Principal Victoria
All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.
Cartman
Yes! [walks up next to Garrison's desk]
Principal Victoria
Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly. [leaves the classroom and closes the door.]
Cartman
[turns to the board and walks up to it. He grabs the wooden pointer and smacks it softly against his left palm] Well well well. Who's teacher now? [whips it against the floor] Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!
Kyle
You're not the teacher, fatass.
Cartman
That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended! [whips the pointer against the floor] Yeahhh. [whips the pointer against the floor again] Mmm yeah, you like that? [Kyle just rolls his eyes] All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here! [whips the pointer against the floor again] Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. [waves the pointer around a little and follows it with his eyes.]
Mrs. Garrison's house, day. She's laying on her sofa with her tissues, crying.
News Anchor
And so it appears that the local farmer's market could be soon facing complete closure. In other news tonight, a South Park bio company is coming under fire for genetically engineering body parts onto laboratory mice. This picture of a mouse [a picture of a mouse with a human ear growing on its back] genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest.
Mrs. Garrison
[now attentive] What?
News Anchor
But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses.
Mrs. Garrison
Holy Freaking Jesus.
Research Group Laboratories, day. "Tomorrow's Fortune is Today".
Research Group Laboratories, inside. Researchers move around. One of them is talking to Mrs. Garrison
Researcher 1
Using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding, we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop. Here's the mouse you saw on television. [Mrs. Garrison looks at the mouse] Once the ear fully forms, it can be transplanted onto a person.
Mrs. Garrison
Doctor, what about a penis?
Researcher 1
Well, a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina.
Mrs. Garrison
No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me?
Researcher 1
You don't understand: doing this stuff is very expensive. And we've never tried a penis before; there's no guarantee it would work.
Mrs. Garrison
I will give you all the money I have to just try. Please. Doctor, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body. I need a penis.
Researcher 1
All right. [Mrs. Garrison grins] All right, let's see what we can do.
South Park Elementary, day, Principal Victoria's office. Mr. Mackey is there, as well as two school officials
Principal Victoria
Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
Cartman
Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
Mr. Mackey
Uh, "commend" means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?
Principal Victoria
[looks through some papers] After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.
Cartman
[at ease] Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
Principal Victoria
These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.
Board Rep 1
[a black man] Young man, word of your success as a student teacher has started the whole board thinking. We would like you to try your methods on one of our inner-city school classes.
Board Rep 2
[a white man] These kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?
Cartman
That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
The neighborhood bus stop. The bus pulls up and opens its doors. The boys walk out and turn right
Cartman
Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
Kyle
You're not an awesome teacher!
Cartman
Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
Kyle
The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
Cartman
Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
Kyle
Kenny's!
Kenny
(Yeah, that was my idea.)
Cartman
Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
Kyle
Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! [walks away. Stan and Kenny follow. Cartman is scared, then he starts thinking]
Cartman
Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
Cartman's bathroom. He's standing on a stool checking himself out on the vanity's mirror. He whips out a partable hair trimmer and raises it to his hairline. He shaves his head down the middle...
Jon Davis High School, day. Urban music plays as the establishing scenes go by. There are security scanners at the front door which all students pass through, and two security guards to go through their belongings if the students set off the scanners. The kids at this school are doing anything but studying: fighting, making out, smoking, throwing paper wads at each other...
A classroom. The students there are quite rowdy
Principal
[enters] Students, quiet! Quiet please! [a wad of paper goes her way and hits] Give me your attention!
Teen Boy 1
I'll give you my attention. All night long, Mrs. Miller. [the class laughs]
Mrs. Miller
[the principal] You're on thin ice, Rodriguez! Now listen up! The Denver County School Board has sent over a special guest teacher.
Class
Ohhhhhhhhhhh.
Mrs. Miller
This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez
Cartman
[dressed as Jaime Escalante] Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez. [holds up his left thumb] Your new teacher.
Teen Boy 2
What the hell is thiiis?
Cartman
I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
Research Group Laboratories, day. "Tomorrow's Fortune is Today".
Research Group Laboratories, inside. Researchers move around. One of them is talking to Mrs. Garrison
Researcher 1
Iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison.
Mrs. Garrison
Mr. Garrison! [they approach an incubator]
Researcher 1
Sorry, Mister Garrison. Your DNA has replicated and grafted very successfully with the mouse. And so... here's your penis. [Mr. Garrison gazes into the incubator. A mouse is wrapped in gauze all over, and a penis is riding on its back]
Mrs. Garrison
Wow! My penis looks great!
Researcher 1
Yes. It's a fantastic penis. Congratulations.
Mrs. Garrison
How long before it's ready?
Researcher 1
Welll, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon.
Mrs. Garrison
Let me see if it feels right in my hand. [opens the incubator door and reaches in...]
Researcher 1
No! Don't open the- [the mouse escapes]
Mrs. Garrison
Whoa no!
Researcher 2
Don't let it get out of the lab! [the mouse reaches the entrance and escapes when an unsuspecting researcher opens the door from outside]
Mrs. Garrison
Mah penis! [gives chase, and some researchers join him] Stop, penis! Come back here!
The classroom at Jim Davis High. Cartman hands out syllabi
Cartman
Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
Teen Boy 3
Hey man, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Teen Boy 4
Yeahhhh.
Cartman
Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
Teen Boy 5
Getting into college? Maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! Fuck you! [the rest of the class voice their protests as well. Cartman turns his back to them and looks down]
Cartman
How do I reach these keeds? [faces the class, his left hand tucked under the left pant pocket] The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time. [holds up a picture] This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
Teen Girl 1
Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!
Cartman
No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
Teen Boy 6
This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.
Cartman
Go ahead, the door's right there. [turns left] Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu. [the boy walks to the door and leaves. Cartman turns away from the class and sighs, dropping the photo] How do I reach these keeds?
The community park. The boys are playing in the sand box, making a sand castle. They've brought their toy trucks along. Both Butters and Kenny are present. Mr. Garrison sees them and runs towards them.
Mrs. Garrison
Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis? [the boys can't figure out what he's talking about.]
Kyle
What?
Mrs. Garrison
My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese. [runs off]
Butters
[rubbing his temples] Ow. That hurt my brains. [the pain gets worse] Oww.
Jim Davis High, another smoggy day. The boy who walked out of class is playing basketball alone in the school yard. He shoots and misses, and goes for the ball, but it rolls towards Cartman, who picks it up.
Cartman
Nice form, compadre. [walks towards the basket with the ball]
Teen Boy 6
Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.
Cartman
Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game? [whistles] Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? [a scoreboard is shown, and a boy on the platform looks over at him]
Teen Boy 7
Sure thing, Mr. C.
Cartman
[gets into position] Okay, you start on defense, amigo. [dribbles the ball for a few seconds, then whacks the boy on the right shin with a collapsible pointer]
Teen Boy 6
[falls down and grabs his right leg] AAAAH! [Cartman continues towards the basket and scores. The score is now 1-0 Visitors]
Cartman
Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
Teen Boy 6
You cheated!
Cartman
What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn. [the boy is on offense. He dribbles for a few seconds and moves to the basket, but Cartman again takes out his pointer and whacks the boy's left shin. The boy falls again, and Cartman steals the ball and scores again. The boy at the scoreboard updates the score: 2-0 Visitors] That's two to nothing, amigoo. [his opponent stands up]
Teen Boy 6
Fuck you, man, you can't do that!
Cartman
Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. [throws the ball back at the boy]
Teen Boy 6
I know what you're trying to say, but I still don't agree with it. [throws the ball away and limps off]
Cartman
Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing! [sighs] How do I reach these keeds?
Butters' house, day. Linda is washing dishes when she hears something squeak.
Linda
What is that? [turns around and looks. The modified mouse runs across the kitchen floor; she screams and hops onto a footstool, then lifts up her skirt] Eeeek! Eeeek! [the mouse runs across the floor again, in the opposite direction] Eeeek! Eeeek! [hops off and runs to the living room entrance] Stephen! Stephen come quick!
Stephen
[reading the paper with a pipe in his hand] What is it, dear?
Linda
A penis is loose in our kitchen!
Stephen
A penis?
Linda
Yes! It just ran across the floor!
Stephen
Now darling, calm down.
Linda
Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
Stephen
Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises. [Butters smiles. Stephen gets up from his armchair and walks to the kitchen. Butters joins him. The mouse runs across the floor again]
Linda
There! There, you see it?
Stephen
Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.
Linda
I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. [the mouse runs across the floor again]
Butters
Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!
Stephen
Your teacher's penis?
Butters
Yeah, that must be his.
Stephen
Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?
Butters
[didn't quite get it until...] Huh?
Jim Davis High School, day
Cartman
Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time. [hops onto a box so he could write on the chalkboard. He draws a video camera aimed at a box marked D] When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- [the errant student returns]
Teen Boy 6
I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try.
Cartman
Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack. [the student takes his seat] All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: "I mis-interpreted the rules." It's what you must also say when caught cheating! "I mis-interpreted the rules." Say it with me.
Class
"I mis-interpreted the rules."
Cartman
Good. Again.
Class
"I mis-interpreted the rules."
Cartman
Again!
Class
"I mis-interpreted the rules."
Cartman
Now you sound like white people!
Class
[now with pounding fists] "I mis-interpreted the rules!"
South Park Supermarket. Stephen and Butters have finished shopping and are packing the groceries into their car. Mr. Garrison is talking to them
Mrs. Garrison
What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?!
Stephen
Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.
Mrs. Garrison
Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere!
A Woman
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! [the three guys look up]
Mrs. Garrison
Holy Crap! [takes off after the sound.]
The Komfort Inn. The screaming woman stands on a box while her husband looks at her annoyed
Woman
Eeeek! Eeeeeek!
Husband
Carole, get down from there!
Woman
Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!
Husband
I'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it.
Mrs. Garrison
[pops into view] You saw a penis?!
Woman 2
[inside the Inn] Eeeeeeeek! [Mrs. Garrison rushes in]
The Komfort Inn Fitness Room. Mrs. Garrison finds the woman standing on a chair with her legs crossed
Woman 2
Oh, it's so big and disguuusting. Eeek. [the mouse runs across the floor and Mrs. Garrison gives chase. The penis-mouse runs down the hall and into a steam room]
Mrs. Garrison
[runs down the hall] Come back here, penis! [enters the steam room and looks around] There you are! Got you! [backs out of the steam room holding a penis... which is attached to a man. Garrison looks at the penis more closely, then at the man's face] Hey, you're not my penis. [the man punches her across the face] Ogh! [the penis-mouse runs out. Garrison lets go and gives chase again] There it goes! Stop you!
Cartmanez' class. He's giving the class the answers for the upcoming test
Cartman
The answer to #27 is 5.
Class
[repeating] The answer to #27 is 5.
Cartman
The answer to #28 is 14.
Class
"The answer to #28 is 14."
Teen Girl 2
Man, what's the point? [grabs her books and heads for the door] What's the point of any of this? [cries and exits]
Cartman
All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back. [leaves the classroom and looks around for the girl] Melita! Melita, hold on. [walks up to her] You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
Melita
There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it.
Cartman
[sighs] How do I reach these keeds? [turns around and faces her] All right, let's go get you an abortion.
Melita
No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong.
Cartman
Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
Melita
That cheating is good?
Cartman
Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself. [Melita turns right and walks off a bit] Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
Melita
I don't know, Mr. C.
Cartman
Mexicans are told not to cheat. "Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child." So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns. [walks around to face her] It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
Park County Police Station, day. Mr. Garrison files a police report
Sgt. Yates
[taking notes] And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago? [a police sketch artist works on a portrait]
Mrs. Garrison
That's right.
Officer Harris
Long whiskers or short?
Mrs. Garrison
Short, and little fluffy ears.
Officer Harris
Fluffy ears, okay.
Mrs. Garrison
Think you got it, Mitch?
Mitch Harris
I think so, sir. Is this pretty close? [shows his sketch to Garrison: it's Mickey Mouse with a giant boner under his shorts]
Mrs. Garrison
[disappointed] No, no, not like that! That's just silly. [an officer walks into view]
Officer
Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.
Sgt. Yates
What is it?
Officer
Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.
Mrs. Garrison
Wall come on! [runs out. The two other officers follow him]
Buca de Faggoncini Italian Restaurant, night. Diners are eating their meals, and a small penis-mouse appears on the floor
Woman 2
[quickly jumps onto her chair and lifts up her skirt] EEK!
Man 2
[looks around] What's the matter?
Woman 2
A penis!
Woman 3
[quickly jumps onto her table and lifts up her skirt] A penis? Where?
Woman 4
There it is! [quickly jumps onto the table at her booth and lifts up her skirt] Eek! [the other women at the restaurant do the same thing, and soon all you hear are "Eek, a penis!"]
Mrs. Garrison
[enters the restaurant followed by the three officers] Where is it?!
Mitch Harris
Look, there! [points to the mouse as it heads to the kitchen. A waiter doesn't notice the mouse passing by him]
Mrs. Garrison
Come on! [he and the officers run to the kitchen]
Chef
What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen? [wields a rolling pin]
Mrs. Garrison
[entering with the cops] Huy! Don't you dare kill my penis! [the mouse leaves through an open window] Crap! We've gotta go back around!
Outside. The penis-mouse climbs along items behind the restaurant and runs along the top of a wooden fence. The camera follows it past the moon in the distance. The mouse stops and looks at the moon
Mouse
Someone somewhere is loving me tonight
Looking at the same moon and seeing it so bright.
Penis
Someone somewhere is feelin' my despair
Mouse
Feelin' my despair
Penis
And this same moon is
Penis, Mouse
[together] making them think of that-.
Mrs. Garrison
There it is! [the mouse runs away. Garrison gives chase again, with the cops and the chef joining him. The mouse runs to the sewer and drops in] No! Nooo! [dives after it, but can't reach far enough in to get it] No! No!
Mitch Harris
There's not a chance now.
Mrs. Garrison
No we, we can find it! [looks intensely down through the grate]
Sgt. Yates
Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men. [they leave. Garrison stands up, beat]
Cartmanez's classroom. Mrs. Miller and Cartman stand before the class.
Mrs. Miller
Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit. [a quick cheer goes up] The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating.
Cartman
Uh what?
Mrs. Miller
The test will be tomorrow. Make us proud. [turns right and leaves the classroom]
Teen Boy 8
Monitor us in a private room?
Teen Boy 3
Now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along.
Teen Boy 2
I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!
Cartman
Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
Teen Boy 8
[stands up] Shut up, man! You reyally screwed us all!
Cartman
How do I reeeach these keeeeds?! [the boy, cowed, slips back into his seat. Cartman faces the board] Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, "Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat." You know what happened? [dryly] They lost. [faces the class] Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
Teen Girl 1
Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.
Cartman
You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
A bus stop across the street from Buca de Faggoncini, night. Mrs. Garrison is on her back on the bench, crying
Mrs. Garrison
You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis. [a squeaky thing is heard. Garrison notices and stops crying] Well what the? [raises her head and looks down, then looks towards her feet. The mouse that has been fleeing all night is now struggling to get on the bench] Why... it's my penis. [the mouse is now wholly on the bench] My penis came back. But why? [the mouse moves closer. Mrs. Garrison lowers her left hand to the bench. The mouse walks onto her hand, and she lifts it up] I guess it's true. What's that old saying? "If you love your penis, let it go..."
Jim Davis High School Auditorium. Mrs. Miller addresses the audience while Mr. Cartmanez' class stands behind and to the left of her
Mrs. Miller
The standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country. Twenty-four of our students took the test and all twenty-four scored 100% [their parents applaud. Melita and a short boy look at each other]
Teen Boy 6
Uh, can we say something?
Mrs. Miller
Sure. [leaves the podium. The short boy reaches for a plaque and hands it to the taller boy, who now takes the mic]
Teen Boy 6
We would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the White People Method. Mr. Cartmanez! [Cartman, standing far from the podium and off to one side, walks up to the podium and reaches the mic. The students gather 'round him and clap as adults take pictures.]
Cartman
[basking in the success] I reeached these keeeds.
South Park Elementary, main entrance. Everyone is gathered there for a special occasion
Principal Victoria
Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. [everyone claps as Mr. Garrison makes his return]
Mr. Garrison
Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend. [the mouse that grew his penis climbs onto his right shoulder, the penis having been removed from it and attached to Mr. Garrison. Garrison turns around] But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man.
A Teacher
Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second. My wife had ovarian cancer, so she can't have babies.
Mr. Garrison
Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot! [Thompson is dumbfounded. Garrison turns around and jumps up to click his heels] Yeah! I'm back!
End of Eek, A Penis!

Over Logging
Stan's house, night. He's at his computer browsing the Internet. His mom pops in...
Stan
Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
Sharon
Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!
Stan
[sighs] Aw man! [shuts off his monitor as Sharon leaves, then goes to bed. Sharon heads for Shelly's room]
Sharon
Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime.
Shelly
Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!
Sharon
Now, Shelly! [leaves and closes the door]
Shelly
Why do you hate me?!
Sharon
[entering Randy's study] Randy, off the Internet.
Randy
Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.
Sharon
No, mister, it's time for night-night.
Randy
But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
Sharon
You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. [leaves and closes the door]
Randy
[left to his thoughts] One more thing? [thinks a bit and then starts typing quickly] Ooooyeah... [starts masturbatng under the desk]
Stan's house, next morning. The sky brightens just before dawn.
Stan's room, 7:30 a.m. His alarm goes off and he sits up, turns the alarm off, and heads for his computer. He turns on his monitor and tries to visit a Web page. His browser tells him he's not connected to the Internet
Stan
What the hell?
Randy
[entering, still in his night robe] Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! [reaches Stan's desk with urgency and moves Stan away]
Stan
What?
Randy
My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
Stan
My Internet's not working either.
Randy
What?! [sees but doesn't believe]
Shelly
[enters Stan's room with her laptop] Dad, the Internet's not working!
Randy
[pulling on some cables] I know that, okay?!
Shelly
I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
Sharon
[enters] Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.
Randy
[leaves the computer to be in the middle of his family] Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. [he's the only one looking panicked]
The Broflovski house, moments later. The doorbell rings and Gerald answers in his pajamas. He's got a cup of coffee with him. The Marshes are there in their night clothes
Randy
[in despair] Gerald. Please help us.
Gerald
Randy. What happened?
Randy
Our house... It has no Internet.
Sheila
[arrives and stands next to him] Oh my God.
Randy
[enters the living room] We've got nothing! It's just gone.
Gerald
Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
Randy
[gratefully] Thank you Gerald. [the other Marshes enter]
Stan
[heads for a computer] I'm getting on it first.
Randy
[giving chase] Oh no you're not!
Stan
[steps into Kyle's room] Kyle, I need to use your Internet
Kyle
Ih it's not working.
Randy
[steps into Kyle's room] What?!
Kyle
I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
Gerald
No. [rushes to the computer to see for himself] No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
Randy
[firmly] It's not working, Gerald.
Gerald
But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
Randy
Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!
Kyle
I have to get online before school.
Stan
What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
Randy
Right, Starbucks!
Gerald
Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
Outside. As the two families head for Gerald's SUV, Stephen Stotch walks by. Behind him, a couple stands looking at their laptop
Stephen
Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?
Randy
No! Nobody's is!
Man 1
[comes out of his house with a laptop] Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!
Randy
Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
Gerald
Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. [everyone climbs in.]
En route. They move down the road while on either side people have no idea what to do without the Internet.
Randy
God, the whole neighborhood's affected. [a man sticks a Yoshiba laptop in front of the windshield]
Gerald
Get out of the way, Peterson! [motions him away]
Starbucks Coffee. A crowd is already gathered there hoping to get inside
Clerk
Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.
Kyle
It's not working here?
Randy
Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
Man 2
No, don't. You're wasting your time.
Randy
How do you know?!
Man 2
Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!
Gerald
How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
Stephen
Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.
Randy
Good idea! [walks forward a bit and pulls out a Blackberry] No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!
Mr. Garrison
[with pipe and laptop] There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
Gerald
We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
Man 3
What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
Randy
[thinks a moment] A television! [everyone else thinks, then moves down the street as if they were one]
Tele's, moments later. Randy walks up to the plate-glass window with a chair and smashes the chair through it. Jimbo walks into Tele's first and everyone else follows. Jimbo turns on a TV and everyone else gathers to see the news. Onscreen, the small floating window says "This page cannot be displayed." At the bottom of the screen is a crawl that reads "THERE IS NO INTERNET"
Anchorman
Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back.
Randy
Jesus, it's statewide.
Gerald
It could be nationwide.
Anchorman
Hello? Do you have Internet? It it's Channel 4 News. No, we don't have Internet either. [everyone leaves Tele's]
Gerald
No Internet... anywhere...
Randy
Jesus... we're all alone... [POV change to a shot of the town from a distance. Another POV change to a shot of the town from even further away]
South Park shopping district. The town seems empty. A window shutter opens and closes somewhere. It's Monday. Next scene is a shot of the Marsh house, eight days without Internet. Tumbleweeds begin to roll in. Inside, no one is doing much. Randy's asleep on the couch, Shelly's sadly looking outside, Stan sits on the floor, Grandpa is in his wheelchair. Randy begins to cough
Sharon
What's the matter?
Randy
I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. [coughs]
Shelly
What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead. [looks at Stan] If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! [starts punching Stan around like a punching bag. Stan screams]
Randy
[pulls Shelly away from Stan] Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!
Stan
Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
Randy
You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
Sometime later. The Marshes have packed and weighed their car down with everything they can load up on it.
Gerald
Randy, where will you go?
Randy
We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
Gerald
You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
Randy
Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
Stephen
It could come back.
Randy
Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find. [motions to Sharon] Come on, let's go.
Stephen
Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?
Randy
How. You won't have Internet. [starts the car and moves out]
En route to California. Randy takes the Mother Road, Route 66, all the way there. They enter Arizone and pass a man holding a sign saying "Californee. Need Internet." They stop at a Canyon Motel - which has no Internet
Motel Clerk
[fanning himself] Sorry folks, we're full up.
Randy
Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
Motel Clerk
You and everyone else. You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee. [motions the direction of travel] It's about a mile down the road.
Transient Camp. $50, night. The full moon shines brightly behind the trees. The camp is a tent and a farmhouse. Randy takes up the guitar and starts playing
Randy
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. [an elderly man weeps]

Transient Man 1
Where are you from, old-timer?
Old-Timer
Kansas City. Had me a store there. Kind of... computer supply store. When the Internet went, the stores went too.
Transient Man 2
Things will be different when we get out to Californee. Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.
Transient Man 3
Why sure, Silicon Valley. They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it.
Transient Man 4
When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.
Transient Man 1
Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.
Randy
Sure will be nice. [Stan looks really sad]
Transient Man 5
You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?
Randy
That's right. We need to get online.
Transient Man 5
Haha. "Get online" he says.
Stan
[annoyed] What's so funny about that?
Transient Man 5
Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there? [the other men look at each other] Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone tryin' to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like. I knows it 'cause I seen it. My two children, they tried to load a Web page. Took them over three days. They sat there waitin', and by the time the loadin' bar was only half-full they was dead. [his eyes begin to well up] Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder... [weeps]
Randy
Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. [the group breaks up for the night]
The campsite. The Marshes have set up camp. Stan heads for a sleeping bag when he notices Shelly crying.
Shelly
Amiiir... I miss you so much...
Stan
[walks up to her] Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. [she just sits up and punches him away like a beach ball, then lies down without a break in crying]
The Marshes enter Californee
Randy
Everyone, wake up! [the others wake up] We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! [takes an off-ramp]
An Internet Refugee Camp, run by the Red Cross. A big-city skyline is seen in the distance. The camp is well-guarded, and cars go in one by one. Randy drives up to the entrance, where a Red Cross worker greets him
Worker
Name?
Randy
Do they have Internet here?
Worker
Name?
Randy
Marsh.
Worker
Service provider?
Randy
NetZero.
Worker
All right, stay in line. [moves on to the next car] Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite.
Randy
So is there Internet here?
Worker 2
[voice only, from the front] Stay in line and get to your campsite. [Randy drives forward and into the camp]
The campsite interior. The camera scans the place until Randy's car comes into view. The car stops and the family steps outside. Randy walks up to two men sitting by a tent
Randy
Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.
Refugee Man 1
Yeah, they've got it here. [Randy gives a thumbs up]
Stan
All right!
Refugee Man 2
But there ain't enough to go around. All they got is a little Internet. [curls his thumb and index finger to create a small space between them] Barely a bar a signal. So they have to ration it out, carefully.
Refugee Man 3
Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.
Randy
Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
Volunteer 1
Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do.
Refugee Man 4
Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon.
Volunteer 2
All right, time's up.
Refugee Man 4
No! No wait! I haven't entered the shipping information! [an MP hauls him away] NO! NOO!
Volunteer 2
Next? Brady, John H.
Randy
Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? [Sharon is within earshot]
Sharon
[walks up to him] What did you say?
Randy
Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
The Broflovski house, day. Another tumbleweed rolls by. The Broflovskis are watching TV. Two anchors are on screen with a fax machine between them
Anchorman
And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here. [the fax machine starts printing]
Anchorman 2
A fax! A fax is coming through! [points to it with both index fingers with lots of enthusiasm]
Anchorman
Oh yeah, a fax!!
Anchorman 2
Oh a fax!
Anchorman
It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!
Anchorman 2
It's a fax, we got a fax! [the fax copy pops out and both men grab for it. ] Uh-
Anchorman
Oh! it says, "The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it."
Anchorman 2
[a few seconds later] We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!
Kyle
Where... is... the Internet?
A bright morning in the Southwest desert. Military helicopters appear and descend on a secret landing
General
Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.
Scientist 1
We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly.
General
Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!
Down below is a huge cave with research equipment all over the place.
Scientist 2
Here it is, general. The Internet. [before them is a colossal router]
General
What's wrong with it?
Scientist 2
See that flashing orange light in the middle? It's supposed to be solid green.
General
[walks towards it a bit, in awe] My God.
The refugee camp, later. Another man is looking at the Internet.
Transient Man 6
Hahaha, thedancingkitty.com, heh, wum, I wonder what that is, hum? [the site appears in the browser] "Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize!" hoh, ahaha, ha.
Volunteer 2
All right, time's up.
Refugee Man 5
No, wait, I I just clicked on the kitty. I got it. [the MP comes up and hauls him off too] No! It wasn't long enough! NOO!
Volunteer 2
Next? Nelson, Peter T.
Randy
[approaches a volunteer] Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
Volunteer 3
Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get.
Randy
[grabs the volunteer's arm, takes him aside and says in a soft voice] I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
Volunteer 3
So jack off.
Randy
[lets go] You don't understand. [the volunteer crosses his arms] I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
Volunteer 3
What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!
Randy
Three minutes would be plenty.
Volunteer 3
Get lost! [walks away]
Randy
[feeling pain in his genitals] Ohhh.
Back at the campsite.
Sharon
[handing out tickets to her children] All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.
Shelly
What number are you, turd?
Stan
Eight fifty one.
Shelly
[switches tickets with him] You're nine twenty three now.
Stan
Hey! Mom!
Sharon
[returns] Shelly, give your brother his ticket back!
Shelly
Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! [runs away]
Randy walks slowly due to his aching balls. He doubles over from time to time
Refugee Man 5
Psst. Hey! Over here! [Randy looks over, then walks to the man] You... happen to be looking for Internet porn?
Randy
Yeah, how'd you know?
Refugee Man 5
Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy.
Randy
I know, right?
Refugee Man 5
Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say "click".
Randy
"Internet Porn Simulator" [the tent is an "Internet Porn Simulator. Whatever you want to see."]
Refugee Man 5
Give it a try. [lifts up one of the entrance flaps for Randy. Randy enters and sees a makeshift computer on a desk. The monitor is a hollow box. Randy sits down. A hand descends into the hollow box holding a sheet of paper that says "Anything you want to see with the click of a button!"]
Randy
Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click. [the hand goes up, some scribbling is heard, and the hand comes down again with a picture of one Japanese stick figure pissing on another's face while the second stick figure lies on her back. This does not arouse him. He rolls away from the desk] Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this! [no one responds] Damn it. [rolls back to the desk and unzips his pants.] Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click. [gets ready to masturbate in anticipation. The picture comes down, and it's three black stick figures with their cocks out surrounding a Japanese stick figure.] Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click. [another picture comes down, this one of a stick-figure woman with a penis. Randy is grinding away down there] Bestiality? Click, click on that. [the next picture is that of a stick-figure man fucking a stick-figure pet in the ass. Randy is close to climax] Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click! [the next picture is that of a Brazilian stick-figure woman farting on a stick-figure man.] Dahya. [the climax fails to arrive] No. No, this isn't gonna work. [pounds his fist on the desk and walks out] It's just not the same.
Refugee Man 5
Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card.
Randy
[reaches into his back pocket for his wallet] Well at least that part's like the Internet.
The Broflovski house, day. The Broflovskis are watching the news
Anchorman
We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live!
Field Reporter
Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again.
General
[through a megaphone] All right, Internet. What do you want from us? [the collosal router does not reply] If we've angered you somehow, let us know. [lowers the megaphone] Try to communicate with it digitally again. [a scientist plays a few notes on a music keyboard. There's no reply. The scientist is about to play again when the original notes are sent back, with two others. That didn't go anywhere] I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! [a sniper fires at it, but the bullet had no effect. It just bounced off the router]
Kyle
Hey, wait a minute. [gets off the couch and walks away to think alone] Is it possible that...
Gerald
[stands up] What is it, Kyle?
Kyle
I think... I know what's wrong.
The refugee camp, night. A woman is looking at the Internet now
Shelly
This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
Stan
It's gotta be our turn soon.
Volunteer 2
All right, folks, it's bed time. No more Internet for today.
Refugees
AWWW!!! [various protests are heard after this]
Woman
A little closer!
Volunteer 2
No, no, we're locking it away until tomorrow. [the MPs unplug the computer and carry it and the desk away] Everyone get to bed!
Refugees
Aw man! [everyone walks off mumbling, disappointed]
Woman
Wha?![puts her left hand on her head and walks off with her head tilted back]
Shelly
Gggggyyaaah! [punches Stan away, then walks away in the other direction]
A storage room at the refugee camp. The volunteers put the computer away and Volunteer 2 locks the room shut. Randy sees an opportunity and mulls it over. Moments later he's at the room's window looking in. He tries sliding the window open and succeeds. He pulls himself into the room through the window, looks around, forgets to close the window, and walks over to the computer. He starts it up.
Randy
Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes! [softly as he types] Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. [click. He finds a page right away. The girls are only heard, not shown]
Girl 1
Haro Kiti kawaii n desho? ["Hello Kitty is cute, isn't it?" puke]
Girl 2
Un. Choukawaii yo ne! ["Yes. Super cute, right?!" puke]
Randy
Oh niice... Whoa... [begins masturbating]
Girl 1
Watashi wa... daisuki! ["I" puke "love it!"]
Randy
[types away] Now let's see some bestiality. [click. The sound of a woman being rammed by an elephant is heard. Randy is hitting his stride, then heads towards climax] Aahahaha, yes! Ogh! [types away] Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there! [click. The Brazilian fart porn fetish page loads.] Oh that's good eh! Oh! [a view from outside the shed] Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! [other refugees here this and walk out of their tents to see what's going on. Sharon and the kids are out too, but they don't say a thing.]
Refugee Man 2
What is that?
Refugee Man 4
Sounds like someone's bein' attacked by a tiger.
Randy
Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
Volunteer 4
Get the keys! We gotta get in there. [volunteer 2 runs to the door and whips out his keys. Three other volunteers, one of them a woman, follow him up. They get the door open and enter the shed]
Randy
[voice descending] Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! [the oldest volunteer turns on the lights and they all gasp in shock. Randy is spent, his semen all over the room, the desk, the computer, and himself.]
Volunteer 2
What the...? [Sharon and the kids rush in]
Stan
Dad?
Sharon
Randy!
Randy
[trying to explain it away] Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm! [volunteer 4 heads for the computer] Did you see the ghost? [the volunteer begins typing on the keyboard] It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!
Volunteer 2
You son of a bitch!
Randy
Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! [volunteer 4 looks back at Randy, who looks back at him]
The underground cave
Field Reporter
This is our last chance. With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy [Kyle is shown standing before the router] to attempt his method to get the Internet running again. [shots of this breaking news airing all over the U.S.] It all comes down to this. Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet? Or will it be gone forever?
Scientist 1
All clear for procedure.
General
All right! Let's do it! [Kyle walks forward, then up the ramp. His parents fear for him. He walks up and to the right, sees the massive plug and walks to the socket. He just pulls the plug out, waits a few seconds, and plugs it back in. The router responds with a full green signal.]
Scientist 2
Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now!
Scientist 1
He did it!
Scientist 3
I've got Internet!
Scientist 4
Me too!
Scientist 5
Internet activity in all sectors, sir. [everyone cheers. Kyle looks around a little puzzled]
The refugee camp, moments later. The men from the camp the Marshes first visited are there
Transient Man 5
I've got Internet.
Transient Man 6
Me too!
Transient Man 3
It's back! [everyone begins to cheer there too]
Breaking News. The two anchors are waiting for any news.
Anchorman
It's back? It's back! [the two anchors dance a jig]
The refugee camp, moments later. Shelly hugs her laptop
Shelly
It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! [a boy in the background turns around and looks at Shelly]
Amir
Shelly. Shelly Marsh? [both Shelly and Stan turn around to look at him]
Shelly
What?
Amir
It's me. Amir.
Shelly
O... kay.
Amir
Your family came here too, huh?
Shelly
[bashful] Yeah. [the two of them look away from each other]
Amir
So uhhh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home.
Shelly
Yeah, okay. Sounds good.
Amir
Okay, s-see ya. [turns around and walks away]
Shelly
[turns around and skips away] We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!
South Park City Hall, day. Randy is addressing the town. He's dressed in a Native American shirt over his regular clothes
Randy
And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT [pounds the podium hard with his right fist. A few people are startled by this] that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally, [the head of a bald eagle appears on the screen behind him.] We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. [everyone applauds him, then gives him a standing ovation. He has his left arm up and fist pumped.]
End of Over Logging

Super Fun Time
Entrance to Pioneer Village, day. The South Park Elementary school bus is parked. Mr. Garrison waits with a bearded employee as the class enters the attraction
!Mr. Garrison
Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. [the bearded employee steps forward, his hands gripping his suspenders]
Pioneer Paul
Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?
Stan
Ughh.
Kyle
This is gonna suck.
Pioneer Paul
When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome. [tips his hat a bit to the class] To 1864. Set 'em up!
Mr. Garrison
Thank you, Pioneer Paul. [Pioneer Paul turns around and walks away.] All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. [the students look at each other and begin to pair off.]
Cartman
Let's be partners, Kenny.
Kenny
(No, I'm partners with Craig) [holds Craig's hand]
Cartman
Okay. [turns and follows Stan] Stan, let's be partners, dude. [Stan approaches Wendy and holds out his hand. She takes it]
Stan
Naw, I'm with Wendy.
Cartman
Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad! [Wendy flashes him an angry look as he turns and walks away. He looks around and sees most everyone is paired off. He approaches Kyle] All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
Kyle
I hate you, remember? [turns away] You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
Cartman
[miffed] Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token? [Clyde and Token pair up] Who, who else needs a partner? [after the rest of the kids have paired up, only Butters is left. Cartman looks at him and he gets bashful all of a sudden, brushing his left foot back and forth on the ground] Uh who else needs a partner?
Mr. Garrison
Eric, partner with Butters.
Cartman
God damn it!
Mr. Garrison
Hold Butters' hand, Eric! [Butters motions for Cartman to take his hand]
Cartman
That isn't necessary!
Mr. Garrison
Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
Butters
I understand. [takes Cartman's hand as Garrison turns towards the village]
Mr. Garrison
Cartman
You can let go now, Butters.
Butters
[firmly] No.
Cartman
Butters, come on!
Butters
No! [the class is at the center of the village. Around it are a carriage house, the saloon, and the feed and tackle store]
Mr. Garrison
All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff. [the pairs disperse] Keep track of your partner!
The smithy's shop. The smithy is working on a horseshoe resting on an anvil. Stan, Wendy, Kyle, and Jimmy drop by
Smithy
Why howdy partners. [puts his tools down] I'm the town blacksmith. Are you folks settlers, or are you just trappers passin' through?
Stan
Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
Wendy
Thanks, Stan.
Pioneer Paul
[dropping by] These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?
Kyle
[points to the Smithy] That guy is wearing a digital watch.
Smithy
Oh jeez. [adjust the watch to hide it. Pioneer Paul gives him an angry look]
Pioneer Paul
Damn it Chad!
Chad
[puts it in his pocket] S-sorry, I'm sorry.
Another smithy shop, this time for guns. Cartman, Butters, Kenny, Craig, Jenny and Riley visit
Gunsmith
Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns.
Cartman
I wanna shoot an Indian.
Gunsmith
Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store. [Kenny, Craig, and the two girls leave. Cartman and Butters head for the holes in the wall]
Butters
Do you see any Indians?
Cartman
Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs. [just over the greenery is Super Phun Thyme, a small attraction next door.] "Super... Phun Thyme." [turns to Butters and has him step forward] Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
Butters
Oh, that's cool. [steps back and turns around] Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
Cartman
Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
Butters
Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
Cartman
Fine, then let go of my hand!
Butters
Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
Cartman
Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
Butters
I'm not lettin' go!
Cartman
Fine, then you're comin' with me!
Butters
No, Eric! [trips and stands up. Cartman pulls him towards the village's entrance]
Cartman
Butters, let go God-damn it!
Butters
Pioneer Paul leads Stan, Wendy, Kyle, and Jimmy into the general store.
Pioneer Paul
This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.
Clerk
Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
Wendy
Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.
Clerk
What do you mean "back then"? Don't forget, it's 1864.
Kyle
Right. Except for it really isn't.
Pioneer Paul
Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye. [they look around, but the modern sound of sirens reaches their ears]
Kyle
What's that?
Stan
Sounds like police sirens.
Pioneer Paul
What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864. [the sound of screeching tires is next, and everyone heads to the windows to find out. A big black SUV pulls into the village and seven people pour out of it. One of them is injured]
Leader
We lost them, we lost them!
Injured Man
Damn pig cops!
Leader
Close that gate! [two of his henchmen close the gate]
Wendy
What's going on?
Stan
I don't know. [the gunmen gather up the students and adults]
Leader
Everyone down on the ground NOW!
Sheriff
Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog. I settled here back in eighteen fif- [the leader shoots him in the forehead with a silenced gun]
Stan
Jesus Christ! [the six of them move away from the window and drop to their knees] We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
Stan
Jesus Christ! [the six of them move away from the window and drop to their knees] We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
Pioneer Paul
A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing.
Stan
What?!
Kyle
Come on, this is serious!
Pioneer Paul
Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?
Clerk
Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.
Stan
Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
Pioneer Paul
If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West.
Stan
[in no mood to hear about it] This is not the time for that!
Super Phun Thyme. Cartman pulls Butters towards it.
Cartman
Aw man, this is gonna be awesome! [the go through the double doors] Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
Butters
Well, that's your problem!
Cartman
All right Butters, I've seriously had enough! [tries to rip his hand out of Butters' grip, but only succeeds in pulling Butters around. He tries again, but Butters isn't letting go. He tries a third time, all the way around, and Butters' hand is clamped on tight.] Jesus Christ! [drops the matter and goes to a counter with Butters] One please.
Butters
Make that two! [they each give $6.]
Cashier
Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?
Butters, Cartman
NO! [she gives them their tickets and they go into the attraction]
Super Phun Thyme, interior. Cartman and Butters go into an indoor amusement park. A bounce house is off to the right and miniature golf to the left. Bumper carz and laser tagg are on either side of the bowling lanes. The arcade is on the second floor.
Cartman
Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
Butters
We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
Cartman
Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! [yanks Butters along.]
Pioneer Village Administration. The façade is 1860s, the building itself current. Wendy reaches the entrance first.
Wendy
Over here. This looks like an office.
Kyle
[opens the door and leads the others in, then spots the phone] Here! Here's the phone! [Wendy gets on the stool and tries to dial out]
Pioneer Paul
Well, what a straaange contraption.
Wendy
I can't get a dial tone. [Kyle listens, then lowers the receiver]
Kyle
What's the number to dial out?
Pioneer Paul
Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'.
Stan
Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! [Kyle and Wendy trade places]
Clerk
Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-
Pioneer Paul
[grabs him by the collar and shoves him against the door] Brresh! [points something out to him. It's a sign over the door: "Remember: Never Break Character!"]
Clerk
Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.
Pioneer Paul
I'll say.
Kyle
I got through. Hello, police?
911 Operator
Nine one one, what's your emergency?
Kyle
There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
911 Operator
Taken hostage where?
Kyle
The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
911 Operator
You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
Kyle
[glances back at the two men] Sister, you don't know the half of it.
Super Phun Thyme. Cartman rides a Space Pilot rocket
Cartman
Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
Cartman
I'm having a super fun time playin

Cartman and Butters are at a Thirst For Blood video game. Cartman navigates, Butters fires away half-heartedly
Cartman
Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here! [next they're playing air hockey. They take turns, but still have to run together in switching sides. They run to Butters' side and Butters hits the puck] Oh, you got it. Nice. [they run to Cartman's side, and Cartman hits the puck. They run back to Butters' side...]
Cartman
Super fun time, please don't go awahay.

Cartman and Butters skate as a pair on roller skates, then they share an ice cream sundae. A couple walks by and looks at them funny.
Butters
What are you whoofelin' at? [the couple hurries away]
Cartman
No more worries or cares, super fun time.

Cartman
[on a Road Hogg motorcycle ride as Butters gets on] Waiwait, keep- you're fine. [starts the ride. The motorcycle rocks back and forth quickly] Oh man, whoa!
Butters
Whoa! [gets tossed into the air, but doesn't let go of Cartman's hand. He ends up on Cartman's lap before the ride ends]
Cartman
The answer to my prayers, super fun time.
Super fun time, you're all I need.

Cartman and Butters are playing Laser Tagg, except that Cartman is shooting at Butters gleefully. Next, they finally hit the bumper cars. Once everyone is in, the power is turned on. Butters is stuck outside the car, as there's no room for him, so he gets some injuries.
Cartman
Yeheah, we're wired up!
Cartman
I'll have a super fun time till I freakin; bleed.
I love you mornin' noon and night, super fun time.

Cartman
[two cars bump into him] Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! [Butters is battered]
Cartman
You make my life so right, super fun time.

Near the entrance, still inside
Butters
Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
Cartman
Aw, just a few more things.
Butters
No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
Cartman
Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. [they leave Super Phun Thyme]
Pioneer Village, later. The leader of the gunmen barks orders into a walkie talkie and paces back and forth.
Leader
Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area. [turns to the hostage group] Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination.
Mr. Garrison
Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. [the kids are shocked at him. The sirens are heard again]
Blond
How did they find us?!
Leader
Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building. [a bunch of police cars show up at the parking lot and their officers quickly get out and get into position]
Police Chief
All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage.
Blond
How did they find us?!
Leader
Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building. [a bunch of police cars show up at the parking lot and their officers quickly get out and get into position]
Police Chief
All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage.
Lieutenant
Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!
Police Chief
Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here!
Officer 1
What did they rob, sir?
Police Chief
A Burger King.
A table in the building the leader was referring to. The leader is there with the injured man and a woman. They pool their money onto the table
Leader
All right, good. Is that all of it? [a big balding man comes in with several Burger King meals in bags]
Balding Man
No. Don't forget we've got these too.
Leader
Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan. [pulls out a cell phone and dials some numbers.] I'd like to speak with the chief of police! [listens] Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!
Outdoors in Pioneer Village. The group that was in the administration building now arrives in the center of the village and ducks down behind a trough
Kyle
Why aren't the cops coming in?
Wendy
They must be negotiating.
Pioneer Paul
Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.
Kyle
[annoyed] Will you shut up!
Stan
Wait, you have guns here?
Pioneer Paul
Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.
Stan
Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
Pioneer Paul
All righty. Come on, storehand.
Clerk
Yeppir! [they leave]
Kipling, near Pioneer Village. Cartman and Butters head back to the village after a few hours at Super Phun Thyme.
Cartman
Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
Butters
We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
Cartman
Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
Butters
Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.
Cartman
[stops in his tracks] Uh oh. [sees the police at the Pioneer Village entrance.] Crap, they called the cops on us.
Butters
What?! They called the cops?!
Cartman
They must have realized we left. Damn.
Butters
Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
Cartman
[covers Cartman's mouth and takes him behind a mail box] Shhh! Butters!
Butters
[quickly upset] We're gonna get it now!
Cartman
Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
Butters
You just got me busted forever!
Cartman
Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
Butters
No! [turns away]
Cartman
All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
Butters
You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. [punches him softly on the chest with his free hand]
Cartman
If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right? [Butters calms down and stops sobbing] All right, now let go of my hand.
Butters
No.
Cartman
Butters?
Butters
Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
Cartman
All right, come on! [they head back towards Super Phun Thyme]
Inside Pioneer Village, day. The leader gives more commands as he walks along. He reaches one of his henchman, who's got monitoring equipment laid out and operational
Leader
Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Ohrlich.
Ohrlich
The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted.
Leader
Above ground?
Ohrlich
Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It's an old mine shaft, [a picture of an abandoned gold mine appears] but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock.
Leader
So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.
Ohrlich
One more thing, Frans: I want my share of the take now.
Frans
[finally, a name for the leader] What's the matter, Ohrlich? Lose your sense of trust?
Ohrlich
I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.
Frans
Very well. [hands him a wad of bills and a Burger King lunch bag. Ohrlich opens the bag, takes out his burger, and leafs through its contents like a deck of playing cards to make sure nothing is missing]
The village square, moments later. The blacksmith is tied up and sitting on a wooden chair. The woman hits the blacksmith's right eye with the butt of her gun
Frans
I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!
Smithy
I told you, mister, what would I know about a door code? I'm just a simple blacksmith. With my trusty forge I makes all the metalworks for the village. [the woman strikes his face again with her rifle] OW.
Frans
[holds up the smithy's employee profile] You are an employee here, that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons, [reads from the profile] Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!
Smithy
Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's... Old Smithy. Hand we ain't never heard of no fire code, why, we gots to put fires out ourselves when the- [the woman strikes his face again with her rifle] OW.
Frans
That's it! [aims his gun at Smithy's left temple. The woman backs away] Tell me the code or you die! [the smithy sobs] One... two...
Smithy
I...
Frans
Yes?
Smithy
I don't know nothin' about no fancy door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith. [Frans kills him and his body drops off the chair. The class and the pioneer villagers but Craig are stunned]
Craig
[observes] These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. [another worker is tied up and put on the chair as the smithy's body is dragged away]
Worker
No. Please. Don't hurt me.
Frans
Give us the code to that door and we can leave!
Worker
[shuts his eyes hard] I've never heard of sss-something called a door code. [leans over and whispers] Please, can't you ask some other way?
Frans
I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die right now! [gets his gun ready]
Worker
All right, all right! Look, it's just, it's just one of those... Jenkins home security locks. You press the top button and then, and then enter 5-2 [he's killed, but by someone else. The class and the pioneer villagers gasp when it sees whom the killer is. Pioneer Paul is shown with a rifle in his hand, and the general store clerk is next to him]
Pioneer Paul
[tosses his rifle away and walks to the class] What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich.
Frans
God damn it you people are fucking insane!
Kyle, Wendy, Stan, and Jimmy have seen this all from behind the trough
Kyle
I don't believe it.
Frans
Domino, [looks at the balding man, then at another henchman] Walsky! Find out if there are any employees or students wandering about! Bring them here or shoot them! [the two henchmen move out]
Wendy
Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! [they start to move.]
Jimmy
Yeah. [all stop] We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast. [they finally leave]
Outside Pioneer Village. The police are scouring the surroundings. One of them answers a call
Officer 2
Sector Bravo, no activity.
Butters
Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
Cartman
Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside. [turns left and points] Look, see that traffic signal down there? [the intersection is shown] If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
Butters
That looks dangerous.
Cartman
Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on. [they head to the signal. Butters is lighter, so he goes up first. He pulls Cartman along up the traffic signal, then stands on the arm] Good, that's good. [Cartman stands up too] That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across. [they begin to tip-toe along the traffic signal's arm.] Go easy. Good.
Butters
Oh gosh in heaven.
Cartman
It's all right. You've got it, no problem- [his left foot slips, causing them both to lose their balance] OP.
Butters
Whoa!
Cartman
Save me!
Butters
I'm gonna fall! [they both scream as they struggle to stay on the arm, but they both fall off... and end up hanging from the arm like a pair of tennis shoes tied together]
Cartman
... Oh dude, laaame.
The village square. Frans is still on top of things.
Frans
Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?
Domino
We found somebody. [the two henchmen he sent off earlier return]
Walsky
We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.
Pioneer Paul
[gasps] You let out Murderin' Murphy?
Murderin' Murphy
Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail!
Frans
[frustrated and pissed off] Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!
Woman
Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
Frans
[approaching the employees] I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code!
Pioneer Paul
You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all.
Frans
I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM! [walks over to the students...]
Mr. Garrison
Not me! Not me not me not me not me! [...and grabs Kenny]
Kenny
(What? Hey, let go.)
Frans
[drags Kenny to the employees] Do you want to see a child die?!
Kenny
(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
The traffic signal, later.
Butters
I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
Cartman
Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look! [a big truck is headed their way] This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
Butters
Huh... [swings over, and they both land on the truck. They then move about looking for a good position to jump from]
Cartman
Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
Butters
Let's do it!
Cartman
Ready? Go! [they leap off the truck and over the wooden wall. The police are not aware of this. They land on a roof and roll of it into a wooden wheelbarrow, which tips over and dumps them onto the ground.]
Inside Pioneer Village. at the village square.
Frans
[Domino and Walsky bring the female employee over to Kenny, who is tied up on the chair] What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?!
Woman
I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.
Frans
God damn it!
In a nearby building, Stan, Wendy and Jimmy hide under a table. Kyle peeks out a hole in the boarded-up windows behind the table
Kyle
Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
Stan
I can't let them do it. [comes out from under the table] I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. [turns and heads for the door, then exits the building]
Kyle
Stan?
Wendy
[leans out] Where are you going, Stan?
Stan
Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. [turns around, grabs some dirt, rubs it on his face, and walks to the hostage area]
Frans
All right, that does it! [jabs the tip of the gun up against Kenny's hood. Kenny just looks at him] On the count of three this child dies! One! Two!
Kenny
(God damn it, someone help me!)
Stan
[walks up] Well howdy there, strangers. [everyone looks at him as he approaches] Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
Pioneer Paul
Ohhh, welcome, partner. [the other employees welcome him as well.]
Frans
Wha-what are you doing?
stan
I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
Pioneer Paul
That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa.
Murderin' Murphy
They killed my pahr!
Stan
I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
Pioneer Paul
Y-y-yeah, I understand that.
Clerk
Finally, a fella that talks some sense.
Stan
If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
Pioneer Paul
Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864.
Clerk
Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.
Frans
Eighteen sixty four. Ohrlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us! [smiles]
Mr. Garrison
No, you got your door code, let us go!
Walsky
Copy that. What's the code, over. [Butters and Cartman step out from behind a building, then quickly step back behind it before they can be seen]
Cartman
Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters. [they step out again and walk towards Walsky, who gets ready to shoot] Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
Butters
Yeah, it sure has.
Cartman
Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
Butters
Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
Cartman
Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
Butters
Been a hoot all right!
Walsky
Get your hands behind your head!
Cartman
What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
Walsky
Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now! [they put their free hands behind their heads, which surprises him] Let go of each other!
Butters
Huh uh.
Walsky
Do what I tell you!
Butters
Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
Walsky
Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!
Cartman
Butters.
Walsky
Now!
Butters
No! [remembering how Cartman swung him around at Super Phun Thyme, he swings Cartman around and knocks Walsky down. He and Cartman sprint across the field and manage to avoid the barrage of bullets Wilskey sends their way]
Cartman
Jesus Christ! [Walsky fires off a grenade, which hits a house just as Cartman and Butters run past it. The blast blows them off their feet]
Butters
AAAAH!
Cartman
AAAAH! [this and the gunfire alert the other robbers]
Frans
Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages! [the gunwoman and Ohrlich leave]
Stan
Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
Murderin' Murphy
Yeah.
Stan
He done killed yer pahr.
Murderin' Murphy
[stands up enraged] What?! Well I'll rip his head off! [runs towards Frans and tackles him]
Officer 2
We've got a chance. Hostages are clear! [officers climb over the wooden wall and pour into the village.]
Frans
They are coming in! [the shootout between cops and robbers begins. Ohrlich is shot dead and his burger drops to the floor next to him. The gunwoman fires, and the cops fire back. She is shot through a window and dies.]
Mr. Garrison
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Officer 3
Whoa, no, no!
Officer 2
Hostages are secure at the park entrance!
Murderin' Murphy
I got you now, Pioneer Paul!
Pioneer Paul
They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy! [they get into a fistfight. Domino shoots at the cops from the second floor of the saloon. The cops fire back and Domino keels over, dead. Frans walks over to Ohrlich's body and takes back his cut]
Police Chief
[arrives and aims his gun] Freeze, scumbag! It's all over! [Other officers gather and aim their weapons. Frans drops his satchel and puts his hands behind his head.]
Woman
Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!
Officer 2
[aims his gun at the men] Stop right now! It's over! [a bell rings out three tones and the fistfight ends]
PA System
Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock. Pioneer Village is now closed for the day. [Murphy and Paul let go of each other and stand up smiling] Head back to your wagons and have a safe trip home.
Pioneer Paul
We made it!
Murderin' Murphy
We made it! [the employees hug each other and begin to disperse]
Woman 2
Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress.
Murderin' Murphy
Whoa, that was great! [the employees begin to drop their makeup and other bits of costume]
Pioneer Paul
Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!
Gunsmith
Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeño poppers!
Murderin' Murphy
Yeah, that'd be great!
Man 1
All right!
Man 2
Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers.
Man 3
Let's go, huh.
Outside Pioneer Village, evening. The cops finish up their investigations. Mr. Garrison talks to them with his class around him.
Wendy
Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.
Stan
I know.
Police Chief
Come on you!
Frans
You're hurting my arm!
Police Chief
Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it?
Frans
In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all.
Police Chief
That's true. [Frans is put in a squad car and the cops continue with their work]
Wendy
[looks at Pioneer Village] Hey look. [Butters walks towards the entrance dragging Cartman behind him. Cartman is passed out. Butters drags him over the sidewalk, across the parking lot, and on to the bus. Only then does he let go]
Butters
Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! [all energy leaves him and he passes out too]
End of Super Fun Time

The China Probrem
The Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremonies. The flag of the People's Republic of China flaps over the Bird's Nest, aka the National Stadium
Announcer
Welcome to the televised broadcast of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies from Beijing. [fireworks enter the stadium and the drum roll begins. The drummers are bent over their drums as lights in the drums flash on and off] Thousands of Chinese performers playing ancient Chinese drums. [the roll ends in a wave of drummers standing up straight and not drumming] The precision of their movements made even more impressive by their massive numbers. [all the drummers strike their drums at once and the light display resumes]
Cartman's room, night. Cartman isn't having a peaceful dream
Cartman
[dreaming about being at the Opening Ceremonies] No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them! [The stadium lights come up and the drummers resume their drumming. Cartman is getting restless] No! No!
Liane
[knocks on his door] Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?
Cartman
[talking in his sleep] They're gonna... take over the world! HAA! [The drummers start up again] Too many of them. [Cartman now dreams of walking among the drummers] No! Leave us alone! [The drummers strike solidly on their drums, and Cartman now finds himself bouncing on the drums as they rise and fall under him] Nooo! [Four different groups of Chinese Olympians surround him. Cartman wakes from his nightmare and checks his face to be sure he's not dreaming] Damn it no! No!
Liane
[quickly enters the room, turns on the light and comes to his side] Sweetiekins, are you all right?
Cartman
Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
Liane
[consoles him] No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.
Cartman
[sobbing] They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
The bus stop, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny await the bus. Cartman walks up and stands between Kyle and Kenny.
Cartman
[being serious] All right. Guys, we need to talk. [no response from the other three] You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something. [the other boys stay silent] Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
Kyle
[steps forward, away from the others] I'm sorry. [holds his palms up and out, then shakes them as if to hold off something] I I'm sorry, I can't do this. [then lowers them] I'm not doing this. [walks off to his right]
Stan
[stops Kyle in his tracks just by saying] Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
Kyle
Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! [walks away. The other boys look at him, Stan a bit shocked]
Kenny
(Damn.)
'[Kyle's room, moments later. Kyle is at his desk moping, his arms crossed and his face buried in them. Someone knocks twice, then opens the door. It's Stan.]'
Stan
Kyle. [Kyle doesn't reply. Stan sighs, closes the door and approaches him] Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you've got to let this go.
Kyle
Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
Stan
Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
Kyle
[leaves his desk angrily and faces Stan] Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did [takes his hands, puts them side by side, and sweeps them out away from each other] nothing!
Stan
There was nothing we could do, Kyle! [Kyle walks away. Stan says softly] There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
Kyle
[turns around and faces Stan] Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
Stan
How?
Kyle
[turns away again] I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again. [clenches his fists at the thought of it, then loosens the grips and turns around] And because we did nothing... they got away.
Stan
You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
Kyle
[wipes something from his forehead] I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. [walks out of the room. Stan watches him leave, then sighs]
Stan
[puts his hands in his jacket pockets] God damn it.
Butters' bathroom. Butters is taking a bubble bath with a rubber ducky and a toy submarine
Butters
Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
Cartman
[bursts into the bathroom, startling Butters] There you are, Butters!
Butters
Uhuh, Eric.
Cartman
Butters, I need your help.
Butters
Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.
Cartman
The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
Butters
The Chinese?
Cartman
I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
Butters
Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
Cartman
You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
Butters
Why are they gonna kill my parents?
Cartman
Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny. [with determination] Will you join me?
Butters
I don't want my parents to die.
Cartman
[hops onto the stool] So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
Butters
Well sure.
Cartman
[cups Butters' right hand between his own two hands] You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
Butters
Yeah, [pounds his left fist into the water] fuck 'em.
Kyle's room, night. He's asleep
Kyle
No... No! [he's having a nightmare] No...
In the dream. Only the voices are heard at first
Kyle
No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
Stan
Let's get out of here!
Kyle
We can't just leave!
Stan
Come on!
Kyle
Aw it's horrible! [we now join the dream already in progress]
The setting is the Bijou theater, day. The movie playing is "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"
Stan
Oh God!
Kyle
Somebody do something!
Clyde
Why are they doing this?!
Inside the theater.
Kyle
They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're... [blinks hard] they're raping him! [Stan quickly covers his eyes]
Stan
I can't watch! [uncovers his eyes and rises from his seat] Let's get out of here Kyle! [leaves. Kenny follows him out of the row, then Clyde, Butters, and Jimmy.]
Kyle
Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
Stan
COME ON LET'S GO! [grabs Kyle by the right hand and drags him out]
Kyle
WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
Stan
JUST RUN!! [the six boys run out of there.]
Outside the theater.
Stan
Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie? [Kyle throws up] Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
Clyde
[in despair] Whyyy? Whyyy?? [Kenny runs around is disbelief]
Jimmy
We can't help him now.
Butters
Well I thought it was pretty good.
Stan
Let's just go, Let's just go! [grabs Kyle's right hand and pulls him away from the theater]
Kyle
[suddenly wakes up] NOO! [sits on the edge of his bed.] Noo. No. Awwh. [sobs softly in relief] Aw no...
South Park, day. Cartman and Butters walk down the street and approach a corner. Cartman is carrying a duffle bag
Cartman
All right Butters, we're here. [sets the duffle bag down] Are you ready?
Butters
I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
Cartman
This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now. [points at something across the street - a P.F. Chang's China Bistro] Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. [opens the duffle bag and begins to search through it]
Butters
But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
Cartman
Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them. [pulls out a Chinese peasant hat] Here, put these teeth in! [hands him some buck teeth] And just say "herro" and "prease" a lot. [puts in his own buck teeth and squints his eyes] "Oh, herro prease." Ping pong ching chong.
Butters
Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
P.F. Chang's, moments later. Cartman and Butters enter in Chinese costumes. Cartman now has makeup on his eyes while Butters wears a fez and has drawn glasses around his eyes
Greeter
[a woman] Uhh welcome to P.F. Chang's. I'll be right with you. [turns to other guests]
Butters
[leans over] Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.
Cartman
[panics, voice rising] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Butters
[walks up to him] What?
Cartman
It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
Greeter
Uh, can I help you?
Cartman
Ah yes, herro prease. [puts his hands together and bows a bit] We are Chinese peopull.
Butters
[also bows] Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.
Greeter
Uh yeah, why don't I seat you over here? [they follow her to their table and take their seats. She gives them their menus] Your waitress will be right with you.
Cartman
Fruttar sheshar. [the greeter leaves] What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck! [goes into hushed tones and points] There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there! [Butters leans over and looks back. Sure enough, a Chinese family of five is looking at them] Do you see them?
Butters
Yeah.
Cartman
Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
Butters
Stay calm, Eric.
Cartman
They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go- [Butters smacks him, shutting him up] Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats. [they make their way to the family's table] Oh, herro, prease, herro.
Butters
[bows a bit] Herro, prease.
Cartman
So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
Butters
Fing fong ting tong.
Cartman
Ting ton teetong.
Mother
他们在干什么啊？[subtitled] What are they doing?
Father
诶，我真的不知道。[subtitled] I don't know.
Cartman
Yeah, [gibberish] So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. [snickers. The family just stares at them]
Stark's pond, evening. Jimmy sits on a bench staring out over the water as the sun sets. The lake looks more like a lake should look now
Stan
[walks into view] Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle. [walks towards the shore] You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
Jimmy
And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen.
Stan
Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
Jimmy
I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same. [Stan turns right and sighs] Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator? [Stan turns his head to look back] It didn't make any sense, Stan.
Stan
[turns to face Jimmy] I don't need this now. [looks away and closes his eyes] I just want things to be the way they were! [runs off]
Jimmy
[turns left to follow Stan's path] You can't run away from it forever, [faces the lake again] Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow.
Stan wanders through town, but stops to remember something: he's in the movie theater watching a movie and eating popcorn
Stan
Indiana Jones! All right! [The screen is shown: Indy is at the foot of a long set of stairs]
Indy
[turns to face Stan] Hey there, Stan. All set to see my new adventure?
Stan
[happily] You bet, Indiana! [Stan's jaw drops. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas walk up behind Indy, smiling] No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
Spielberg
Well well hello there Indiana. [rubs Indy's left shoulder]
Lucas
[pats Indy's back lovingly] You're looking cute. [they begin to rough him up]
Stan
No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! [they begin to disrobe Indy]
Spielberg
Oh yeah! [Spielberg rips Indy's shirt open]
Indy
No! [Stan covers his mouth in disbelief and alarm]
Stan
Indy! [Lucas and Spielberg now have Indy pinned to the ground]
Lucas
Yeah! Get down! Get back down! [Spielberg pulls down Indy's pants as Indy wails]
Spielberg
Hold him, Lucas! Come on!
Lucas
[holding Indy down] Heheh! He-he ain't goin' nowhere!
Spielberg
[gets on top of Indy] Yeah!
Stan
No, stop! Raape!
Indy
HOOOOOOOOO! [the daydream ends and Stan has tears in his eyes. He breaks down and falls on all fours, weeping. He raises his face and fist to the sky and continues weeping]
P.F. Chang's. Cartman and Butters are still there...
Cartman
All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
Butters
Okay, okay.
Cartman
Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
Butters
Huh, invasion pran.
Cartman
What day is American invasion again? I fohget. [snickers]
Father
'Scuse me, miss?
Greeter
Yes sir?
Father
These people won't leave us alone.
Cartman
[thinks a bit] ...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
Father
You aren't Chinese.
Cartman
Oh my God...
Butters
We're busted! Uh what do we do??
Greeter
Okay, why don't we go...
Cartman
Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?! [moves into the main area of the restaurant] Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies! [a couple stops eating] The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall! [points to his right] I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. [pulls a gun from a pocket and hands it to Butters]
Butters
A gun?
Cartman
Hold the gun on them Butters!
Butters
I don't want a gun, Eric!
Cartman
They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
Butters
Oh jeez...
Cartman
Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move! [the guests rise from their seats with their hands up and move over to the wall Cartman pointed to] We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
Patron
This is stupid. I'm leaving!
Cartman
Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
Patron
[walks towards the front doors] Screw you!
Cartman
Shoot him, Butters!
Butters
No!
Cartman
You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
Butters
Waah! [looks away with his eyes shut and shoots at the patron. The bullet hits the patron in the groin, which splatters all over his clothes. The patron puts his hands over his crotch in pain]
Patron
Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!
Cartman
Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
Butters
Huh?
Cartman
That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
Butters
But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
Cartman
[faces him] It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
Stormy Weathers's office. Kyle sits in a chair facing the Stormy, who's behind his desk.
Kyle
My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I [sniffs and wipes his nose with his right hand] I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
Stormy
[looking through the paperwork] You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.
Kyle
I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day. [sniffs and wipes his nose with his right hand] But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
Stan
You aren't alone. [he enters the room with Kenny, Clyde, and Jimmy]
Kyle
[gets off the chair] Stan?
Stan
We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again. [begins to cry and leans into Kyle's shoulder. Kyle consoles him and begins to cry. The other boys cry as well] I love you.
Kyle
I love you too.
Stormy
[interrupts the crying] Uh kids, kids, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.
Stan
Wh-why?
Stormy
You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.
Kyle
[points at him] Did you see it?
Stormy
Yes I saw it, but I- [his face drops and he turns away] But I just try not to think about it.
Stan
Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
Stormy
I don't know what I saw! [crosses his arms] All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-
Kyle
Indy deserved more than that!
Stormy
[wheels around] GET OUT! JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE! [the boys leave, and the DA slams the door shut on them. The DA returns to his desk, sits in his chair, and begins to cry. He remembers the scene this way:] No, no... [pounds his desk]
a bar, night. Indy is at a pinball machine playing away
Spielberg
Well well, Indiana Jones. [the Stormy is playing on a different arcade game] You're looking nice. [the pinball machine the Stormy is at has a Willow theme all over; the one Indy is at has a Howard the Duck theme. Lucas has Indy pinned on the machine with his pants down. Spielberg unbuttons Indy's shirt and starts licking his nipples.]
Indy
Hey. Hey! [begins to wail and moan]
Spielberg
There you go, Lucas! Dick him! [Indy struggles to get away, but Lucas is in full control] He's gonna do it right there! All right! All right Georgie!
Lucas
Grab his hands, heh. [Spielberg runs up and holds Indy's hands down on the pinball machine]
Stormy
Hey leave him alone! [Lucas now pulls down his pants and sticks his dick in Indy's ass, firmly covering Indy's mouth with his right hand to muffle the screams.]
Spielberg
COME ON BIG GUY!
Indy
NOOO! [three men approach to see what's happening. Indy looks at them and they quickly leave. The pinball machine moves violently. A glass of beer resting on it falls and shatters. Lucas comes to climax and the strain on his face is clearly shown. The Stormy covers his eyes, and his recollection ends]
Stormy
Nooo... Nohoho... [pounds his desk. Moments later he opens his window as the boys leave the courthouse] Waaait! [the boys stop and look up] Wait I... want to help! [begins to cry. The boys down below begin to cry also.]
P.F. Chang's, night. The diners are all up against the wall.
Father
Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America.
Cartman
Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us! [police sirens are heard approaching] Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! [walks towards the front doors]
Captain
You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.
Cartman
[walks outside] No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu- [notices something different. The camera shows that one of the police officers is Chinese] AAH! [runs back inside and back to Butters] Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
Butters
Uhwhat?
Cartman
[quite agitated] One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters! [heads to a window with Butters in tow, and opens it] Don't come any closer! We have information that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
Officer
The President?
Captain
All right men, come on. We're going in.
Cartman
No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! [Butters shuts his eyes and shoots. The Chinese officer is struck in the groin and it explodes all over his clothes]
Chinese Officer
[puts his hands over his crotch] Ow! Ah, o-ow! [Cartman looks on in disbelief]
Cartman
Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
Butters
What? What happened? [looks outside the window]
Cartman
God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
Butters
Aw, I did it again?
Cartman
What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool! [looks away for a few moments, but...] You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
Butters
[finally speaks up] Well okay, I'm sorry!
Cartman
...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick! [walks away] God damn it!
Park County Police Station, night. Stormy and the five boys are inside
Stormy
It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you.
Det. Yates
Are you nuts?! I'm not going out and arresting Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
Stan
But they raped Indiana Jones!
Kyle
I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
Det. Yates
I didn't see it. [the boys stay silent]
Jimmy
...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
Det. Yates
No! I don't think anybody here saw it. Did you, Mitch? [Mitch is at the window looking outside through the glass] Mitch? Mitch? [close-up on Mitch, who begins to remember... Indiana is walking through some Southern woods when he encounters two men, one with a rifle, one with a knife.]
Spielberg
[holding the knife] Well well, Indiana Jones. What you doin' in our neck of the woods? [menacing] Now let's see you just drop them pants!
Indy
Drop?
Spielberg
Just take 'em right off.
Indy
Uh what do you guys want?
Lucas
Don't say anything, just do it. And pull off that little ol' biddy. The shirt there, too. [Indy takes off his clothes]
Spielberg
Them panties. Take 'em off. [Indy reluctantly removes his briefs. Spielberg turns and throws his knife into a nearby tree and goes after Indy. Indy turns and runs, but Spielberg chases him down and tackles him.] There, boy! I bet you can squeal! I bet you can squeal like a pig! [twists Indy's left ear lobe] Come on, squeal. Squeal now. Squ-squeal! [Indy tries each time, but can't do it] Weeee! Squeal.
Indy
We-eee!
Spielberg
Squeal louder. Weeee!
Indy
[at the same time] Weee!
Spielberg
Louder louder! Weeee!
Indy
[at the same time] Weee!
Spielberg
Indy
No...
Spielberg
Yes, sir! Come on, squeal! Weeeeee!
Indy
[squeezes his eyes shut] Weee!
Spielberg
Weeeeee! [Lucas grunts excitedly] Weeee!
Indy
Hawwww! Hawwww! [Murphy's recollection end and he's crying. Kyle walks up to him and consoles him]
Kyle
It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. [Murphy begins to bawl and that sends the boys to crying]
P.F. Chang's, day. The police have fallen back to their original positions
P.F. Chang's, inside. Cartman is pacing the floor talking to someone on a mobile phone. No one is near him
Cartman
No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I [POP. Cartman looks around, then drops the phone and runs to the source of the pop. Butters has fired the gun again. Cartman runs up to him] What happened?!
Butters
They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
Cartman
Butters
Uh, not exactly.
SWAT Officer
[his hands over his bloodied crotch] Ow. Oh, it stings. Ohhhh. [Cartman's eyelids drop halfway and he looks at Butters. Butters looks back and Cartman glances away]
Butters
Well it's not where I aimed, honest.
Cartman
Dude...
Butters
I seriously didn't mean it.
Cartman
Dude! [Butters looks to his right and down] You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. [walks off]
Butters
What? Uh where are you going, Eric?
Cartman
[near the front doors, turns around and jabs a finger at Butters] You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
Butters
By, by my, by myself?
Cartman
I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass. [walks out of the restaurant in defeat towards the waiting officers] That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
Captain
Go inside! Move! [the officers rush the restaurant]
A camera pans from the sky down towards a mansion. Deputies drive up in their cruisers and run to the front door. One of them pounds on the front door
Deputy 1
George Lucas and Steven Spielberg! We have a warrant for your arrest! [there's no response. He looks at another deputy] Break it in! [the second deputy kicks the doors in and leads the other deputies inside. They search the mansion until they reach the library, where they enter and suddenly stop. They all gasp.]
Deputy 2
My God. [Lucas is raping a man dressed as a Stormtrooper]
Spielberg
Heey, what, what the hell are you doin' here?! [Lucas stops. Moments later, Spielberg and Lucas are led out of the mansion.] You've got nothin' on us! Seven hundred million box office!
Lucas
Hm this is bullshit!
Stormtrooper
[runs away like a chicken] Weeee! Weeee!
Park County Police Station. The boys await any updates about the arrest of Spielberg and Lucas. Yates and Mitch enter the waiting room
Det. Yates
Boys, we got 'em.
Kyle
What?
Det. Yates
[puts his hands on his hips] Spielberg and Lucas, they were... raping a Stormtrooper when the police broke in.
Mitch
And they found the dead raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round in their closet. [crosses his arms] They'll never be free to do this again. [the boys gather around the officers]
Stan
So, what now?
Jimmy
Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?
Clyde
What do we do?
Kyle
We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
P.F. Chang's, day. The diners are all out of the restaurant. Cartman and Butters are in the middle of the street. The police still have their weapons aimed at them
Captain
Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.
Father
There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail!
Captain
Officer 1
Sir! Sir, it's over. They got 'em.
Captain
Got who?
Officer 1
Spielberg and Lucas, they... finally got them for what they did to Indiana Jones, sir. [the captain lowers his gone and suddenly hugs the officer gratefully]
Captain
[softly] Hohhh, they got them.
Officer 2
They got 'em. It's over.
Officer 3
It's over. [they hug each other]
Father
That means... they'll never be free to rape again.
Waiter
It's over its over. [everyone weeps in relief and cry out "They got 'em." Most of them hug each other]
Officer 4
I love you.
Officer 5
I love you too. [Cartman, with a cock of his head to the right, motions to Butters to move, and they walk away. As they walk, Cartman begins discarding his costume]
Butters
So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
Cartman
I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters. [turns aside] You think about it. [turns and walks away.]
Butters
[just stands there for a while] ...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. [walks off in a different direction]
End of The China Probrem

Breast Cancer Show Ever
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in class waiting for the bell to ring. Mr. Garrison enters with some books.
Mr. Garrison
Okay children, let's all take our seats. [the kids take their seats as Mr. Garrison approaches his desk and puts the books away] Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? [Clyde, Kyle, and Bradley take their seats and Wendy walks up to the front of the class. She turns to face the class and looks over at Mr. Garrison]
Wendy
[clears her throat] Thank you Mr. Garrison. [reads from her notes] Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer. [Cartman tries to contain his laughter, but it comes out anyway. Wendy is mad, but resumes her report.] An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- [Cartman again tries to contain his laughter]
Cartman
She said it again. [laughs]
Wendy
Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
Cartman
[enjoying his distraction] Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
Mr. Garrison
[lowers his head and rubs his right temple] Eric, for the love of Jesus...
Wendy
This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!
Cartman
Me? You're the one talking about killer titties. [Clyde contains a giggle] Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people. [holds his hands out as if grabbing at people] Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
Butters
I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
Wendy
Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
Mr. Garrison
[flatly] Eric, stop being offensive.
Cartman
I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
Wendy
[irritated] No you aren't!
Cartman
Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone. [the other boys laugh. He joins them] Dude, I'm on fire today!
The school hallway, later. Wendy puts up a Breast Cancer Awareness poster up next to the drinking fountain. Other kids walk here and there, and Cartman appears
Cartman
Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose. [points to the ceiling] Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof. [Wendy turns and glares at him. Cartman talks into an imaginary walkie talkie] "Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!" [Wendy suddenly gets in Cartman's face]
Wendy
What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
Cartman
Not at all. [cups his hands again as if they're killer titties] "Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!"
Wendy
[points to him] You'd better shut up [lowers her right arm] or I'll make you shut up!
Cartman
Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
Wendy
I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
Cartman
Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
Wendy
That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!
Cartman
[begins to act like a gangbanger] You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
Wendy
You think you're tough?
Cartman
[takes what looks like a gang pose] Whassup? [takes another one] Whassup?
Wendy
I'll smack the shit out of you!
Cartman
Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
Wendy
After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
Cartman
You're gonna fight me after school?
Wendy
That's right!
Cartman
You're a chick, dude.
Wendy
As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.
Cartman
[poses again] Oh, it's on, bitch!
Wendy
You're gonna [jabs at the floor for emphasis] fucking die! [turns and walks away. Cartman strikes a few more poses]
Butters
Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody! [goes forth to spread the news. He walks by Stan, Kyle, and Bebe] Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
Stan
What?
Bebe
Wow. [goes forth to spread the news among the girls. She walks into the girls' bathroom and announces] Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
Girls
[separately] Really? Wow.
The kindergarten room. Kindergartners are playing with toys when Ike walks in
Ike
[faltering a bit] Wendy and Cartman are fighting after school. [the other kindergartners jump for joy]
Kindergartners
Yaaay!
South Park Elementary, behind the cafeteria. The Goth kids are idling around. Henrietta is reading from her book
Red
[opens the door and says] Hey emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school. [goes back inside and closes the door]
Pete
[flips his hair out of his eyes] Did she just call us emos?
The cafeteria. Most of the kids are eating lunch. At the center table are eight boys: Kenny, Clyde, Cartman, Butters, Jimmy, Token, Craig, and Jason
Butters
Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
Token
She is pissed off.
Cartman
She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
Clyde
[taps Cartman twice on the right arm] Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down. [Cartman leans to the right a bit to get a better view. Craig, Token, and Jimmy look back at the table behind them. Wendy stares back. There are six other girls at her table: Bebe to her right, Lola and Heidi to her left, Esther opposite Bebe, Anne opposite Lola, and Millie opposite Heidi. There's no one seated opposite Wendy, so she has a clear view. Bebe leans over and whispers something to her. Cartman smiles, but the smile turns into worry] She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.
Cartman
Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. [Cartman looks at Wendy again, and Wendy stares back. She makes a fist with her right hand and punches the open palm of her left hand.]
Jimmy
Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
Butters
Yeah, heh. [grabs his milk carton] If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. [takes a sip of milk through a straw and sets the carton down. Cartman begins to panic, looks around, and looks again at Wendy. Her face becomes the only thing he sees]
South Park Elementary, after lunch. In the hallway, Wendy puts away her books. Cartman finds her and walks up to her
Cartman
Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
Wendy
What?!
Cartman
[almost whispering] Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
Wendy
What?
Cartman
[takes her aside and whispers] I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
Wendy
If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
Cartman
[takes her aside further and whispers] Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
Wendy
No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!
Cartman
[seeing the unwanted attention] Pfft, apologize?! [begins to strike poses] That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
Wendy
Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
Cartman
Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
Wendy
I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
Cartman
[trying to put up a front] Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo. [Wendy goes back to her locker, the other kids go their separate ways. Wendy shuts her locker door and Cartman races up to her again. He whispers] Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
Wendy
Get away from me! [walks away]
Another part of the hallway. The Goth kids are walking along and notice Stan at his locker. They approach him
Michael
So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend.
Stan
I guess so.
Pete
And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? [flips his hair]
Michael
Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends.
Stan
What am I supposed to do about it? [Craig and Jimmy walk up to him]
Craig
Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.
Jimmy
I'll bet she is!
Butters
[walks into view] Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! [performs some punching moves]
Another part of the hallway. Wendy's walking along when a door opens to her left
Cartman
[peers out from the doorway] Wendy. Wendy psst.
Wendy
What?!
Cartman
Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick. [Wendy goes into the room Cartman was hiding in, which is a storage room. Once inside, she looks around, taking it all in.] Wendy, you're not gonna believe this. [She turns and glares at him] I just found out my mom has breast cancer. [she glares harder] Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
Wendy
You really think that's gonna work on me?!
Cartman
Wendy, [pulls out a letter-sized envelope] I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
Wendy
You can't bribe your way out of this!
Cartman
[puts his left hand up to hold her back] Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
Wendy
No you don't.
Cartman
[thinks for a moment] My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
Wendy
You don't get it, asshole! [shoves him back a bit] There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!
Cartman
Eat my underwear?
Wendy
That's right.
Cartman
[walks a few steps away] Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
Wendy
Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
Cartman
No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
Wendy
You fucking suck so hard!!
Cartman
I'll eat my underwear, Wendy. [unzips his pants.] And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
Wendy
What are you doing?! [Cartman takes off his underwear]
Cartman
I'm committed to peace, Wendy. [begins to swallow his underwear] I want you to see just how humbled I am... [gags]
Wendy
Ew! [looks away]
Cartman
[rather muffled] Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy. [tries one last swallow and succeeds] There. Yeahm.
Wendy
Oh my God!
Cartman
So... [turns to face her] are we cool?
Wendy
No!
Cartamn
I ate my underwear! [advances. Wendy backs up] What the hell do you want from me?! [advances again. Wendy backs up, then runs around Cartman towards the door. He can't turn fast enough to match her] Weh-
Wendy
[opens the door] You are so pathetic!
Cartman
[throws himself at her mercy] Wendy it isn't fair! [she runs out of there quickly] I ate my underwear for you! Nooo! [Craig walks by and stops to look in] Yo, what's up dawg?
The boys' bathroom. Stan enters. Cartman rushes in behind him
Cartman
Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
Stan
What?
Cartman
You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
Stan
Yeah?
Cartman
Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
Stan
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. [moves towards the stalls, but Cartman runs up ahead of him and stops him]
Cartman
Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
Stan
Really?
Cartman
You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said "Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone." But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way- [his gag reflex kicks in and his underwear come back up his throat and out his mouth. Stan looks on a bit stunned as Cartman pulls his underwear the rest of the way out, then glances back and forth at his underwear and at Stan] Oh, that's where I put those. [puts his underwear into a back pocket] Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
Stan
Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
Cartman
[runs to Stan's left, by the sinks] God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! [his underwear is hanging from his right hand. Cartman notices, then runs out of the bathroom. Stan looks down helplessly]
South Park Elementary, near the end of the school day. Garrison is at the front of the class giving a lecture
Mr. Garrison
And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle. [Cartman glances at the clock on the wall: 2:58 p.m. His fingers drum the desk softly as he looks ahead blankly remembering Wendy's words: "I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone!" Then Butters': "If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot."] All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... [Cartman begins to block everything out except Wendy and the wall clock: 2:58 p.m. Wendy's ready to fight.]
Bebe
Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!
Jimmy
As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. [As the wall clock draws towards 3 p.m. Cartman thinks "There's no way out. She's gonna kick my ass in front of everyone."]
Butters
Almost time. [smiles]
Mr. Garrison
And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
Clyde
I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.
Cartman
[a revelation] Detention! That's it! [begins to fidget: "I've gotta get detention, fast!" The minute hand hits 0 and Cartman runs out of his seat towards the front of the class. He gets on Mr. Garrison's desk, shoves the Homework Assignments holder off the desk, lowers his pants, and leaves a nice brown gift on the desk. Mr. Garrison looks at him. The class is stunned as Cartman looks back at Mr. Garrison]
Mr. Garrison
Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
Cartman
[strikes some gang poses] Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? [Wendy's especially shocked. No one says a word until...]
Butters
[cocks his head to his right] Huh.
The school library. Five kids are in detention there, and Mr. Mackey is looking after them
Mr. Mackey
Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. [walks away]
Cartman
[puts his feet up on the table and his hands behind his head, certain he's gotten out of the fight with Wendy] Ahhh, sweet.
Butters
[a door opens and his voice is heard] Eric. Hey Eric. [the camera shows Butters motioning Cartman over. Craig and Jimmy are behind him. Cartman looks over at them, then leaves his seat and walks to the door] Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
Cartman
What?! That's ridiculous!
Butters
But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
Cartman
That's not why I did it.
Craig
Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?
Cartman
[begins to pose] Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
Butters
That's what I said. I told everyone outside, "Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!"
Cartman
Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
Craig
Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.
Jimmy
Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
Cartman
[shocked] Huh?
Butters
That way it won't matter if you get detention.
Mr. Mackey
[finds him] Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!
Jimmy
Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ! [they walk away and the doors close. Cartman stands there for a moment, then returns to his seat. There's a rapping at the window and Cartman looks over]
Wendy
[outside] Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning! [walks away. Cartman is truly scared]
Wendy's room, night. She's doing math homework
Mrs. Testaburger
Wendy?
Wendy
Yeah?
Mrs. Testaburger
We need to talk to you, right now. [Wendy leaves her chair and her room, and goes downstairs. Her parents are waiting for her, quite displeased and upset as they confront their daughter] Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school?
Wendy
What? No!
Mrs. Testaburger
Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us? [Wendy looks and sees Cartman and Liane seated on the sofa. Cartman is sobbing quietly] Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up?!
Wendy
You don't understand. He said horrible things.
Cartman
[whining] The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him]
Mrs. Testaburger
Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?
Cartman
The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. [cries into Liane's sweater. She soothes him again]
Mrs. Testaburger
Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him!
Wendy
Mom, you don't-
Mrs. Testaburger
Now, young lady.
Wendy
I'm not going to hurt you.
Mr. Testaburger
If there is any word of you fighting at school it's over for you, missy! Do you understand?!
Wendy
Yes sir.
Mrs. Testaburger
We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman.
Liane
Oh no, thank you so much for your time. [Cartman looks at Wendy, then makes faces at her and sticks both middle fingers up at her. Wendy gets pissed off, but can't do anything now]
Mrs. Testaburger
It won't happen again.
Liane
You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. [stops making faces and looks up at her, then joins her as she walks to the front door]
Cartman
Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
South Park Elementary, before school. The fourth graders are all there, with Cartman front and center. Craig and Butters stand by his side as he faces the road
Butters
Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
Cartman
Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
Bebe
Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
An Older Girl
Here she comes! [everyone looks to their right and see Wendy approaching.]
Cartman
[begins to strike poses as Wendy walks by] What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
Wendy
[stops and looks at him] You know I can't fight you!
Cartman
Why not? You chicken? [begins to strut and cluck like a chicken]
Wendy
I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
Cartman
Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
Butters
Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
Cartman
I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
Bebe
Come on Wendy, kick his ass!
Wendy
I can't! [the school bell rings and she walks towards the building] God damn it!
Butters
She chickened out!
Other students
Aw man. [they follow her into the building and towards class]
Cartman
Told you guys.
Stan
Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.
Pete
[walking by with the other Goths] Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.
Jimmy
I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
Mr. Garrison's class, morning. Clyde is presenting his report before the class
Clyde
And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. [the class applauds politely as he takes his seat. Wendy has her face buried in her arms]
Mr. Garrison
Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go? [Cartman smiles and silently raises his hand] Okay Eric. [Cartman happily gets out of his seat and goes to face the class]
Cartman
[clears his throat] Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness. [Wendy lifts her head up in surprise] I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest. [stifles a laugh] We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. [stifles a laugh again]
Wendy
[softly] You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
Cartman
What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey
Mr. Garrison
Okay Eric, that's enough you smartass!
Wendy
Why?! [leaves her seat and walks up to Cartman] Why are you doing this to me?! [grabs him by the collar and shakes him] Why won't you just stop?!
Cartman
[cautioning] Wendy, Wendy.
Principal Victoria
[through the school's PA system] Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.
Wendy
God! [Cartman cackles as she leaves]
The Principal's office, moments later. Wendy stands before Principal Victoria
Principal Victoria
Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.
Wendy
No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.
Principal Victoria
Oh no? Are you sure?
Wendy
Yes ma'am!
Principal Victoria
I see. [gets up and walks to the window and looks out] I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?
Wendy
Ma'am?
Principal Victoria
I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed. [Faces Wendy] When there is a cancer, you have to "fight" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.
Wendy
[thinks a moment] My... parents said that if I fight-
Principal Victoria
And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you. [turns back to the window] You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will [turns back to Wendy] take everything. Do you understand?
Wendy
[the look of determination appears on her face and she makes her hands into fists] Yes ma'am!
Principal Victoria
When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!
The hallway. Bebe bursts through some doors and walks down the hall
Bebe
She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
Millie
What? [the other kids in the hall turn and everyone heads outside. Other classes hear about this and clear out, chattering all the while. Wendy leads the pack towards the playground. While still in the building she takes off her jacket and throws it aside. On her blouse is a purple prancing unicorn connected to some orange stars by a yellow rainbow]
The playground. Cartman and the other boys toss the football at each other.
Cartman
Go deep, Craig. [throws the football at Craig, who is off-screen] Not that deep, retard!
Butters
[runs up to Cartman smiling] She's coming! She's coming!
Cartman
Butters, get out of here!
Butters
But Wendy's coming to fight you.
Cartman
[in disbelief] ...Huh? [Butters turns left and looks at the building, smiling. Cartman looks to his right. The side doors fly open and Wendy walks down the steps spoiling for a fight. The students cheer her on as she turns left and heads for the playground. Some girls trail behind her, Bebe being the first among them.]
Clyde
Oh boy here we go!
Butters
All right! [other kids chatter around them. The Goth kids find some good spots along the brick wall. Red Goth and Kindergoth sit atop the wall, Tall Goth and Henrietta remain on the ground next to it]
Pete
It's about freaking time. [Wendy walks up to Cartman and they face off]
Craig
All right, let's DO IT!
Cartman
[wavering] What- what's up? [begins posing] What what's up? [draws close to her and cautions in a whisper] Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
Wendy
I don't care! [Cartman looks around. Butters gleefully dances in place waiting for the fight to start]
Cartman
Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
A Girl
Shut up and fight! [everyone else joins in the demand. Wendy ties her hair up in a small bun behind her head]
Cartman
Alright, fine Wendy! I'll fight you, you big bully! [takes off his jacket and tosses it aside]
The fighters dance around each other until Wendy lands a right cross. Cartman spins around and falls on his back. Wendy dances around and Cartman stands up, pulling up his pants in the process. Wendy lands two left jabs on Cartman's face, and Cartman finally responds with a right punch. It's strong enough to make Wendy stagger backwards
Kids
Ohhhhh!
Cartman lands another punch on Wendy's face, then continues with a series of alternating punches, forcing Wendy backwards and into the crowd. Cartman lands a punch strong enough to send Wendy into the jungle gym, then continues punching her there. Wendy eventually catches one of his punches and outmuscles him, throwing Cartman into the jungle gym, then driving his face into one of the bars at least twice, and Cartman begins to bleed. The crowd is loving it, cheering her on. Wendy now delivers a long series of alternating punches, forcing Cartman back across the playground and into a hobby elephant. Cartman puts his arms up to deflect the punches, but it's ineffective.
Butters
Fuck him up, Wendy!
Cartman finally tosses Wendy off him and throws a punch at her, but she punches faster, making him miss. She then punches him on the right temple, and Cartman wobbles a bit. As he recovers, Wendy delivers the finishing blow: a fierce right cross that turns Cartman's head around and sends his body flying. The scene is frozen in time and the various reactions are shown: Stan, Kyle, Tweek, and Jimmy are cheering Wendy on. Jimmy has his right crutch up in the air, cheering. Butters is swooning while the boys around him just watch the fight. Time speeds up and Cartman falls to the ground, losing a tooth. Wendy kicks him a few times for good measure. She runs out of strength, staggers backwards, and drops down on her ass, exhausted.
Mr. Mackey
[just arriving] Wendy?
Wendy
[pants and looks back at Mr. Mackey] I'm finished! [gets up and walks away. The girls look at her with astonishment]
Mr. Mackey
Eh somebod - somebody call the principal! [Cartman gets up, sniffling. Some of the kids begin to leave. Cartman looks around]
Cartman
[demoralized] You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag. [begins to wail] My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. [wails some more]
Stan
Dude, we never thought you were cool.
Cartman
That's not true. You're just saying that.
Kyle
No, really. We've always thought you suck.
Jimmy
Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
Cartman
You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
Carig
No, it's true. We've always hated you.
Butters
Well, yeah.
Cartman
Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. [the guys look at each other, sure that Cartman misunderstood them]
Craig
What?
Cartman
[seeing a positive side to this somehow] If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief! [jumps up and clicks his feet up in the air] Oh, yay! [jumps up again]
End of Breast Cancer Show Ever

Pandemic
South Park Mall, day. The boys wait for Kenny, who is coming out of Walstien's with his purchase. Once he arrives, the boys move out into the open mall area and turn left.
Kyle
I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
Kenny
(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)
Cartman
Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
Kenny
('Cause girls like shaved balls.)
Kyle
Girls like shaved balls?
Kenny
(Yes they do.)
Cartman
What girl is gonna see your balls?
Kenny
(Well I don't know.) [Something grabs Stan's attention and he stops and looks to his right.]
Stan
[pissed off] Oh Jesus, there's another one! [the other boys stop and look. A Peruvian pan flute band plays and draws a small crowd] Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? [the band has a bombo drummer, a siku player, and two charango players]
Cartman
Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
Stan
I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
Kyle
I think Kenny likes it. [Kenny's groovin' to the music]
Stan
[turns left and leaves] I gotta get home for dinner.
Cartman
[follows] Yeah, me too. [Kyle follows Cartman and Kenny keeps dancing.]
South Park Mall, exterior. The boys exit the mall. Kenny catches up to them. The camera pulls back to reveal another band.
Stan
[pumping his fists] God!
Cartman
Shut up already!
Stan
I'm outta here; see ya guys. [leaves. Kyle and Cartman follow and Kenny dances again]
Stan's house, night. He walks in through the front door and to the sofa, where he finds Shelly watching TV.
TV
Tonight, the Travel Channel takes you to London! [the London skyline is shown. A British flag floats across the screen] London has something for everyone! Sights! [a pillar topped by a statue] Theater, and wonderful street performers! [the picture pans down to reveal a pan flute band playing to the crowd]
Stan
They're in London too?
Sharon
Hey, time for dinner guys. [Shelly turns off the TV and joins Stan to the dining room]
The dining room. Sharon arrives with a bowl of fruit as Stan and Shelly take their seats on either side of the table. Sharon has already set their meals on the table. Today's meal? Potatoes au gratin.
Sharon
All right kids, dig in.
Stan
Where's dad?
Sharon
[irritated] He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
Stan
Why?
Sharon
Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
Randy
[arrives and starts shooting] All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. [moves around to Stan's side of the table, shooting video all the while]
Sharon
Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
Randy
[points the camera at Shelly] There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
Shelly
Turn it off, Dad!
Randy
[swoops around to Shelly's side to get a better shot] Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. [takes a quick look at the screen attached to the camera, to adjust the aim. A second later and pan flute music is heard. Stan looks around and locates the source. He walks to a front window and sees a pan flute band playing across the street. In front of them is a briefcase full of CDs]
Stan
Oh Jesus Christ! [Randy walks up behind him with the camera]
Randy
Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. [Stan just glances at him]
Kyle's house, next day. Kenny and Cartman are with him playing Candyland on the living room floor.
Cartman
I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces... [moves Kyle's piece back seven spaces and softly says] ...screw you Kyle. [normal voice] Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. [tosses the dice to him]
Stan
You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
Cartman
So?
Stan
So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
Cartman
How much?
Stan
Over two hundred bucks.
Kyle
Two hundred dollars?
Cartman
Really? Are you sure?
Stan
Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! [the other boys stay quiet]
Kyle
...Become a Peruvian flute band?
Stan
Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
Cartman
[stands up] Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
Stan
Yeah!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Kyle
But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? [the boys give it some thought]
Craig's house, moments later. The four boys are at the front door ringing the doorbell. The door opens and Craig appears.
Cartman
Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
Craig
...Fine.
Cartman
Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
Craig
...Yeah.
Stan
Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? [Craig stays quiet, so Cartman prevails upon him and enters his house]
Craig's living room.
Cartman
Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
Craig
What do you guys want?
Kyle
[enters with Stan and Kenny] Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
Cartman
[applauds] All right Craig! [pats him on the back]
Craig
You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
Stan
There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
Cartman
And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
Craig
[assessing the situation] You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
Cartman
Craig, don't be an asshole.
Craig
[turns right and walks past Cartman] I'll go get the money. [the boys grin. Stan and Kenny high-five each other.]
South Park Mall, day, by the fountain. The five boys now gather in their costumes with their instruments. Cartman plays the siku, Stan and Kyle play charangos, Kenny plays on a home-made bombo while Craig has a new stringed instrument.
Stan
All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
Cartman
And a one, and a two, and a- [the boys launch into their rendition of "Mary Had A Little Lamb"]
Man 1
Wow, that's such cultural music.
Man 2
Very cultural, yes.
Cartman
[as the men leave] Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. [in their briefcase are $10 CDs from their band, the Llama Brothers, "Tapas and Moonscapes". Man 1 whips out a fresh $10 bill and buys a CD]
Kyle
Gracias.
Woman 1
[walks by and stops to check out the CDs] How cultural. [buys one for herself]
Kyle
This is awesome!
Stan
Ya see, Craig? [another band starts up nearby and Stan steps forward for a better look. The boys look to their right]
Cartman
Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! [leads the other boys to the competing band]
Stan
Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. [the other band ignores them and continues playing]
Cartman
No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
Stan
This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! [the other band looks at them for a few seconds, then resumes its music, its members grinning.]
Kyle
God damn it!
Cartman
No! No es bueno! [grabs the siku and throws it away. The band stops playing. The siku player looks at his empty hands and goes after the siku]
Stan
Come on, guys. [the boys return to their spot and start playing again, but another band begins to play off to their left]
Stan
Jesus Christ!
Cartman
No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Michael Chertoff
Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions. I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands. [the audience members begin to talk amongst themselves. Chertoff activates the screen behind him, and a world map appears onscreen.] The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are. All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer. General?
Chief Aide
[walks into view before the screen] France, Japan, and the northeastern United States are currently the hardest hit. Make no mistake: [sticks an index finger up] this is a pan flute epidemic.
Senator 1
A pan-demic?
Michael Chertoff
Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through.
Senator 2
Excuse me, but... aid other countries?
Michael Chertoff
Senator?
Senator 2
With all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands! Let other countries fend for themselves!
Michael Chertoff
[starting soft and with rising voice, he leaves the podium and faces the senator] You heartless bastard! This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity! And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands! Is that clear?! [the senator collapses back into his seat and begins to cry and Chertoff returns to the podium] As director of Homeland Security, I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained.
South Park Mall, day. The third Peruvian flute band continues to play and a woman stops by. She begins to dance. Some helicopters are heard and one appears over the crowd.
Paratrooper:
Go, go! [all kinds of law enforcement and military vehicles rush in and surround the mall. Hazmat officers pour out of a Hazmat truck. Inside, the boys now play "Three Blind Mice". A woman stops by and buys a CD. The boys hear some commotion and look over: military troops surround the second band and subdue it]
Cartman
Ha! [sticks his right middle finger up] Serves you right, assholes! [behind them the third band is subdued]
Soldier 1
One more over here! [the boys are surrounded and subdued]
Soldier 2
Let's go! Get 'em out!
Soldier 3
Clear out, move! This is a Homeland Security operation, people, let's go!
Stan
Hey, back off!
Solider 3
Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained! [Hazmat officers collect the CDs slowly, gingerly]
Stan's house, day. Randy is in the living room taking more video of Sharon and Shelly while they sit on the sofa.
Randy
There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly. [neither female responds to him] What are you watching, guys?
Sharon
[irritated] The news.
Randy
[draws even closer to her] Huh?
Sharon
[irritated] We're watching the news.
Randy
[turns the camera towards the TV] That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now. [moves around to Shelly's side] What do you think about the television, Shelly? [Shelly remains quiet as Randy glances at the TV] Oh, the news is starting! [starts taking video of that]
CNN Breaking News
Anchorman Tom
The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day. [Times Square in New York is shown, with more bands being arrested] In cities all over the world [a shot of St. Louis] flute bands have been removed and quarantined. [a shot of Seattle] But more may still be out there. Homeland Security's requesting that [a graphic appears that says pretty much the following] if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it. Mark down the flute band's location, and do not, under any circumstances, buy their CDs. [the reporter reappears onscreen] The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in Miami
Peruvian Flute Band Internment Camp, brought to you by the Department of Homeland Security, in Miami. More Peruvian bands join the already large crowd of bands there. The boys are among them.
Stan
Eh-excuse us. Hello? [spots a soldier in one of the watchtowers] Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
Kyle
Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
Guard
Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs!
Stan
No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
Guard
I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it!
A Musician
[walks into view] Señor? Comprar CD la musica? [the soldier kills him with a few blasts from his automatic rifle]
Kenny
(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)
Peruvian Flute Band Internment Camp, that night. The Peruvian flute bands play, and trashcans have been set ablaze to keep them warm. The camera pans to the boys, who sit around a small campfire moping around
Craig
"Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole." [some alarms go off for a few seconds, then fall silent as Chertoff appears above the crowd with a blond translator to his left]
Michael Chertoff
Attention Peruvian flute bands
Translator
Atencione bandas de flauta Perú.
Michael Chertoff
We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
Translator
Cooperacion y peciencia es apreciado.
Michael Chertoff
Tomorrow you will be boarding ships...

Mañana sera el embarque de barcos...
Michael Chertoff
...which will take you to Guantanamo Bay.
Translator

Michael Chertoff
There you will spend the rest of your lives.
Translator
Donde pasar el resto de sus vidas. Gracias! [they turn and head inside. The Peruvian flute bands break up behind the boys and head back to their business]
Kyle
Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
Stan
Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
The Marsh house. Craig's parents are seated on the sofa. Kyle's parents and Sharon are standing.
Sharon
Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?
Mrs. Tucker
No, I'm telling you. This isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried.
Mr. Tucker
You've checked with the police?
Gerald
Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
Sharon
None of the other kids have seen them since a- [notice Randy taping them] Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!
Randy
Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
Sharon
Well then stop being an idiot and help!
Mr. Tucker
Maybe the boys all ran away. Were any of your boys upset about anything?
Gerald
All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
Sheila
That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
Mrs. Tucker
What is that supposed to mean?
Sharon
To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.
Mrs. Tucker
[quiet for a few seconds] Now wait just a minute!
Sharon
I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-
Mr. Tucker
Like every kid doesn't have some problems!
Sheila
Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
Mrs. Tucker
Oh my God
Mr. Tucker
This is ridiculous!
Randy
[filming the argument] Ohhh this is good!
Gerlad
That's not ridicul-
Peruvian Flute Band Internment Camp, day. Michael Chertoff stands among some soldiers and DHS officials
Soldier 4
Sir, good news! Looks like we did it. Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands. We got 'em all! [other soldiers cry out "All right! We did it!"]
Michael Chertoff
Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again!
Official 1
We don't know where they came from, sir. We... we've been researching, but we... can't figure it out.
Michael Chertoff
Well think about it, idiot! Where else would "Peruvian" flute bands come from? [everyone else mulls it over]
Official 1
Hmm...
Michael Chertoff
The country is in the name!
Official 2
No. Sir, we checked the entire map. There isn't a country called Peruvian anywhere.
Michael Chertoff
Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here! [points to the country on a world map]
Official 3
Peh-roo.
Michael Chertoff
Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all!
Official 1
Is that really necessary, sir? It seems a little extreme.
Soldier 2
Yeah.
Michael Chertoff
Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us [pounds his right fist onto his left palm] unless they are stopped at the source!
Chief Aide
Sir, you'd better come quick. One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape.
Michael Chertoff
[grabs Official 2 by his tie] See? [lets go and leaves] God damn it! [they higher officials walk out behind him]
The interrogation room, moments later. Chertoff and his chief aide are grilling the boys, who are seated in a row behind a table. Two top officials stand out of the way nearby
Michael Chertoff
[holds the CD the boys were carrying] The Llama Brothers: Tapas and Moodscapes.
Stan
This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
Michael Chertoff
Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band.
Stan
We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
Kyle
We just wanna go home.
Kenny
(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)
Michael Chertoff
Which tourist location were they playing at?
Chief Aide
An outdoor mall in Colorado.
Kyle
Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
Stan
We we speak English!
Cartman
And we're white.
Michael Chertoff
Let me talk to you guys out here. [takes his chief aide and the two other officials into the observation room and closes the door.] Well what do you think?
Chief Aide
I don't know what to make of it sir. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they... aren't. They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like ...one of us.
Michael Chertoff
I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid.
Official 1
A hybrid? Ah how is that possible?
Chief Aide
Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females. Who knows?
Michael Chertoff
Well however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had. [walks to the one-way window]
Official 1
Sir?
Michael Chertoff
If they are the hybrid we're talking about, [puts his left arm up high against the window and presses his head against that] then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all.
The interrogation room. The boys wait for the officials to return
Craig
Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you? [the other boys look at each other] Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
Cartman
You're being extremely negative, Craig. [Chertoff and the others return]
Michael Chertoff
[approaches the boys] All right, here's the deal: Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us... we'll get you home.
stan
Help you how?
Michael Chertoff
[walks around the table and the boys] You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands. They see you as one of them. We are going to send you to their Capital.
Craig
Can we please just go home, sir?
Michael Chertoff
[drops the CD onto the table] We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning.
Kyle
No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! [almost falls apart, but Stan grabs him and holds him in place]
Stan
Kyle, calm down.
Kyle
You know I can't go there, Stan!
Stan
One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. [the officials look at each other]
Michael Chertoff
You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.
Peruvian Flute Band Internment Camp, Paruvian flute bands are crowded near the fence staring outside with one solder in front of the fence.
Soldier 3
Thompson, can you come over here? [the translator from earlier walks up to him] The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them.
Musician 2
¡Por favor! ¡No podemos ir! ¡Estamos aquí para proteger a ustedes!
Musician 3
Sí.
Other Musicians
Sí. No podemos ir. Si, protectores.
Thompson
They're saying something like, "You can't send us away. We are the protectors."
Soldier 3
Protectors from what?
Musician 2
¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda!
Soldier 3
What does that mean?
Thompson
I think he said, "the furry death"?
Musician 2
¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda!
CNN Breaking News
Announcer
[gruffly] This is CNN.
Anchorman Tom
The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world. Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect.
Paul Harris
Really welcome silence, Tom. There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now, and everyone is really enjoying the peace. The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the- [a low moan is heard and a heavy footfall shakes the ground. The camera looks around for the source of the shaking] What the?! [an explosion has the camera focus on the resulting burst of fire]
Woman 2
[voice only] Oh my Gohhhd!
Woman 3
[voice only] Ohmigod! [a police car flies through the air from the direction of the blast.]
Paul Harris
Jesus Christ! [the police car lands between him and the water fountain upside down. Harris ducks down]
Shopper
AAAAHHH!! [Harris gets up again and looks at the damage]
Paul Harris
There's, there's something else here, it's... [the camera switches to the police car again] It's not a Peruvian flute band, it's a... Oh my God what is that thing?! [points to the sky, but the camera doesn't follow it]
Anchorman Tom
Paul Paul, what do you see?
Paul Harris
It's furry! It's very furry! [the transmission flickers, then fades out]
Anchorman Tom
Okay obviously something different has uh shown up a-... Did he say "furry"? [instantly another heavy footfall rattles the CNN newsroom and shorts out several monitors. Reporters and other worker scatter around] Okay uh we're we're experiencing some uh- [a second footfall shuts down the newsroom entirely and tilts the camera one way, but it's still airing. A third footfall tilts the camera in another direction and the roof is peeled back. A shaft of light strikes Tom's head as he looks up into the night] My God what is that thing?! [a fourth footfall tilts the camera down and in still another direction. Tom is lifted into the air...] AAAHHH!! [...and the camera finally stops transmitting, leaving behind an image of static, then nothing.]
The sky, night. A military airplane take to the air. Inside, the four boys sit on chairs in one side of the cabin. The pilot peeks in and then walks towards them.
Pilot
All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru. There'll be a truck to take you inside the border where you're briefed on mission specifics. [walks backwards into the cockpit and closes the door. The boys say nothing for a while]
Craig
Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said "Hey, you know? This plan might backfire." [no answer] No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
Kyle
That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
Stan
Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
Craig
[testing] I'm being a dick?
Stan
[firmly] Yes!
Craig
You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?
Cartman
There's no talking to this guy.
Stan
All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
Craig
That would be great. Thank you.
Kyle
This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
Kenny
(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
Kyle
Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
Stan's house, night. Sharon is talking to someone on the phone
Sharon
Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you. [*click* She notices that Randy videotaped the call] Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!
Randy
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
Sharon
[the scene continues with Randy's POV] I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! [a low moan is heard. She stops and looks around, getting more afraid with each moan]
Randy
What the hell was that? [a heavy footfall shorts out the house]
Sharon
Oh my God.
Randy
Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! [turns around and runs out]
Shelly
[coming down the stairs] What's going on, Dad? [Randy wheels around to see her]
Randy
Get back to your room, Shelly! [turns around and goes to the front door. He opens it and sees people running all over the street in a panic, He then points his camera at some helicopters overhead]
On the street. Randy steps out of the house and runs into Mr. Garrison.
Randy
What's going on?
Mr. Garrison
They're all over the place!
Randy
What are?!
Mr. Garrison
They're really furry! [runs off. Randy joins the others out on the street. He hears someone above him and points the camera to catch a man falling from the sky. A chunk of his body has been bitten off, exposing ribs on the right side]
Randy
What did that?! [moves his camera off the body and sees more people running. A giant guinea pig appears among the panicked residents] What is that thing?! [someone taps him from behind and he turns around to see who it is. Officer Barbrady appears on camera]
Officer Barbrady
Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! [a house blows up and Randy starts running, his camera aimed at his feet. He aims his camera forward again and sees people rounding the corner and running his way. Linda Stotch is one of them.]
Linda
AAAAAAAAH!! [Two heavy footfalls follow and a car flies through the air from left to right. Another giant guinea pig walks along the crossroad towards the mangled car]
Randy
Oh my Gohhhd!
Stephen
[getting Randy's attention] Go go go go back the other way! [Randy runs back along the street, the camera again aimed at his feet. He stops and aims the camera at himself]
Randy
[out of breath] Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God. [pants] Oh God. [pants] I'm [pants] I'm so [pants] Startled.
A Woman
[voice only] Oh my Gohhhd! [Randy stops panting and looks to his left.]
Randy
HAAA! [A growl is heard and all of a sudden his camera goes dark.]
The Department of Homeland Security Headquarters. Michael Chertoff is back in the auditorium looking at the world map.
Chief Aide
[entering] Sir? We've got a bigger problem.
Michael Chertoff
[smiles knowingly] Oh? And what might that be?
Chief Aide
New reports are coming in from cities all over the world. Word of massive destruction and death by what ap-pear to be... [Chertoff turns around and smiles at him]
Michael Chertoff
[hiding a folder behind his back] Guinea pigs?
Chief Aide
[softly] Yes sir. How did you know?
Michael Chertoff
You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that?
Davis
Sir?
Michael Chertoff
I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.
Davis
You... You... knew this was going to happen.
Michael Chertoff
Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere. [his face becomes monstrous. His tongue shoots out and stabs Davis in the right eye. Davis goes into convulsions for a long time, but finally dies. Chertoff releases his tongue's grip and it goes back into his mouth] Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen. The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere. [he looks at the folder he had behind his back. Attached to it is a picture... of Craig]

Some recaps of last week's episode. Randy filming scared residents running by, a cameraman filming a police car being thrown into South Park Mall
YOU ARE NOT MEANT TO SEE
Shelly
What's going on, Dad? [cut to the fallen man with a chunk of flesh missing from his left side]
Officer Barbrady
Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- [cut to the power going out at CNN, then to an explosion, then to people running away from something, then the giant guinea pigs appearing, then to Linda Stotch panicking and running, then to a second car flying across an intersection, then to Randy looking into his camera]
Randy
[out of breath] Oh God. [pants] I'm- [pants] I'm so- [pants] Startled. [the camera cuts out on him] ARRRGH!
PANDEMIC 2
THE STARTLING
A picture of Craig appears as a Peruvian pan flute version of "Three Blind Mice" plays in the background
Craig
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday. [a picture of him, his family, and a grandmother standing behind a cake. Ten candles are on the cake. Balloons are all around and a "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" banner is above them] My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars. [a picture of that is shown] I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house [a shot of the four boys in Craig's living room] and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band. [a shot of the newly-formed band, the Llama Brothers] They promised I would double my money in one afternoon. [soldiers swoop in and apprehend them] But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami. [the camp is shown, followed by the five boys sitting in the interrogation room] We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru. [a shot of a DHS cargo plane with the boys sitting on the ground near it.] And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. [he sits on one suitcase, Kenny on another. The whole group is in a mountainous region of Peru]
Stan
We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
Kyle
Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
Cpt. Taylor
I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here.
Cpt. Gabriel
This is where they told us to land. Can you get through to Washington?
Cpt. Taylor
I'm trying. [...and gets through]
A Voice
This is Connor in Washington.
Cpt. Taylor
Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land.
Connor
Jesus they're everywhere!
Cpt. Taylor
What are everywhere?
Connor
...so furry! They're attacking... every city... ha- people dying... Ha-... guinea pigs... all over! Agh.
Stan
Guinea pigs?
Connor
Can't stop them! Need to get... out... ergh. I just ate... a peanut... Agh peanut now stuck... in throat... Urgh shouldn't eat peanut... when scared. [a few more groans and communication is cut]
A camera is restarted. Home furnishings are shown
Randy
I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again. [points it to himself] Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window... [aims it at the living room windows, through which you still see people running around in panic, then aims it at himself again] I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me, [moves the camera just enough to show Sharon] and there's Shelly. [Sharon is protecting her somewhat] Wave to the camera, Shelly.
Sharon
Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.
Randy
I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
Sharon
[stands up] We have to see what the news is saying. [walks over to the TV and turns it on. A shot of New York City appears.]
Reporter
[off camera] This is a shot of New York City where the... giant guinea pigs have also attacked.
Sharon
Guinea pigs?
Reporter
Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world.
Randy
Jesus, this thing is worldwide? [two giant guinea pigs suddenly come into view. The camera moves to a group of soldiers firing at a third guinea pig.]
Sharon
Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? [Randy focuses the camera on her. A loud thump is heard, knocking Randy off balance. He regains it and makes sure Sharon and Shelly are fine, then turns to the source of a growl: a giant guinea pig has broken through a wall and is now looking at the family]
Randy
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
Sharon
Go Randy, run! [Sharon takes Shelly out the front door. Randy follows them]
Randy
Gotta get out!
The Peruvian jungle high up in the Andes. The group is still in the makeshift landing strip. Cpt. Taylor is still trying to get a connection through the plane's radio, which is next to him outside
Cpt. Taylor
Michaels, Harrison, anybody? [no response] Nothing. LSAT is down and no answer at RCU. Whatever is going on out there is huge.
Stan
[steps forward] Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
Cpt. Taylor
...Yes, that was the order.
Kyle
And that makes sense to you?
Cpt. Taylor
Nope, not at all.
Cpt. Gabriel
Actually, the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either.
Stan
None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
Cpt. Taylor
Craig
Oh, that's awesome.
Kyle
So we've gotta find another way out of here.
Cpt. Taylor
It's starting to look that way, yeah.
The Peruvian jungle, later. The two pilots lead the boys through it.
Craig
This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
Cartman
You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Cartman
Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
Cpt. Gabriel
Look at that: no lights on, nothing. It's like, humans have never been to this part of Peru. [the camera zooms out and at least eight giant burrowing holes appear before them.]
U.S. Department of Homeland Security, strategic room. Chertoff looks at a map as an official briefs him on the current situation
Top Official
More guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions. We checked on Wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from the Andes Mountains, here. [points to the mountains]
Michael Chertoff
What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay?
Official 1
...Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands.
Michael Chertoff
Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?!
Official 2
No sir. We diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs.
Michael Chertoff
That was an order! [pounds both fists into the map table.] The pan flute bands were to be put on boats to Guantanamo last night! [pounds both fists into the map table again.] I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo!
Soldier 4
Yes sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people. [turns around and walks out sobbing]
South Park, night. Randy's got his camera rolling. Sharon and Shelly stand behind a door so they are not seen from the street.
Randy
Hey we're down in... Main Street now and... [a tank rolls by] Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that. [the tank fires a cannon, but the giant guinea pig is unaffected by it.] Ohhh!
Sharon
[whispering] Where do we go, Randy?
Randy
We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. [points, and Sharon takes Shelly out the door and to the left. Randy follows them, but something catches his eye: a giant guinea pig is chewing a man's left arm off. The man is trying to get away by holding on to a light post with his right hand.]
Man
Geow, my arm! MY ARM! [the guinea pig pulls him away from the light post and dangles him]
Randy
Oh Jesus!
Sharon
Randy, run! [the man falls to the ground as the rest of his arm is bitten off. Randy runs]
Randy
[the camera is aimed at his feet again] Okay. We're running now. [aims the camera at Sharon and Shelly before him] There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!
Shelly
[glances back] Dad! [Randy moves the camera around to catch another mauling, then aims it back at Sharon and Shelly]
Randy
[Sound of a explosion is heard. Randy points the camera to it and sees a giant guinea pig which starts moving towards him] Ahhh! [Before them is an empty bus with an open door] In there, in there! [Sharon and Shelly go on up the steps and into the bus. Randy follows them in] Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?
Sharon
Randy, put down that c-! [something big crashes into the bus. Randy gets his bearings and he sees a giant guinea pig outside the bus looking in]
Shelly
It's gonna kill us!
Sharon
[soothing her down] Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. [another guinea pig jostles the bus]
Randy
Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. [runs down the aisle and outside]
Sharon
Randy? Where are you going? [Randy stops a moment and then continues, moving away from the bus. He stops and aims his camera at the bus. Two giant guinea pigs climb up to the roof]
Randy
Here we see a view from outside the bus.
Sharon
Randy! [Randy runs back into the bus and towards his girls] What the hell are you doing?
Randy
I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. [another jostle follows and the camera shuts off again]
The Peruvian jungle. The pilots and the boys continue walking. Cpt. Gabriel tries to navigate the jungle using a map of Peru
Cpt. Gabriel
I don't know, Lemsky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps.
Cpt. Taylor
This whole valley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit. [they pass by gianr fruit] Ain't that a peach? And how do you like them apples?
Cpt. Gabriel
Take a look at this! They look like... beehive combs.
Cpt. Taylor
Oh my God.
Stan
Dude, what is this place?
Cpt. Taylor
It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge.
Craig
That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.
Stan
[turns right and walks towards Craig] Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
Kyle
Yeah. Stuff just happens.
Craig
Stuff just happens.
Kyle
That's right!
Craig
You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
Cartman
That's right.
Craig
You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.
Cpt. Taylor
Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving.
Kenny
[suddenly points] (Hey, look out!) [some brown saliva lands on Cpt. Gabriel's right shoulder, then he's chomped up, then Cpt. Taylor is chomped up too. One of Cpt. Gabriel's arms falls back to the ground. Boys start running where they came for]
Cpt. Taylor
Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!
Somewhere in South Park, night. Randy starts his camera up again and begins filming
Randy
All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
Butters
Hello, heh.
Linda
What is that? Chris, what is that?
Randy
That's a that's a, that's a new sound. [the sound of bees gets louder and louder as Randy moves his camera around]
Stephen
Oh God look!
Sharon
Those aren't guinea pigs.
Stephen
Get off the roof! [the group quickly heads for the stairs.]
Randy
Go! Go go go go go! [the group goes down the stairs and Randy closes the roof door behind him.] Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. [they reach Best Buy's main floor. As they go towards the entrance two televisions on the television aisle show a news report]
An Anchorman
And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe.
Randy
Oh no! Oho oho. [they exit the store]
Townsman 1
Get away, there's bees everywhere! [The group runs across the parking lot with everyone else] There's another one right there! [Randy looks to his right with his camera and a giant guinea bee stands there not doing much. Another bee appears in front of him, and to his left, a man is on the ground with a giant stinger stuck into his chest.]
Townsman 2
It stung me! It stung me! [Randy looks behind now, seeing the Best Buy store and a giant guinea bee]
Randy
Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!
The Andes jungle. The boys are left to their own devices, so they continue walking
Kyle
Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
Cartman
Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. [points to his left]
Kenny
(I think we're fucked!)
Kyle
Hey, hey, look at this. [points to his right. The other boys look. A small temple is shown with two statues, one on either side of the entrance. The boys approach it]
Cartman
What is it?
Kyle
I don't know. It's old.
Stan
Let's see what's in there.
Craig
"Let's see what's in there." That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say "Let's see what's in there."
Stan
It might be a way out, Craig!
Cartman
Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! [the boys enter]
Inside the temple. Stan lights the way with the torch
Kyle
Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
Kenny
(Yeah. Totally.)
Stan
You guys, look at this. [the others go to the wall Stan is looking at] It's a wall of ancient drawings. [first drawing is a group of four men playing instruments]
Kyle
Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
Stan
I know, a-and look. [second drawing is the flute band playing music, which is driving away two giant guinea pigs]
Cartman
Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
Kyle
Oh no way! Look! [a flute band is shown behind bars] The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. [the boys look up and to the right]
Stan
And then the guinea pigs killing people. [they look a little lower] And then... [a boy holds a staff against a giant guinea pig]
Cartman
Dude, it's Craig!
Craig
What?
Kyle
That is Craig. [Craig comes forward to look for himself. The other boys back away]
Stan
Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?
Craig
I have no idea.
Cartman
Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
Craig
I don't know.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security, strategic room. Chertoff sits behind the table with his staff and some soldiers looking on
Top Official
There is now word of huge beehives forming in cities across the U.S. and Canada. Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.
Michael Chertoff
And how are the efforts to contain all this going?
Official 3
[steps forward] It's bad, sir. It seems we have no way of stopping it; we've lost complete control. [Chertoff laughs maniacally]
Top Official
Uh, sir?
Michael Chertoff
Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke.
Official 1
Oh, a-hah.
Michael Chertoff
All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu.
Soldier:
Uh, Machu Picchu, sir?
Michael Chertoff
Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?!
Official 1
But S-sir, what could possibly be at Machu Picchu to help the-
Michael Chertoff
Am I in charge or not?! [silences them all]
Inside a supermarket in South Park. Randy prepares his camera again
Randy
We're in the [pants] grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
Sharon
Can we get out through the highway?
Soldier 5
The highway is unreachable; there's guinea rats all over it.
Mr. Garrison
Guinea rats?
Randy
[almost hyperventilating] I'm so startled.
Mr. Garrison
What do you mean "guinea rats"?
Soldier 5
Look, there are guinea pigs, but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats. I've even seen some guinea spiders out there.
Sharon
Randy, will you stop doing that?! [Randy continues to film her, then jumps to the next speaker, then the next one...]
Stephen
Look, I, I think we need to find a way out under the city.
Mr. Garrison
In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
Randy
[walks away with the camera, rather scared] Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?
A Woman
Oh my God!
Townsman 3
Something's inside the store!
Townsman 4
Guinea rabbits! They're inside! [facing him is a guinea pig in a blue rabbit outfit]
Townsman 5
God they're everywhere!
Townsman 6
Help me! [Randy finds out who's screaming for help] Help... me... [it's a man who's practically been bitten in half]
Townswoman 1
Travis! No!
Randy
You can't help him!
Stephen
There's something over there!
Townsman 7
It's a guinea bear!
Randy
No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid! [he lowers the camera as he runs, then raises it again to focus on a woman]
Townswoman 2
Kill me!
Sharon
Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! [he follows the survivors into the storeroom, and the door closes behind them a few seconds later. There is no light in the room]
Shelly
Mom, I can't see.
Randy
It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision. [night vision mode is on] There. There. Okay. Gaaah! [the others gasp]
Sharon
What what what what?
Randy
Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah! [camera out]
Stan is still guiding the others through the Incan temple, and the sound of running water is soon heard
Stan
Let's head over this way, guys.
Kyle
Hear that? It sounds like water.
Cartman
Yeah, it's coming from up there.
Stan
Wow. [they find themselves in a massive complex full of statues whose mouths or noses serve as waterfall fountains. Several suspension bridges connect the mouth of the statue they're in to the other statues]
Cartman
Dude, that's awesome.
Stan
All right, let's go. [Craig doesn't move]
Craig
No.
Stan
Wait, whattaya mean no?
Craig
I'm not following you guys any more.
Stan
Dude, we we have to go check this out.
Craig
Why?
Stan
'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
Craig
Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because "that's just the way it is."
Stan
Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
Craig
I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
Kyle
How do you do that?
Craig
It's easy. Watch. [turns around and walks back out the way they came in. He makes his way back to the temple's entrance, and the boys follow him]
Stan
Craig, dude, wait up.
Cartman
[Craig leads the boys across the Nazca Plateau] Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
Craig
No.
Stan
[Craig leads them across an open field] Hey look, there's something here.
Craig
...Nope.
Cartman
[the boys walk through a thunderstorm] Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
Craig
Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.
South Park. Randy turns his camera on again
Randy
It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say "hey" guys.
Shelly
What is that? What is that? [Sharon holds her close]
Randy
I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! [gets up with his camera and heads outside]
Outside Outback Steakhouse. Randy runs into a fleeing couple
Randy
What is it?
Husband
It's a Guineasaurus Rex! [Randy turns around and sees the G. Rex next to P.F. Chang. It's much bigger than other guinea creatures: about 30 feet high at the shoulder. Everyone near it scatters. Randy zooms in on the car it seems to be eating from and sees a dead couple there. The woman's body is halfway out the car through the windshield. The man's body is halfway out through the passenger door. The alarm has gone off.]
Shelly
Oh my Gohhhd!
Randy
Oh no, I'm way too startled!
Sharon
[points up to the sky] Look! [three jet fighters swoop in from somewhere and fire missiles at the G. Rex, but it remains unscathed]
Randy
Jesus, they can't kill it! [turns his camera to Shelly] What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly? [she's scared, but moves closer to the street to get a better look. This puts her in the same frame as the G. Rex] Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly. [Shelly turns around frozen in fear] Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?
Sharon
Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
Randy
Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. [she rears back and smacks the camera out of his hand]
Machu Picchu, night. Chertoff arrives with his staff at the site in a military helicopter
Michael Chertoff
Wait here a minute. [nearby a huge golden Incan idol holds a stick and a pan flute. Chertoff approaches it and opens his arms] Behold! I am standing on your precious land! I've waited a long time for this! [unzips his pants and urinates on the statue, mocking it with laughter]
Soldier 6
What's he doing?
Michael Chertoff
What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me! [there's some sound to his left and he turns to see what it is. It's Craig climbing over a wall and dusting himself off. Chertoff approaches him in anger] Craiiig! [the other four boys appear behind Craig] No! How did you get here?!
Cartman
Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
Soldier 6
Sir, ih-is everything all right?
Michael Chertoff
Shoot them!
Soldier 7
Shoot them?
Michael Chertoff
They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.
Stan
No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
Michael Chertoff
I said shoot them!
Kyle
Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
Top Official
Maybe we should look at it, sir.
Michael Chertoff
Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!
Craig
I didn't say anything.
Michael Chertoff
[begins his speech] You see, for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the Guinea Valley of Peru. The Incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay: by playing pan flute music. Guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do. But the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and I have made that happen! The Incas predicted the world would be saved... by Craig. But that part of the prophecy will not come true! For you will all die on this mountain! [one of the soldiers fires his rifle and the bullets pierce through Chertoff's chest, leaving a large hole. Chertoff looks at the hole and cackles]
Top Official
You're, you're some kind of monster.
Michael Chertoff
[ominously] Oh, I'm much more than that. Guinea bees, guinea rabbits, guineasaurus rexes, I am something much more evil! [he begins to transform. His mouth becomes a round orifice with a few teeth inside, then into a horrible beast with many teeth in his mouth and a pirate costume on his body, and finally, a giant guinea pirate] Arrrgh.
Top Official
Guinea pirate! [dives into the bushes]
Stan
Jesus Christ!
Craig
Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? [walks onto a square with a pattern on it. The circle in the center of the pattern lights up and begins to rotate up and out. Two stone slabs jut out from the pillar. The golden idol's eyes light up. A beam of light goes from the idol's staff to one of the slabs, and two beams of lightning come out of Craig's eyes and strike the guinea pirate]
Michael Chertoff
Dargh, no!
Craig
Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.
Michael Chertoff:
Argh, curse ye, Craig. Dar, argh. [the guinea pirate falls on its back and the beams turn off. The slabs go back into the pillar and the pillar rotates back into the ground. The four boys approach Craig, stunned at what just happened. Craig lets out a big sigh of relief]
A picture of Craig is shown, and Gery Numan's "Cars" is playing in pan flute format
Craig
My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released, [a shot of that is shown; happy pan flute musicians] and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains. [shots from all over are shown, specifically South Park and New York City: pan flute bands are driving the guinea creatures away] Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed. [shots of the cleanup are shown. The Marshes are among the rescued] All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.
Randy
[trying to show a video clip to two firemen] Here here, look, look! [there's no picture] What the? [opens the camera to check it out] Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. [someone else took a picture of that, though]
Craig
The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days. [the guinea pirate is taken to the Washington D.C. State Penitentiary strapped down to a flatbed truck. Next, a shot of Paris is shown: a Peruvian flute band plays at the Champs Elysées] And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security. [Top Official 1 and Official 3 drop him off and smile at the joyful parents] My parents were sooo happy. [a shot of Craig looking at himself in the mirror, reflecting on the events surrounding his trip to Peru] I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us. [a shot of Craig in bed, just after bedtime] We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. [a shot of the boys dressed as Mariachis standing at Craig's front porch talking to him; he slams the door in their faces.]
Craig's front yard. The boys walk away all pissed off
Cartman
That guy's an asshole!
Kyle
Yeah, what a dick!
Kenny
(I fuckin' hate Craig!)
Department of Homeland Security, days later. A new director has taken over and is seated behind a solid wooden desk
Top Official 2
[enters the office without warning] Sir! Sir, we have a problem!
New Director
What now?!
Top Official 2
The former director of Homeland Security, that turned out to be a guinea pig? It attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell.
New Director
My God, are you telling me..?
Top Official 2
Yes sir. It broke out of prison. [heavy footfalls are felt throughout Washington D.C. Car alarms go off, people scream, and a large guinea pig in striped prison uniform appears. The camera shuts off.]
End of Pandemic 2: The Startling

About Last Night...
Chicago, night. Barack Obama stands behind a podium facing two TelePrompTers, two glass walls, and a crowd of supporters. He has just won the Presidency.
Obama
If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. [a cheer goes up in the audience]
The Marsh house. Randy jumps for joy while his family, including Grandpa Marsh, sits on the sofa behind him. Another couple stands behind the sofa. Gerald and Sheila sit on a second sofa. Randy and Gerald wear Obama shirts
Randy
Yyeeaahh!!!! [pumps his beer can up and down a couple of times] Obama! [runs around] WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
Gerald
[stands up] Yyeeaahh!!!!
Obama
It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.
Randy
Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!
Obama
Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him "Sparkles".
Randy
[kneels before the TV] He's so awesome! [runs his hand over the screen a few times] He's so perfect and awesome!
Obama
Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can.
Supporters
[in Chicago] Yes we can!
Randy
Yes I can! Yes I can! [the others watch him run out of the house]
Outside the Marsh house. Randy opens the door and proclaims
Randy
Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! [people nearby gather around the front steps]
Mr. Harris
Did you see? Our man is in! [among the gathering crowd are Mr. Adler and the Blacks.]
Mrs. Harris
We did it!
Mr. Adler
Everything is going to be awesome now!
Randy
This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
Linda Black
I don't even know what to do now.
Randy
I know what to do! [steps into the street and cups his hands on his cheeks so as to amplify his voice] Losers! Looosers!
The Stotch house, living room. A "Go McCain" banner hangs over the sofa. Mr. Garrison sits on a chair, Stephen and Linda sit on the sofa with Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria and her boyfriend sit on two chairs in front of Mr. Mackey. Most everyone there is wearing a McCain/Palin shirt or sweater
Crowd
[outside] Looosers! Looosers!
Stephen
Oh, shut up!
Crowd
Looosers!
Butters
We lost?
McCain
[giving his concession speech] It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.
Supporters
No no! Noo nooo!
Butters
Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
Stephen
[gets up and walks to the TV] No. No, this can't happen! No! [kicks the TV screen, causing it to short and shatter]
Linda
Stephen!
Stephen
It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead.
Linda
You don't know that, Stephen!
Mr. Mackey
With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!
Mr. Garrison
We'll probably be dead by sunrise!
Stephen
Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... [someone pounds on the door. Stephen and Butters look over and the door opens. It's Randy]
Randy
WOOOO Obama!
Mr. Garrison
Get out o'here!
The Marsh house. It's quiet there now. The doorbell rings and Stan answers it. He sees Kyle and Ike on the landing
Kyle
Dude, have you seen my parents? [Ike begins to cry]
Stan
No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
Kyle
He was a McCain supporter. [Ike cries harder] It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
Chicago, Obama headquarters. It's 1:10 am and Obama steps through some double doors. The press awaits him.
Reporter 1
Uh Mr. President, over here!
Reporter 2
Congratulations!
Reporter 3
Great start, great job!
Reporter 4
Change!
Reporter 5
Great job, Mr. President!
Reporter 6
Great job, Obama!
Obama
Thank you all for your support. If you don't mind, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening getting some much needed rest. [steps through double doors at the other end of the hall and closes them behind him. A man walks out of the shadows as Obama turns away from the doors] Senator McCain.
McCain
President Obama. [the two men step up and face each other, then start to giggle, then roar with laughter. They give each other a high-five and a low-five.]
McCain, Obama
Boom, baby!
Obama
Ohoh man that was perfect! [works on removing his jacket]
McCain
[pulls out a cell phone and starts calling someone] I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us.
Obama
You played it perfectly, there was no way.
McCain
It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President.
Davis
Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that?
McCain
Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours.
Davis
Sure. Hard part's over, right?
McCain
Actually, the hard part's just starting.
The streets of South Park. Two men set up a "Obama for President 2008" banner over the roof of a house. Down below are posters and banners for Obama plastered all over the houses and the crowd is partying to "Celebration". Randy rallies them on by blowing through a paper horn
Reveler 1
[gulps down a beer] Yoohoo!
Reveler 2
Obama yeah, I can't believe it!
Randy
O ba ma! O ba ma!
Revelers
O ba ma! O ba ma!
Randy
Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on! [reaches a keg of beer and serves himself some into a mug] It's Obamobama! [someone walks by and just throws up]
Stan's house. He and Kyle look at the partying going on outside. Stan is on the phone
Stan
Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. [outside the music changes to "Who Let The Dogs Out?" Someone swings from a traffic light and falls. A truck full of young adults rolls by]
Crowd
Obama!
Randy
Who let the Obama out? [moments later a police car rolls down the street, slowly going through the crowd] Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!
Crowd
OooooOOOOooo! [Officer Barbrady stops the cruiser and hops out of it]
Barbrady
Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!
Randy
BOOOO! [other people join in the booing]
Reveler
...party Obama!
Barbrady
Come on, time to go home.
Randy
What are you? A McCain voter?
Crowd
Yeah!
Randy
Sorry pal, but Obama's President now! [walks towards Barbrady, and his pants begin to fall to his ankles] Obama! Obama! [walks past him and towards the police car]
Crowd
Obama! Obama!
Randy
Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! [other revelers walk up and help out]
Barbrady
Ey, put down my car! [Randy and the revelers succeed in flipping the car over]
Revelers
Yes we can! [they move in and keep rocking the car as the music switches to "Mickey".]
Barbrady
No! No! Hey, stop it!
Stan
Jesus Christ...
Randy
O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! [Cartman rolls by in his Big Wheels trike, pulling a cart full of TVs]
Cartman
Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]
Washington D.C., at the penthouse of a hotel. Obama and McCain enter a suite where the rest of their team is waiting for them. It's 2:15 am. The team members applaud them as they reach the middle of the room.
Quincy
Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off!
McCain
Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever.
Neely
I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle.
Obama
Always workin' the angles.
McCain
My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history.
Quincy
So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time? [Obama and McCain look at each other knowingly. The next scene shows a huge diamond necklace]
Obama
The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars.
Davis
Two hundred ten?
McCain
Million.
Quincy
No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that.
Obama
Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built. [Two security guards go around closing the exhibits for the night] The Diamond Wing Is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel. On the northeast side, a seven-five laser system. [the guards walk out of a room and turn on the laser system as they exit] There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached.
Davis
So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top.
Obama
Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.
Quincy
Okay, you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above, so you can't get the diamond. [Obama walks over to the computer and turns it on, stepping aside for McCain]
McCain
Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel, [a simulation begins to play on the computer monitors] A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.
Neely, Davis
Boom, baby!
McCain
You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on.
Quincy
So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel.
McCain
And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.
Quincy
This all sounds very risky.
Obama
[walks across the floor] We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-
Neely
And we are.
Obama
[turns around] -we won't get caught.
Stan's house, night. Kyle is in the kitchen, on the phone with 9-1-1.
Kyle
Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
Stan
[walks in from the dining room] Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.
Kyle
What?!
Stan
Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
Kyle
Oh my God! [drops the phone and follows Stan to Ike]
Stan's house, one of the windows. Kyle is standing on a window sill in the den mumbling out loud. Stan and Kyle run outside and reach the window
Kyle
Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for! [Ike begins to cry] I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay. [Ike mumbles something to him] No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan. [Ike says something more] Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something. [The camera zooms out to show that the window is barely off the ground. Ike cries, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
Ike
Good-bye. [falls from the window sill and lands on the ground face down]
Stan, Kyle
NOO!
Kyle
Ike? [no response] Oh crap Ike?
The White House, night
Chief of Security
All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3.
SS Agent
Sir! S-sir, we have a bit of a problem.
Chief of Security
What?
SS Agent
The new President-elect is here. Eh he wants into the Oval Office.
Chief of Security
Barack Obama? [next scene shows Barack Obama walking through the White House]
SS Agent 2
They're all, they're all right through here, sir.
Chief of Security
[interrupting as Obama enters] Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama?
Obama
Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?
Chief of Security
Good, sir.
Obama
I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?
Chief of Security
Right now?
Obama
I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff.
Chief of Security
[backs up towards the Oval Office] Sure, right this way, Mr... President. [opens the doors to the office]
Obama
[enters the office] I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?
Chief of Security
Yes sir. [Obama places a bill into the Chief's jacket breast pocket]
Obama
Thanks. [closes the doors]
Chief of Security
I got a hundred dollars. [grins]
Inside the Oval Office.
Obama
All right, McCain. I'm in.
McCain
Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian. [he's with a construction team] You find the escape tunnel?
Obama
I'm already on it. [plugs a hacking device into an electronic lock hidden under a panel on the desktop; it quickly starts crunching numbers in trying to decode the password. Once it decodes the right password the desk moves to one side and the secret passage is revealed] Boom baby.
South Park, early early morning. The Obama supporters are still partying on the neighborhood streets. The music this time is "Whoomp! (There it is)"
Reveler 3
Yehhheheah!
Randy
[even more drunk than before, serves himself more beer] Wooo, change.
Reveler 4
Change.
Reveler 5
Change.
Stan
[running up to him with Kyle] Dad Dad, we have a problem.
Randy
Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
Stan
No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
Randy
We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
Stan
Dude, he's wasted.
Randy
Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! [walks over]
Randy's Boss
Oh, hello Marsh.
Randy
Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! [Stan and Kyle are stunned]
Randy's Boss
Huh?
Randy
You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
Stan
[quite concerned] Dad, what are you doing?!
Randy
It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit [gives him the finger again] You know what Obama said? Yes we can!
Randy's Boss
Hey, I voted for Obama.
Randy
Obama's not talkin' about you!
Kyle
[looks around] Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. [Randy punches his boss in the face and his boss just leaves, holding his hands over his nose]
McCain headquarters. Sarah Palin stands behind a podium. Photographers snap away at their cameras
Palin
I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009. [the cameras die down and everyone is a bit aghast at her statement]
Reporter 1
Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain?
Palin
Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but [her cell phone begins to ring] Oh, my phone's going ringy. Ex-cuse me. [steps away from the podium and off the stage to her left. She answers the phone at a safe distance from the stage] Hello?
McCain
Hello Sarah, it's McCain.
Palin
[switches to a British accent] I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges.
Obama
I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum.
Palin
Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.
Obama
God she's awesome.
Palin
[returns to the podium and a normal voice] Oh, I guess Senator McCain's gonna fly me back to Alaska now. He's got a private jet, you know? Okay, byebye then. [walks off to her right] Bloody idiots. [she walks out of the headquarters through a side door, tosses off her red business suit and walks towards the camera in a catsuit. She whips out some sais and spins them around like pistols]
McCain
All right, here we go. [a piledriver is turned on and a massive pile is lifted up, then dropped. Shockwaves spread out each time the pile hits the ground]
Guard 1
What's that noise?
Guard 2
It's okay, just some construction outside. [Obama prepares a charge and sets it off, and light enters the tunnel. Obama has broken into the Smithsonian. He pops his head through the hole]
Inside the Smithsonian. Obama looks around and sees the laser system is on.
Oh no. [presses a button on his headset] McCain? We've got a problem. [the lasers are now blue instead of red]
[South Park streets, night. Stan and Kyle have placed Ike in a red Radio Flier wagon and are pulling him along. Ike moans from time to time. They pass by a gas station]
Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
[points ahead] Hey, there's some people. [ahead of them is a garage that has been converted into a cave. Stephen Stotch and the other McCain supporters are there putting stuff away. Stephen is holding a crowd of other McCain supporters at bay with a rifle.]
Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. [above the garage door is the work "A.RK"]
You have to let us in! You know the country's doomed!
Who are you to turn us away?!
I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!
Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!
You're going to deny them too?
[throws down his sleeping bag] For God's sake, man, they're children! [kneels next to Stan] Look them in the eyes and tell them you won't take them in! [tugs on Stan's cheeks] Look at their little cheeks!
Let go of my face, asshole!
All right, damn you! The children can come in!
No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
Okay, then I want their place.
Me too.
We NEED a ride to the hospital!
THERE ISN'T GONNA BE A HOSPITAL! DON'T YOU GET IT?!
Let us in now! [Stephen smacks her away, and a brawl follows]
Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!
Obama hasn't been elected four hours and already the country's going to hell! [another supporter smacks him down from behind. Stan and Kyle just leave and resume their walk]
[The Oval Office, outside. The Chief of Security knocks on the door]
Mr. Obama? [tries to open it, but can't] Sir? [looks to another Secret Service agent] All right, give me the keys. [the door opens before the agent could reach for the keys. Barack Obama dusts himself off]
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there?
Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone?
Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here.
My wife?
[appears behind the agents] Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?
[pulls her into the Oval Office] Uh, c-c-come on in, darling. [appears at the doorway again] Thank, thank you boys. [closes and locks the doors]
[The Oval Office, inside. Barack and Michelle are alone now]
Okay Barack, tell me what's going on?
Michelle, there's something I need to tell you.
What is it? [Obama stays quiet] Barack, what is it?!
The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago.
You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?
[wearing a huge fake mustache] Hi, Michelle.
[removes the Bluetooth device from Obama's right ear and places it on her own] You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?!
Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay.
On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system!
Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replace the laser system, but the new one isn't brand-new. It's an old H-7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes.
Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark.
Did you catch that, Davis?
I'm on it.
[Hell's Pass Hospital, night. Stan and Kyle finally make it to the emergency entrance]
We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. [they enter the ER and see a lot of patients in there. One man has an Obama flag stuck up his ass. The clock reads 9 p.m., so it must be broken]
[showing an Obama patient where to wait] There, just take a seat over there.
[getting the nurse's attention] E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?
Why does that matter?
Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. [on one side of the ER are Obama supporters who are suffering the effects of too much partying, and on the other are McCain supporters who have more serious wounds]
Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere.
So where's the other doctor? [the nurse opens a door behind her and the other doctor... is hanging from a noose attached to the ceiling]
[walking in suddenly towards the Obama side] Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking. [moans come up from all over the ER as people cover their ears] And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. [a McCain supporter tries to hasten his death by smashing a corkscrew into his head]
[The Smithsonian. Michelle and Obama are at the tunnel's new entry point near the Hope Diamond. Michelle is still breaking the new laser system]
I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand?
Did you really not like pretending to be married?
Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B.
Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.
My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it.
[to everyone connected to his bluetooth unit] All right, everyone. We're about to go. So here's the revised schedule: 4:40 a.m., the team gathers at the northwest exit of the museum. [the heist is shown taking place as Obama goes through the schedule] 4:45 a.m., Michelle hacks the optical relay, allowing me access to the rear doors.
Go! [Obama takes off]
4:46, from inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew. [Obama opens the vault door and McCain and the others walk in] 5:10 a.m., at the Department of Power Quincy shuts down the grid, disabling power to the vault room. 5:12, my grandmother who faked her death on Monday calls in a bomb threat to the museum.
I said I put a bomb in your building, bitch.
5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs. [above them, Palin crawls across the ceiling like Spider-Man towards the entrance] 5:14, McCain, dressed as a football player, enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm. [Palin drops down and hangs upside down. She lifts the glass display cover from the diamond and swipes the Hope Diamond from its display case. McCain is spotted and flees]
Hey you! Stop!
Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched. [Davis and Neely act as repairmen and seal up the hole] 5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus.
[to the Secret Service] All done. Thanks. [Barack and Michelle head outside, towards a limousine. The door opens and McCain is waiting for them. They enter and take their seats, and the limousine rolls off. The rest of the team looks at the three of them, and they all laugh. Obama takes the diamond out of his ass and displays it for all to see.]
Boom, baby!
There's just one thing: don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you?
We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago. [a plane sits all by itself in a field somewhere. The interior is full of dummies. Nearby, in a recovery room, Ike rises from his bed as Stan and Kyle look off into space. He presses a button and the plane blows up: the plane was landed near Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan and Kyle hear the explosion and quickly turn around and look outside]
What the hell? [they observe the burning plane. Ike sneaks away while the boys are distracted. He dashes across the hall to the coroner's office and enters it. He hops onto a chair and attaches a USB stick to a computer, and begins typing. Dossiers of the heist team members pop up and Ike classifies each one as deceased. The door opens, and Kyle and Stan enter] Ike?
Boom, baby.
[Washington D.C., day. The heist team members are in the waiting room watching their plane, an Air Tahiti jet, taxi into position]
Here are all the tickets for your group, Mr. Sanchez.
Thank you very much.
Well friends, let us depart.
Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye.
Wha?
I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot.
B, you can't be serious.
Besides, you died in a jet in the Rocky Mountains, remember?
Could have been I didn't make that flight. [walks up to Michelle] What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while.
You're serious.
Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?
Aww, what the fuck. [they begin to kiss, and the other members of the team wave goodbye and head for the plane]
I just looove happy endings.
[South Park, the A.RK, morning. The garage door goes up and the McCain supporters in the bunker look out into the same scene they'd seen countless times before.]
It's still here, ih... it's all still here.
Does that mean... maybe we overreacted?
No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.
[The Marsh house, living room. Randy wakes up from a drunken slumber, trash still strewn all over the living room.]
Uhh... [sits up and tries to rub his eyes, but he's got a headache] Oh ow. [walks forward...] Hey, where are my pants? [looks at the table the TV is missing from] Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!
Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
[surprised] Oh! [is pissed off again] Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! [kicks a side table away and walks off]
End of About Last Night...

Elementary School Musical
South Park Elementary School Cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are in the center table once again, with the girls off to screen right. This time there are ten boys present, five on each side.

Red
I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody.

Girls' Table
As long as we stick together, together we'll stay.
And every kid in school is special in their own way.

Bridon Gueermo
I like havin' fun in the hot summer sun (wooo!)
An' groovin' to the beat when my homework is all done. (yeah!)
If you ask me what I know, then you know what I will say?
That every single body is special in their own way.

Stan

Butters
Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.

Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
Stan
Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
Stan's house. The boys are watching High School Musical. They're watching a musical sequence with all singing and dancing on tables and up and down stairs. It's quite an elaborate presentation
Singers
You've gotta go with the status quo. If you wanna be a regular Joe. (come on now)
And your dreams are only a beat away; don't let 'em tell you no. (tell you no-o-o)
You've gotta go with the status quo. Keep singing 'bout the status quo (keep singing 'bout the status)
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status quo (go with the status quo). That's where we should go. (Go there now)
Copies of pop songs packaged by Disney and turned into a show (into a show).
That's the status quo! That's the status quo (That's the status quo) That's the status quohh!

That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status-

During this number, the following conversation takes place. At first the boys are silently watching the TV, then
Cartman
This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. [silence follows for a few seconds, then Stan holds up the DVD case]
Stan
Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
Kyle
They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
Cartman
Well, I'm out guys. [get up from the sofa, puts on his jacket, and heads for the front door] If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
Stan
I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
Kyle
I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
Kenny
(No way in hell I'm doing it.)
Stan
All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. [holds up his right hand. Kyle holds his right hand up as well, and Kenny holds up his left]
Kyle
I swear
Kenny
(I swear too.)
Stan
Okay, good.
South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. Kids begin taking their seats. Stan is writing something as Cartman come in and sits down
Cartman
Ehhhhhhh. [Stan stops writing]
Kyle
What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
Cartman
I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
Stan
But you didn't die?
Cartman
...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. [The bell rings and Mr. Garrison walks in with his books]
Mr. Garrison
All right, kids in seats, kids in seats. [the last few kids take their seats] Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall. [He writes "Berlin Wall" on the chalkboard] This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.
Wendy
stands up on the seat of her desk] East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. [some kids begin to snap their fingers

Bebe
As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.

Kyle
Aw man.
Class
Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat

Mr. Garrison
[beaming] Oh, you kids. [Stan buries his face in his hand]</i></poem>
Class
Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.

Bridon
[enters the classroom] East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.

Wendy
We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair.

[Stan looks at them both and begins to worry that Bridon might sweep her away]
Bridon, Wendy
Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.

Class
East siiide, west siiide, east siiide...

Cartman:
[looking around and getting pissed off] God this sucks!
The hallway, later on. Wendy's at her locker putting some books away. Stan is far enough away that she doesn't notice him, but he's watching her. Jimmy walks up to him
Jimmy
Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?
Stan
I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
Jimmy
M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel.
Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-

Stan
Stop. [holds his left hand out, palm out, for emphasis, and walks away. Jimmy stops singing]
Jimmy
All righty then.
Stan
[walks up to Wendy] Uh, Wendy?
Wendy
[looks at him] Hey Stan.
Stan
Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
Wendy
What?
Stan
I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
Wendy
Stan, that's ridiculous.
Stan
It is?
Wendy
I would never leave you for Bridon.
Stan
[brightens up] Really?
Wendy
No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. [shuts her locker and walks away, kissing Stan on the left cheek. Jimmy arrives two second later]
Jimmy
There you go. Feel better, p-pal? [Stan stays quiet]
Stan walks through some double doors and continues down the hallway. The doors close behind him
Stan
What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away. [at an intersection he takes a left turn] I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him. [kids appear behind him and follow him] But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse? [noticing the finger-snapping, he stops walking and looks around. The kids wait for him to start singing and dancing] No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
Kids
Awww. [murmurs follow]
Stan
No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.
Kids
Awww. [more murmuring. As they disperse, Butters walks up to Stan]
Butters
Awww jeez, you're no fun. [turns right and walks away. At the other end of the hall, Bridon rounds a corner and dances down the hallway in Stan's direction]
Bebe
Hey Bridon.
Bridon
Hey.
Lola
Hi Bridon
Bridon
Hi.
Heidi, Millie
Hey Bridon.
Bridon
Hey.
Stan
[now hiding behind a corner. Bridon passes by him unaware] Hey, kid, over here. [Bridon looks around and finds Stan, then walks over to him] Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
Bridon
Huh?
Stan
Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
Bridon
They are?
Stan
Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me, [gets stern] you're driving everyone crazy.
Bridon
I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.
Stan
You don't like doing it?
Bridon
It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.
Stan
Basketball?
Bridon
I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
Stan
Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
Bridon
I can't.
Stan
[firmly] Yes, you can. What's stopping you?
Bridon
[sighs deeply] It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.
Stan
No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
Bridon
Really?
Stan
When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
Bridon
You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. [walks away]
Stan
[proud of himself] Sweet.
Bridon's house, night. He's seated at table for dinner. His mom enters the dining room with the main dish, a casserole. The dining room is lined with posters from various musicals - Phantom of the Opera, Mamma Mia... Felines. A full-length mirror is also present
Mrs. Gueermo
Sit up properly, Bridon. You know how strict your father is about posture. [serves out the casserole] All right dear, dinner's ready!
Mr. Gueermo
[struts in, checks himself out in the mirror, and takes his seat at the head of the table] Okay, let's eat!
Bridon
Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.
Mr. Gueermo:
Ooo, that sounds emotional! [holds his hand against his ear to listen better]
What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time.

Bridon
No, Dad, can we just talk?
Mr. Gueermo
If you can talk it, you can sing it. [gets up and dances to the mirror again] You can lay down the rhythm and bring it! Just put a melody to the words that you're sayin' and sing the beat-

Bridon
Dad, I want to join the basketball team. [his Dad is upset. He turns around and faces Bridon]
Mr. Gueermo
What did you say?
Bridon
This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.
Mr. Gueermo
Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
Bridon
But Dad, it's what I really want.
Mr. Gueermo
There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
Bridon
I know. That's kind of why I like it.
Mr. Gueermo
Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club.
Bridon
It's my life, Dad!
Mr. Gueermo
Don't make me slap you! [raises his right hand up, ready to slap] I will slap your face so super hard... [Bridon quickly leaves the table and his dad sits back down] I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!
Mrs. Gueermo
Maybe you should let him try it.
Mr. Gueermo
What did you say, woman?!
Mrs. Gueermo
You aren't being fair.
Mr. Gueermo
That's it! I'm gonna slap you!
Mrs. Gueermo
No, please.
Mr. Gueermo
[begins to sing and slap]
I slap you!

Mrs. Gueermo
Ahh!
Mr. Gueermo
I slap you!

Mrs. Gueermo
Ohh!
Mr. Gueermo
I slap slap slap you!

Mrs. Gueermo
Dohh!
Mr. Gueermo
Slapping you slapping you silly 'cause you disrespected me.

Mrs. Gueermo
Ooohohoo.
South Park Elementary. The four boys approach the school
Cartman
You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
Kyle
You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
Cartman
Fuck you, Kyle! [upon entering the building, they are met by a pre-class musical production]
Kids
And you know, we're together at school again.

Jimmy
School again.

Stan
Aww!
Kids
With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.

Cartman
Oh God, shut up!
Kids
Together at school again. What a special day.

Cartman
Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
Kids
We could say that neverrrrrrrrrrr
Goes away.

The school bell rings and everyone goes to class. Stan catches up to Bridon
Stan
Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
Bridon
Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.
Stan
Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself! [sees someone down the hall] Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett. [Mr. Garrett, the school coach, is eating an apple] This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
Mr. Garrett
Really?
Bridon
[looks down and away] Look, I should be getting to class.
Mr. Garrett
Hey, we sure could use you, kid. I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball. All the kids and the school funding go to the theater department.
Stan
You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
Bridon
I don't know...
Mr. Garrett
Look, just come in at recess and shoot some ball with the team.
Stan
Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
Bridon
Okay.
Recess. The basketball team is assembled in the school gym. Bridon is at the free-throw line and shoots
Mr. Garrett
Aayy, that's great, Bridon.
Bridon
Thanks.
Jason
We might have a chance at winning now. [the doors open at the far end of the gym and Mr. Gueermo enters]
Mr. Gueermo
Bridon!
What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Bupow! Bupow! Bupow!

Bridon
Dad, I was just messin' around.
Mr. Gueermo
I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
Mr. Garrett
Eh, your kid is really good at this.
Mr. Gueermo
Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole! [Bridon puts his ams up in self-defense]
Mr. Garrett
Just... go easy on him, huh?
Mr. Gueermo
[gasps, then raises his right hand up to strike] You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!
Mr. Garrett
If he wants to play ball, you should let him.
Mr. Gueermo
I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!
Mr. Garrett
He's just a kid.
Mr. Gueermo
[slap] You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again. [slap]
Bridon
Dad, stop!
Mr. Gueermo
You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself [slaps with his left hand this time] There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you- [right-hand slap] Slap it, I'll slap it! [left-hand slap. He then pulls Bridon out of the gym.]
Bridon
Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me.
Mr. Gueermo
Shut up, Bridon! [as he reaches the doors, they open and Mr. Mackey appears]
Mr. Mackey
Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?
Mr. Gueermo
Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?! [Mackey doesn't reply, but he slaps him anyway] I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to! [exits the gym, but returns to slap Mackey again, then leaves again]
In the hallway, father and son hurry along.
Mr. Gueermo
You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?! [Stan watches them walk by, his plan dashed] You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!
Bridon
You're hurting my arm.
Mr. Gueermo
Stupid-ass boy!
Stan
[sighs deeply] Ah, shit.
Kyle's house. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny are playing a video game.
Cartman
Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle. [Stan walks into the living room and stands to one side of the sofa] Yeah, nice.
Stan
You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
Kyle
What? Are you crazy?
Cartman
No way dude.
Kyle
We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Stan
I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
Scott Malkinson
What's so bad about hanging out with me?
Cartman
Shut up, Scott Malkinson. "I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes."
Scott
Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!
Cartman
"Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson." [Kenny laughs]
Stan
You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
Kyle
Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Stan
That isn't true! [no one challenges] Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
Scott
Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
Cartman
"That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes."
The Gueermo house, living room, night. Bridon looks out the window as his father dances to High School Musical on screen
Mr. Gueermo
Yadada yadada yadada dadadadada High School Musical is so awesome. [the doorbell rings and Mr. Gueermo pauses the video and prances to the door. He opens it and two adults appear]
Male CPS Agent
Mister... Gueermo?
Mr. Gueermo
[barks] What?
Male CPS Agent
[shows his official badge] We're from Child Protective Services. [puts it away] There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child?
Mr. Gueermo
What? Who the hell's been saying that?!
Female CPS Agent
We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.
Male CPS Agent
His name is Stan Marsh.
Mr. Gueermo
You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world o'hurt about to come your way!
Male CPS Agent
Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son.
Mr. Gueermo
[performs a sweeping gesture to usher them in] Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it! [the agents enter and walk over to Bridon]
Male CPS Agent
Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly. [Mr. Gueermo sneaks up behind him, ready to slap him at any moment] We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes if that's okay and just maybe... [Mr. Gueermo whistles, Mr. Kelly turns around, and Mr. Gueermo slaps him]
Mr. Gueermo
Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?! [slap] No, there's another one!
Female CPS Agent
Oh my God!
Mr. Gueermo
[moves over to the female agent] Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you! [slaps her] There's a slap for you! [three slaps follow] Slap, slap, slap! [slaps Mr. Kelly three more times] Yeah, there you go! [slaps the female agent again] Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap! [slaps the female agent, then slaps Mr. Kelly. Mrs. Gueermo rushes in to intervene and take the slaps]
Mrs. Gueermo
Oh God, please, you have to get away! He won't ever stop! [he slaps her seven times]
Mr. Gueermo
Awww. I'm going slap-happy! [chases after the agents and slaps them several more times before they finally reach their car]
I'm going slap, slap happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house!

[the agents pull away quickly. He notices his next door neighbor looking on from his own doorway] What are you looking at, Robertson? [in a flash he slaps Robertson three times, and just as quickly he's back inside his house and closes the front door.]
South Park Elementary, next day, hallway. Bebe has something to say.
Bebe
They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! [the kids react and gather round the results sheet on the bulletin board. Butters is on a stool checking out the results for everyone]
Butters
Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. [the girls congratulate her and Wendy says something in reply]
Clyde
Who's the male lead?
Butters
No surprise there. It's Bridon. [the boys and a few girls congratulate Bridon, who stays quiet] I get to be a stand-in! [moments later Wendy catches up to Bridon. Stan looks on from a distance]
Wendy
Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.
Bridon
[not enthused] Yeah, great.
Stan
God damn it! [walks away. Next scene is him walking down the hall] No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop. [some kids look at him and decide to follow] And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me. [the kids begin to snap their fingers] They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now? [he stops, the kids stop walking but continue snapping their fingers. Soon they smile in anticipation...]
Sooooomeooooone's in the kitchen with Dinah,
[the kids' anticipation fades. Stan isn't singing as they'd hope he would]
Someone's in the kitchen, I know.
Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
Strummin' on the old banjo and go and
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-o.
[Wendy, Bebe, and some other kids arrive]
Fee, fie, fiddle-e-i-o.
Strumming on the old banjo jo jo...
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
Go tell Aunt Rhodie
The old gray goose is...
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to...
[no one is making a sound. Stan puts his hands in his pockets, hangs his head, then turns left and walks away]

The Gueermo house, night. Mr. Gueermo is getting ready for bed... in an unusual way.
Mr. Gueermo
You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-

Mrs. Gueermo
[enters in a panic] Oh please. You have to do something.
Mr. Gueermo
What are you interrupting me for?!
Mrs. Gueermo
It's our son, he's- he's running away.
Mr. Gueermo
What?! [rushes downstairs and stops with flair behind Bridon, who's steps away from the front door]
What's going on here, what's this all about?

[brings his arms up and out, pointing to Bridon at the end with his left hand]
What do you think you're doing?

Bridon
Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-
Mr. Gueermo
Nono! Sing it!
Bridon
[throws his duffle bag down] No! I'm sick of singing!
Mr. Gueermo
Can you believe it? What'd he just say? What's the matter with kids these days?

[fixes his gaze on his wife, who's terrified for a bit.]
Mrs. Gueermo
[slowly, carefully]
Kids these days.

Mr. Gueermo
Kids these days!

[Bridon ignores him and opens the door. His father flies through the air and slams the door shut with his body]
Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!

Bridon
Just let me go.
Mr. Gueermo
Go ahead. Make my day. [gets down on his left knee and threatens] You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red hand prints all over face! [Bridon punches him on the nose] Ow! [covers his nose and stands up] Oh my God, what was that? [runs to his wife] Did you see that?! Oh my God it hurts so bad! [she punches him harder] Ow. What the "H" is going on?! [she punches him again, and he runs off, crying. Bridon looks on in awe] What are you doing?! Everyone's crazy!
Stan's house, same night. He's on the sofa immersing himself in the High School Musical movies. Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Scott enter.
Kyle
Well, I had to see it to believe it!
Cartman
I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
Stan
Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
Kyle
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
Kenny
(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)
Stan
Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
Kyle
You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
Stan
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
Scott
'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-
Cartman
You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
Stan
Look, guys. [gets off the sofa and walks away from the other boys] The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school. [turns around to face them] And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now, [points to them] everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
Cartman
That's a low blow, Stan.
South Park Elementary, day, the school gym. A basketball game is in progress, five on five. Mr. Mackey and Mr. Adler are doing play-by-play. "Rock & Roll Part II" plays from the speakers
Mr. Mackey
Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows.
Mr. Garrett
All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?
Bridon
[approaches wearing #11] I'm ready, coach.
Mr. Garrett
Give 'em hell! [Bridon goes in and faces off against the Bobcats' #9. He tosses the ball over to #7, Bradley, and then notices his parents on the bleachers. His mom waves hi, his dad looks away displeased.]
Mr. Mackey
Just a minute to go in the first quarter. [Bridon gets the ball back and shots from the top of the key for a 3 pointer. Everyone applauds him, but his father still isn't looking at him. Mr. Gueermo does, however, notice the crowd's excitement and soon gets into it himself. The song changes to "We Will Rock You" and the crowd gets into that with two stomps and a clap. Mr. Gueermo joins right in]
South Park, next day. The kids are milling around the entrance, so classes haven't started yet.
Bebe
Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?
Bridon
I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.
Wendy
You gave it up?
Stan
[walks into view with the other three boys] That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. [music begins to play]

'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. [walks up to a boy and girl]
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. [walks back to Bridon]
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball

Cartman
[approaches two other kids]
But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.

Stan
Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
[the four boys form a chorus line and dance]

Boys
You've gotta do what you wanna do. Even if other people don't really want you to.
[Kyle whips off his hat while approaching two girls]
True, girl, you know it's true, [returns to the chorus line] that the thing you wanna do is the thing that you should do.
[Kyle dances away to two other girls]

Kyle
Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. [Cartman dances over to two kids]

Cartman
And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- [rejoins the chorus line with Kyle]

Boys:
Do what you wanna do.
Just make sure that what you're doing is what's cool and popular with everyone
Chew, baby, chew and chew.
When you're eating jerky, if eating jerky is what you wanna do.

Bebe
[arrives with Wendy, Red, and another girl during the song] Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?
Bridon
Uhh, sure. [the girls follow him to the gym. The other students go their separate ways.]
Kyle
Do what you want, don't have restraint.

Cartman
Don't stress about it or you just might faint.

Kenny
(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)

Stan
Try to do what you wanna do!

Boys
Do what you wanna do.
As long as what you wanna do is what everybody wants you to.
Glue, baby, buy some glue
Just in case if what you're doin' [Stan continues singing, they all keep dancing]

Stan
involves needing scissors and glue!

Scott
Hey guys. Hey guys! [all stop. Stan looks around and doesn't see anyone else]
Stan
Huh? [the other boys turn around]
Kyle
Where did everybody go?
Scott
The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
Stan
But the girls like singing and dancing.
Scott
No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.
Stan
But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.

Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? [looks like all the other kids are playing the same game]
Stan
No, I'm on the Japanese side.
Cartman
Oh, who just shot me? [Bebe leans back in her chair, looks at Cartman, and gives him the finger]
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right... [his voice trails off] uhhh, but then what the hell is the...? [closes the book and goes back to normal voice] Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.
Cartman
Oh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
Butters
[runs into the lab and hides behind the wall] Oh my God, oh my God! [runs up to Stan] Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
Stan
Dude, what?
Butters
There's vampires in the school!
Stan
What?
Butters
Vampires. I've seen 'em.
Stan
Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
Red
Not a cheat if you rank up.
Butters
Ugh. [goes over to Kenny] Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. Then Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
Kyle
Butters, there's no such thing as vampires.
Butters
[goes over to Kyle] But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
Cartman
All right Butters, well you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
Butters
Really? Do you think that's best?
Cartman
Yeah, now get out of here.
Butters
All right! [runs to the entrance, then turns around] If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. [turns back and runs out]
Cartman
Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
The school gym, day. Six kids sit on the bleachers in the otherwise empty building - four boys, two girls. They look somewhat like the Goth kids.
Lead Vampire
Isn't this cool? This time of day nobody's in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts.
Spiky Vampire
That's an awesome new coat, Mike. Looks totally badass.
Vampir
Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.
Spiky Vampire
Oh, that's cool.
Midnight Vampire
[wears a coat showing arm bones] I'm gonna change my name to Vladimir.
Vampir
You can't, it's too close to Vampir. [Butters rises up from one end of the bleachers just enough to see the vampire kids]
Butters
[pulls out a tiny tape recorder and starts dictating into it] 12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
Sparkly Vampire
You know that girl Bella in Twilight? I think I'm like her. I'm a psi vampire. Do you like these sparkles I got?
Butters
[into his recorder] Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.
Vampir
Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire, in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.
Spiky Vampire
Heh, yeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.
Butters
That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
Bloodrayne
Lunchtime's almost over. Should we drink some more blood?
Other Vampires
Yeah! Cool!
Vampir
Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se. [opens a bottle of Clamato and pours some into the Bloodrayne's goblet.]
Butters
Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're- [clock] uhn... [he's run out of tape. It rewinds to the very beginning and plays back]
Tape
[Butters' voice] Toot toododoo! [Butters frantically presses buttons trying to stop the tape] It's the Big Texas Butters show! And now here he is, Big Texas Butters! Why howdy there, partners. I'm Biiig Texas Butters. And this is my horse, Toast. Happy Trails, to youuu! [he turns off the tape record, relieved. Until he looks around and jumps from being startled] AAHHH!
Vampir
Ummm, what are you doing?
Butters
[jumps away and whips out a golden cross] Get back! You stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you! [runs away without his tape recorder] Hwaaaahh!
The school hallway, later. Mike is at his locker
Bloodrayne
That kid was really scared of us.
Vampir
That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.
Spiky Vampire
Yeah, we're cool, huh? [the Goth kids happen upon the Vampire kids]
Pete
What the hell are those kids doing?
Henrietta
Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
Pete
Are they trying to be Goth?
Michael
No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.
Henrietta
But they can't dress like that. That's our style.
Midnight Vampire
Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too.
Vampir
Tommy Petros? Is he cool?
Bloodrayne
Yeah, he's cool enough.
Vampir
All right. [the Vamps and Goths face each other]
Pete
So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?
Vampir
We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.
Michael
Aren't you Mike Makowski?
Vampir
That's Vampir Makowski now.
Henrietta
You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!
Sparkly Vampire
Hey, we're just as dark as you guys, maybe darker!
Pete
Really. Do you guys even smoke?
Vampir
Of course not. Smoking's bad for you.
Other Vamps
Yeah.
Pete
[buries his face in his left hand] Oh my God.
Vampir
You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.
Pete
All right, Count Fagula, you go do that. [the Vamps leave]
Butters' house, after school. Butters runs inside in a panic, looks around, then heads for the sofa.
Butters
Mom, mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
Linda
[sewing a scarf] Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.
Butters
Oh no, what'd I do this time?
Linda
You just march on in there.
Butters
[hangs his head and goes in] Oh jeez...
The kitchen. Butters walks in and looks at Stephen, who's by the sink waiting with his arms crossed. To his left are a glass of milk and a box of Hamburger Helper.
Stephen
You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?! [holds up the box] It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?! [Butters begins to tap his fists together, nervously] Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!
Butters
I have no idea, sir.
Stephen
I'll tell you why! [walks over to the pantry and opens the door] Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!
Butters
Uh, I'm sorry, Dad. I-it's just I've been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were-
Stephen
What keeps a family together, Butters?!
Butters
A well-organized pantry.
Stephen
That's right! [starts throwing food out of the pantry on to the floor] If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong! [stops] Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!
Butters
Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
Stephen
You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!
Butters
[hangs his head] Yes sir. [Stephen walks away. Butters turns to the task at hand and begins putting stuff away] Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. [stops and thinks]
South Park Elementary, next day, recess. The Vamp kids are on the merry-go-round gathered around Vampir
Vampir

[reading from a book] ...All mortals share a soft repose,My soul doth dreadful vigils keep, More keen than which hell scarcely knows.

</i>
Sparkly Vampire
What is that kid doing?
Butters
[walks towards them with hands outstretched] Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing? [pulls out the crucifix he used on them a few days before and sets it down on the snow, then continues towards them, hands outstretched] I- I'm Butters.
Vampir
So?
Butters
O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
Vampir
What?
Butters
Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
Cowlick Vampire
You're not cool enough to be one of us.
Butters
Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
Vampir
We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.
Butters
Yes! Yes, anything else?
Midnight Vampire
I want some Cheetos.
Butters
Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
The Goth Corner at South Park Elementary. The Goth kids are listening to music as a soccer ball rolls to a stop in front of them.
Singer
I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...
Boy 1
[with dark blond hair] Where did it go? Do you see where it went?
Boy 2
[with black hair] Yeah, it's right over there by those vampire kids. [Boy 1 retrieves the ball and walks away]
Pete
[delayed reaction] What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!
Boy 1
Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?
Michael
So lame. So... lame...
Henrietta
You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.
Michael
Sooo lame! [two Vamps walk out of the door behind him]
Little Vamp
See? Isn't it cool back here? It's all dark and isolated.
Shades Vamp
This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.
Henrietta
Get out of our space, you little twerps!
Pete
More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
The woods, night. Butters is walking through them with drinks and some food. He reaches a small campfire where five of the six Vamps wait for him. Vampir is missing.
Butters
I have done what you've asked. [sets down the goods] A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
Vampir
[walks into view] You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?
Butters
Yeah, I guess.
Vampir
Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.
Butters
Well I'm sick of bein'- bein' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
Vampir
Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin! [they all walk away, leaving behind the Dr. Pepper and Twizzlers. They walk to South Park Mall] This way. Prepare thyself. [the mall is still open, so they walk over to Hot Topic and enter. The Vamps begin checking out clothes for Butters to wear as a new Vamp. The Midnight Vamp gets some fake teeth with fangs while the Cowlick Vamp gets some necklaces and rings. They outfit Butters with them. The Sparkly Vamp gets some hairspray and she and the Spiky Vamp spray Butters' hair with it. Bloodrayne measures him for collars and bracelets. Finally, all six Vamps step away, and a new Vamp is born]
Butters
Whoa.
Vampir
And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se! [walks away and pours out a bottle of Clamato juice into a goblet for Butters to drink] With this, thy transformation is done. [Butters takes a sip, then immediately spits it out]
Butters
Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. [the Vamps leave Hot Topic]
Vampir
It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires. [Butters begins to laugh, then cackle.]
Butters' home, night. He walks into the living room, and Stephen runs up to him
Stephen
There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?! [Butters just walks by]
Linda
Butters, what have you done to your hair? [Butters heads for the stairs]
Stephen
Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister! [Butters stops]
Butters
I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
Linda
What on Earth?
Stephen
That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!
Butters
You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. [smiles knowingly. His parents are perplexed]
Stephen
All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna- [Butters hisses at him] Ah!
Linda
Butters? [Butters hisses at them a few times, and Linda clings to Stephen. Butters goes upstairs]
Butters
I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. [his parents are stunned and just look at each other.]
Principal's Office, day
Principal Victoria
Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.
Pete
...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.
Michael
[slowly, for emphasis] We aren't vampires.
Principal Victoria
I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-
Pete
We aren't trying to be popular!
Principal Victoria
-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. [the door opens behind the Goths]
Mr. Mackey
[enters with Vampir and two younger Vamps] Here's a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm'kay.
Vampir
Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?
Principal Victoria
I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-
Michael
[slowly, for emphasis] We aren't friends!
Vampir
Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.
The waiting room outside the Principal's office. The Goths exit and immediately whip out smokes and lighters
Michael
Allison Merch is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.
Pete
Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. [they all look at each other thoughtfully]
Goth Corner, a day or two later. The Goths are now dressed as normal kids, but their hair is still colored as before.
Pete
Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. [the soccer ball bounces towards the Goth kids again and stops in front of Henrietta]
Boy 1
It went this way?
Boy 3
[with very short hair] Yeah, it's over there by that fat girl, the big-nosed kid, the midget, and the kid with pock marks on his face. [Boy 1 sees the ball, walks over, picks it up, and leaves]
Michael
So we're back to that, are we?
Firkle
Shit.
Pete
[stands up] Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.
Cartman's room, night. He's asleep with the covers off. All of a sudden, Butters is perched on the inside of Cartman's window doors. The other one is open. Butters hisses.
Butters
Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee. [he jumps down from the window and hops onto Cartman's bed, ready to pounce on his throat. He wiggles his fingers, then relaxes them and grips Cartman's head and back] Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. [rears back and bites into Cartman's neck, making sucking sounds. Cartman wakes up and looks at him]
Cartman
Butters? [Butters continues] Butters?! [Butters backs up and then hops off the bed]
Butters
I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
Cartman
Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
Butters
I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... [he vomits on Cartman's floor]
Cartman
Dude! [Liane enters]
Liane
You all right, sweetie?
Butters
[advances and hisses at Liane, then runs out through the window and crashes to the ground outside.] U-huh. [bumps into something] Ow.
Liane
What's going on?
Cartman
Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
Liane
Oh dear.
Cartman
Yes.
Henrietta's room, later. The Goth kids are hanging out there.
Michael
I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.
Firkle
Jesus.
Pete
It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening, I mean... why now?
Michael
Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.
Henrietta
It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.
Pete
Whattaya mean?
Henrietta
I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.
A car night. The Goth kids are in it, with Henrietta at the wheel
Pete
Does your mom know you took her car?
Henrietta
Do I care?
Michael
All right, this is probably good enough.
Pete
Yeah, pull over here. [Henrietta pulls over, and the Goth kids leave the car. Henrietta stops by the trunk and pops it open. Inside is Vampir, all tied up.]
Vampir
[tied up and gagged] (Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)
Michael
What should we do with him?
Pete
Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.
Vampir
(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)
Michael
[leans in and puts his hand to his left ear] What's that?
Vampir
(I'm not really a vampire.)
Michael
You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. [moves off and joins the other Goths]
Pete
If we get the right packaging, we can just FedEx him somewhere far way.
Michael
How about we send him to Transylvania?
Pete
No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.
Henrietta
If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.
Goths
[after a few seconds of contemplation] Scottsdale.
The Stotch house. Butters' parents are upstairs. Linda is pounding on the door trying to get Butters to open it.
Linda
Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters? [tries to open the door, but finds it locked] Unbelievable! He's locked the door. [She and Stephen change places and Stephen tries opening the door, but it won't open. He pounds on the door.]
Stephen
Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey! [Butters is in his bed, his arms crossed over his chest. On the headboard are four lit candles. He's hyperventilating] Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!
Butters
What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
Stephen
Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door! [counts up with his fingers] One! Two! [the door is unlocked and opened a little. Stephen pushes the door in and it creaks. Stephen and Linda enter slowly. They see his window is wide open and he's not in bed. There are lit candles everywhere] Uhh, Bu-Butters?
Butters
Hey Dad. [he's crouching on top of his bookcase and startles Stephen]
Stephen
AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!
Butters
I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
Stephen
[angrily] All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!
Butters
Dahhh. [hops down from the bookcase and tries to hop onto his toy box, but he trips and lands on the floor. He gets up, climbs onto the toy box and crouches on the window sill, and hisses at them] I know now what I have to do! [hops down to the ground outside] Myah!
Linda
[walks over to the open window] Stephen, what has happened to our boy?
Stephen
[joins her there] He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.
Village Inn, night. The Goths are inside drinking coffee and moping around
Michael
I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.
Henrietta
He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.
Waitress
Hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again? [pours them another round]
Henrietta
Leave us alone!
Waitress
Bad enough I always get stuck with you Goth kids, now I got Goth kids in my entire section. [she points to them with her left thumb; there are two booths bursting with Vamps. One has seven Vamps, the other has nine]
Pete
They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
Waitress
Looks the same to me.
Pete
I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.
Waitress
[turns to face the Vamps] No, they said they're too young to drink caffeine, so they're havin' orange juice. [turns left and walks away. Pete drops his head on the table and keeps it there]
Henrietta
Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village Inn from us too.
Pete
Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. Freakin' vampires beat us.
Butters
Maybe not. [hisses. He's on all fours on the ledge behind the booths] Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires? [crawls closer to the Goths] I want to help you.
Henrietta
Get away, douchebag.
Butters
Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
Pete
What are you talking about?
Butters
I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. [the Goths look at each other]
South Park Mall, sometime later. Butters leads the Goths to the Place of Transformation, Hot Topic.
Pete
Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?
Butters
Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
Michael
Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.
Pete
How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!
Henrietta
Well, I think we all know what has to be done.
Michael
Yup.
Pete
Let's get to it. [they turn and head into the store. They get aerosol cans and fan out across the store, start spraying, and light the sprays with their lighters, turning the cans into makeshift flamethrowers]
Singer
Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it steal your soul away.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Light the fire. Take control.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it take your soul.
Burn down, burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
And take control.
Burn down... Hot Topic.
Burn it down... Hot Topic.

While the song is playing, the following happens: Michael is the first to torch some clothes. Henrietta follows with the belts and scarves. Pete begins to torch the jewelry
Clerk
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Pete
You should probably get out of here. [Firkle torches some clothes. Henrietta torches the fake teeth and products with fangs on them. Michael torches the sign announcing 25% off body jewelry and fashion belts. Outside, Bloodrayne and the Spiky Vamp arrive in shock]
Spiky Vamp
What the hell are they doing??
Butters
They're putting an end to it! [the clerk runs out of the store]
Clerk
AAAAAAAAAAAAH! [the Goths continue torching the store until it's thoroughly engulfed in flames, then they walk out and leave. The Hot Topic sign above the entrance crashes to the floor.]
The Stotch house, night. Linda is sewing again, Stephen is reading the South Park Gazette.
Butters
[enters the living room happily] Mom, Dad! [closes the front door, runs to the sofa, and stands on the sofa between them.] I changed back!
Stephen
What?
Butters
Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
Linda
We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.
Stephen
That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.
Butters
What's that, Dad?
Stephen
Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!
Butters
Uh oh.
Stephen
Butters, you are grounded!
Butters
Aw, dang it![walks up the stairs to his room.]
Stephen
It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. [they hug each other]
The South Park Elementary School gym, day. The Goth kids address the rest of the school, who are seated on the bleachers
Pete
[at the mic] Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's "fun", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. [everyone begins to applaud the speech. During the applause, Michael steps up to the mic and gives everyone the finger]
Michael
Fuck all of you.
End of The Ungroundable

The Ring
Clyde, Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Token, Jimmy, and Craig are at the school cafeteria, looking at someone from across the room.
Cartman
Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
Stan
I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
Kyle
Yeah, it's just so astounding.
Cartman
Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened. [the boys are looking at Kenny and a girl eating alone together at another table.] Kenny has a girlfriend.
Craig
Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend.
Kyle
This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
Jimmy
Well, so, w-who is she?
Cartman
Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
Butters
[runs up to the boys' table] Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
Stan
What?
Butters
[panting softly] Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!
Stan
Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
Butters
Um, does Kenny like her?
Kyle
I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
Butters
Oh, no. Oh, geez!
Cartman
[getting irritated] Butters, what's the problem?
Butters
Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
Kyle
What?!
Butters
It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. "Tammy Warner is a total slut!"
Cartman
That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
Jimmy
Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me.
Stan
[sighs] All right, come on, guys. [leaves the table with Kyle and Cartman.]
Butters
Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
At the school hall, two girls walk by. One of them chats away at the other.
Girl 1
So, anyway, I passed him a note, but then Johnny... [Kenny walks alone down a different hall. Stan catches up to him]
Stan
Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! [Kyle and Cartman are with him]
Kenny
(Oh, hi, guys.)
Stan
Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
Kenny
(What about her?)
Stan
[sighs and lowers his head] Oh, boy.
Kyle
Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
Kenny
(But what?)
Kyle
W-well, we've heard that she's...
Cartman
Kenny. [deep sigh, puts his right hand on Kenny's back for sympathy] Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
Kenny
[afraid, high voice] (Huh?)
Cartman
Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
Kenny
(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) [jumps for joy, dances down the hall, makes a right and runs off.]
Cartman
[moments later] He took it pretty well.
Tammy is at her locker putting some books away. Kenny skips around the corner, sees her, and runs up to her.
Kenny
[cheerfully] (Hey, Tammy!)
Tammy
Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?
Kenny
(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)
Tammy
TGI Friday's?
Kenny
(Yep. I like the food!)
Tammy
Yeah, okay. But... [walks away a few steps] Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true. [Kenny dances with glee, but Tammy doesn't see this. She gets apologetic] But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault! [Kenny stops dancing] See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers.
Kenny
(Jonas Brothers?)
Tammy
You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control. [Kenny starts dancing again] And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's, [Kenny stops] and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken? [Kenny walks up to her, puts a consoling hand on her shoulder, and sighs]
At the Ticketmaxx store, Kenny is at the counter making a purchase.
Clerk
There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.
Kenny
(Thanks.) [turns around and walks out with his tickets]
Outside, Cartman, Stan and Kyle wait for him.
Cartman
The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? [Kenny continues walking, the other three join him as he walks across the parking lot]
Kyle
Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
Kenny
(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)
Stan
A B.J.?
Kyle
You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
Kenny
(Of course, dude!)
Cartman
[forcibly stops Kenny] Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
Stan
Yeah, dude, that's gross.
Kenny
[turns right and leaves the other boys behind] (I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
Kyle
What kind of protection?
At the drugstore, Kenny walks into it towards the counter. The other boys follow him in.
Kenny
(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)
Clerk 2
Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?
Kenny
(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)
Clerk 2
These here? Why, certainly. [The Clerk reaches for a box on a rack and hands it to Kenny. Kenny reads the cover: "Big Mamba. The world's #1 condom. Trusted for over 50 years."]
Kenny
(Cool!) [Kenny pays for the condoms and turns to head out the door]
Kyle
Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
Kenny
(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
Cartman
[reaches out to Kenny and stops him] Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
Kenny
(Yep! Woo-hoo!) [skips away]
The Denver Pepsi Center, night. The Jonas Brothers are headlining. Inside is a stadium full of tween girls all cheering for the Jonas Brothers to come out.
Tammy
Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome? [the lights go out and cameras begin to take pictures of the stage. Soon the stage lights come up and the Jonas Brothers appear. The girls go wild]
First song.
Joe Jonas
I'm ready to get it on.
But there's no gettin' on until I'm ready.
Too soon, slow down.
Take it easy, oh, my girl, I need your love. Bay-bay!

Jonas Brothers
I can't wait till the day I kiss you.
Until then I have to tease you.
'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty.
She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty.

Joe
Bay-bay! I'm hot.
Nick Jonas
He's hot.
In the audience during the song. The girls react in various ways. Tammy first looks on, then shrieks uncontrollably.
Little Girl
[putting her hands over her crotch] My 'giney tickles! [she scratches her crotch to stop the tickles. Most other girls do the same thing]
Tammy
[grabs onto Kenny's parka] Oh, my God. It's that tingling again. [a girl has left her seat and is in an aisle gyrating her butt up and down. Tammy gets up on her seat and screams towards the band] I love you! [she's shocked at what she just said, then begins dancing in her seat. Kenny sits in his seat unenthused, wondering when the payoff is coming.]
Second song.
Joe
Tell me how was I to know?
Jonas Brothers
You'd take your love and go.
Joe
Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
Jonas Brothers
To put my arm around you?
Joe
The seasons change.
Kevin Jonas
Bay-bay!
Joe
And the world goes round.
Nick
The world goes round and round and round.
In the audience during the song. The girls continue cheering. Tammy stands on her seat, speechless. A little girl runs up on stage, hugs one of the singers, and is hauled away by security. Tammy dances again.
Third song.
Jonas Brothers
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time.
Can't wait 'til you are mine, but it might be a while. 'Cause,
yeah yeah, girl, we can take it slow, so we have room to grow.
And then someday we can get it on.
Until then, go back to Montreal.

Joe
'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!
Nick
Love you, bay-bay!
Kevin
Bay-bay!
In the audience during the song. A girl is carried out on a stretcher.
Tammy
Whoooooo! [a toddler makes her way towards the stage by climbing over the rows of cheering girls] Aaah-oww! [in another seat Mr. Slave is masturbating with his left hand as he reaches towards the stage with his right one.] You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!
Jonas Brothers
Good night, Denver. We love you all! [skips off the stage] We love you, Denver! [skips off the stage] Good night! [skips off the stage]
The stage lights go down, the stadium lights come up, and the girls begin to file out of the Pepsi Center.
Tammy
Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!
Kenny
(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) [grabs her hand and they walk towards the exit]
Usher
And, uh, you too, little girl in the red.
Tammy
[looks over her shoulder] Huh?
Usher
Band would like you to come backstage. You, too, little girl in the puppy T-shirt. [the blonde girl looks down at her shirt, shrieks, and makes her way to the usher]
Tammy
They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!
Kenny
[pulling at Tammy] (No, no, we're going to your place now!)
Tammy
It's a dream come true! [Tammy lets go of Kenny and goes down the aisle towards the usher]
Kenny
[gives chase] (Hey!)
Usher
All right, right this way, girls.
Roadie
Yeah, come on in everyone. The band is waiting for you. [quickly blocks Kenny from entering.] Uh, not you. [kicks Kenny aside a few times]
Kenny
(No, fuck that, dude! I bought the fucking tickets!) [the roadie closes the door and Kenny starts pounding on it] (Hey! What the fuck?!)
Roadie 2
[in a sensuous voice] The Jonas Brothers will be right out, girls. [leaves]
Girl in Puppy T-shirt
Why do you think they called us back here?
Fat Girl
They must-a wanna have sex with us.
Tammy
What? You think so?
Fat Girl
Sure, they're a band. They called us back here so we can give them blowjobs.
Girl in Puppy T-shirt
Well, I'm not doing it! Just 'cause they're rock stars doesn't mean I'll do that!
Girl in O T-shirt
Yeah, I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!
Tammy
Me neither. [suddenly the brothers appear]
Jonas Brothers
Hey, there, girls! [all of a sudden the girls' mouths pop open as their jaws drop. As the brothers talk, they strike poses]
Joe
Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience.
Nick
Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there.
Fat Girl
Let's just get to the blowjobs.
Joe
Blow whats?
Kevin
[to his brothers] I don't know. [to the girls] Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you.
Nick
And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.
Tammy
[perplexed] Purity rings?
Joe
We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
Kevin
And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.
Nick
That's just how we roll.
Kevin
Yeah.
Nick
Yeah. [they high-five each other. In a wide shot, we see Kenny peering in on the exchange through a transom window.]
Joe
So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?
The Girls
[mesmerized] Okay.
Kevin
And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.
The neighborhood bus stop. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman wait for the school bus to arrive. A somber Kenny walks in from right of frame.
Cartman
Well well well, here he comes. It's B.J. McKay and his best friend Bear.
Stan
So how did it go last night? [Kenny breathes in deep and sighs, takes off his left glove and shows the other boys the purity ring Tammy gave him]
Kyle
What's that?
Kenny
(A purity ring.)
Cartman
Purity ring?
Kenny
(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)
Kyle
...Well, what does that mean?
Kenny
(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
Stan
Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a B.J. before you got too old an-
Kenny
(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
Kyle
Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting B.J.s anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
Kenny
(Yeah.) [Kenny crosses his arms and tries his best to be agreeable with Kyle, but looks at his left ring finger and uncrosses his arms, breaking the act] (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) [Kenny walks away bawling. The other boys just watch him leave]
The neighborhood park. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are playing basketball with Craig, Clyde, and Token. Kyle tosses the ball to Craig, who tosses it back to him. Kyle then tosses the ball to Token...
Butters
[runs up to the boys] Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
Kyle
Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
Butters
Uh, what's that?
Stan
They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
Butters
[gets pensive] Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
Montage.
Jonas Brothers
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
Can't just do whatever I feel like, I've got to stay right, just and true.
I can't hang out with my buddies and get into trouble, 
'Cause now we're both wearing these rings for each other.
But who needs sex and drugs and partying 
When we can cook a meal, then sit around and watch Netflix...
Bay-bay!
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me that I must behave.
No need to chase after girls; it's a promise I can never break.
I made a commitment and it is forever, 
So we can spend every waking minute together.
And if we get bored it won't be a problem, 
'Cause we can just hang out with other couples who wear these rings...
Bay-bay!

Kenny walks down a side street alone. He looks at his purity ring, still on his finger. Joe leads the Jonas Brothers in a song. Kenny looks out the living room window as Stan, Kyle, and Cartman toilet-paper the houses across the street. Kenny visits Tammy and they both stare at their rings. Kenny stares from afar as Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Butters, Craig and Jimmy put the finishing touch on a snowman - a huge penis and set of balls, propped up by a twig. Kenny walks off, unable to enjoy the project. Kenny and Tammy eat frozen dinners at her table as she studies. Kenny and Tammy watch TV on her sofa, but Kenny is bored and has his head resting on his right hand. A shot of the Jonas Brothers. Kenny looks at two sluts walk by, his left hand stretched out. They ignore him. Kenny and Tammy stand in the middle of the Farmer's Market as people walk by around them. Kenny is back at Tammy's eating frozen dinner. Another shot of the Jonas Brothers. Kenny and Tammy sit on a bench at Stark's Pond. They're in Tammy's living room watching TV again. Now they're in a group meeting of purity couples.
Purity Boy 1
Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?
Purity Boy 2
You know? What Carole and I enjoy is Grey's Anatomy. We love Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Carole?
Purity Boy 3
We adore Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Nancy?
Nancy
Adore it. Kenny and Tammy, do you watch Grey's Anatomy?
Purity Boy 1
We look forward to it all week long. [chuckles. Sarah laughs with him]
Purity Boy 3
Sure is sweet.
Purity Boy 1
It's the most fun I've had in weeks. [laughter]
Jonas Brothers
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
What I cannot do.
Bay... bay...
Baaay...
Baybay.
Baybay.
Baaaybaaaaay.

Turns out the Jonas Brothers were shooting a video.
Director
Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys.
Joe
This is bullpucky!
Kevin
Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!
Director
Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem.
The director's office, moments later.
Joe
Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!
Kevin
Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe.
Disney Exec 1
Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image.
Joe
We don't care about the company.
Director
And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?
Kevin
We aren'--we aren't afraid of him.
Disney Exec 2
Well, I hope you're right, because the boss is on his way here. Now.
Disney Exec 3
[looks out the door] Oh Jesus, he's here. The boss is here!
Kevin
Let's be strong, guys.
Disney Exec 3
[opens the door just a crack and looks out again] Hello sir. How was your trip? [the door flies open and in walks a swaggering Mickey Mouse]
Mickey
[looks around] What's all this I'm hearing about not wearing the purity rings, haha?
Director
Uh we'll just leave you alone. [he and the other executives clear out of the room]
Mickey
So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?
Kevin
We... need to talk about something.
Mickey
Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha.
Joe
Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.
Mickey
Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha.
Joe
Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
Mickey
The rings stay on!
Joe
Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage. [Mickey walks over and punches him in the balls. Joe groans and falls forward to the ground]
Mickey
[Mickey kicks Joe's his body with every accented word] You DON'T... FUCKING...TALK to me...Like THAT, haha. You LITTLE... PIECE of... SHIT, Haha! [Joe coughs up some blood] Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! Haha. [Joe begins to stand, then gets some help from his brother. Mickey wipes his gloves clean] Now, do we have a problem?! Haha.
Nick
No, sir.
Kevin
No, Mr. Mouse.
Joe
[softly] No, Mr. Mouse.
Mickey
Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha. [heads for the door] Alright now, get out there and make me some Goddamned money! Haha. [shuts the door behind him as he leaves. A picture of the brothers falls from the back of the door and shatters on the floor.]
A bookstore, day. Kenny looks at some Jonas Brothers DVDs. Kyle walks into view in the fiction section.
Kyle
Yup, he's in here. [Stan and Cartman appear behind him, then they all exit frame, reappearing at the video section.]
Stan
Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
Kyle
We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
Kenny
[unusually resigned] (Look at this. More DVDs.) [shows the DVD to the guys]
Cartman
[takes the DVD and looks at the front cover. Kenny freezes with his left hand held out] Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
Stan
Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
Cartman
[notices that Kenny has stopped responding.] Kenny? Kenny? [snaps his fingers] Kenny? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna look at Playboy? [snaps his fingers again] Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
Stan
[takes the DVD from Cartman and hands it back to Kenny] You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?
Kenny
[starts responding and takes the DVD] (Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)
Stan
[takes Kyle and Cartman aside] You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
Kyle
It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
Cartman
[notices something on the shelf next to him] Oh my God, look at this! [grabs it and looks at it] Motherfucker!
Stan
What? [he and Kyle walk up to get a better look - it's Teen Pop Magazine with Jonas Brothers on the cover]
Cartman
"Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings." These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! [throws the magazine to the floor]
Kyle
Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
Stan
All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! [he and Cartman leave. Kyle stays in place a while, then walks back to Kenny, patting him on the back]
Kyle
Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. [runs off to catch up with the other two boys. Kenny is left caressing the DVD]
Kenny
(Yeah...)
A morning show airs, its graphics showing up first.
Announcer
Live from Five News Studio in Colorado, it's Good Mornin' Denver.
Host
We are joined this morning by the Disney supergroup the Jonas Brothers. Hello boys. [the girls in the audience begin to shriek. Each of the brothers holds a mic]
Joe
Hello.
Host
Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys.
Joe
Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel.
Mickey
[in the control tent with an engineer] In 3-D. Don't forget to mention in 3-D.
Kevin
Oh, oh-and it's gonna be in 3-D. [the girls shriek again]
Host
Now, guys, a lot has been made about your "purity rings". Can you tell us about those?
Joe
Well. Um. [Joe holds up his left hand, palm in, to show off his ring. His brothers do the same seconds later] We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy.
Mickey
Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings. Close-up on the purity rings, haha. [the engineer responds]
Host
That's wonderful, boys. [the camera zooms in on Joe's left ring finger, on which his purity ring rests] It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct?
Nick
Uh huh.
Joe
Yeah. Uh huh.
Kevin
Yeah.
Nick
Yeah.
Host
Well can you give our audience a peek? [to the audience] What do you say girls? Do you want the Jonas Brothers to douse you with their white foam? [the girls shriek again. The brothers whip out some high-pressure hoses with bags of foam attached to them and proceed to spray the audience with streams of white foam. One of their songs plays in the background]
Mickey
Oh boy! This is TV gold, haha. [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman enter the street and make their way through the audience]
Stan
Excuse us. Excuse us.
Girl 2
Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
Host
That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?
Cartman
Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
Stan
Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
Joe
Huh?
Kyle
What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
Mickey
[takes notice] Who the hell are these guys? [takes off his shades and tosses them aside] Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?
Cartman
This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by [a dart strike him in the neck and knocks him out quick] teh- ...tehhhh [falls on his face]
Kyle
Cartman?
Mickey
You aren't ruining my plans this time, DreamWorks, haha! [drops a dart into a blowpipe]
Stan
Dude, who the hell did that? [a dart hits him in the neck] Hwa? [another one hits Kyle in the neck]
Kyle
D'ow... [they both fall over unconscious.]
Some time later, the boys are just now coming to. A POV shot. One of them has opened his eyes and his vision is quite fuzzy. Voices and noises echo around him.
Voice 1
Fifteen minutes, that's fifteen minutes, people!
Voice 2
Get another mic on that drum kit!
Mickey
They almost ruined everything, haha. How did something like this happen, haha? [walks up and gets in the boy's face] Wake up. Wake up, you little prick! Haha. [the boy is alert now] Who do you work for? DreamWorks? [cut to a wide shot revealing a disheveled Stan being held up by his hat. Nearby, Cartman and Kyle are still unconscious.] Answer me, haha!
Stan
We... don't work for anybody.
Mickey
[lets Stan's head drop to the floor] Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha. [Cartman wakes up. Kyle stirs] You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha.
Cartman
The hell did you do to us?!
Mickey
SHUT UP! [kicks Cartman in the balls, making him sit on his ass] Haha.
Red Rocks, that night. The concert begins.
Announcer
And now, Disney Channel presents... the Jonas Brothers 3-D concert spectacular! [the graphic says "the 3D Concert Experience"] Live from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado! [the young girl fans are there cheering and wearing 3-D glasses]
Male Host
Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!
Female Host
In about ten minutes, the Jonas Brothers are going to take the stage in what Disney is calling "the most pure and innocent rock event of the millennia."
A Christian living room.
Blonde Girl
Do we put the 3-D glasses on now, da-da?
Father
Not yet, Katie.
Male Host
Everyone around the country is tuning in to see Disney's latest kid pop stars.
Tammy's living room. She and Kenny sit apart.
Kenny
[depressed] (And not getting a blowjob...)
Male Host
We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.
Backstage. Mickey is facing the boys with a chainsaw in hand. He revs it up.
Mickey
You'd better start talkin', haha! [Stan covers his face, then removes his hands] You'd better start talkin' right now, haha!
Stan
We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
Kyle
We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
Mickey
You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!
Joe
You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
Kevin
We've all angered God.
Mickey
[walks up to them with the chainsaw and revs it up against the boys, who cringe a bit] You think God is in control here, haha?! I am in control! I've been in control since the '50s in case you haven't noticed, haha! [throws the chainsaw aside] You three faggots are going onstage, and [points at the boys] YOU three faggots aren't going to stop me! NOBODY IS RUINING THIS EVENT!! Haha. I've worked too long and too hard to have anybody [Kyle notices he's next to the mic control desk and surreptitiously turns up the Mic 1 slider] fuck this up! [this causes Mickey's voice to be heard by the audience, who quiet down] Where would you be without me, Jonas Brothers? Haha. Your music sucks and you know it! Haha. It's because you make little girls' 'ginies tickle! And when little girls' 'ginies tickle, I make money! Haha. And that's because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?! [Cartman sees the curtain control button and presses it. The curtain rises revealing Mickey Mouse to the audience] Because Christians are retard-ed! Haha. [Mickey is facing the boys, so he doesn't notice anything happening behind him yet] They believe in a talking dead guy! Haha. [having heard his own echo, he blanches and turns around. He now sees the audience] Ohhh. Haha. Hello, folks.
Audience
BOOO!!
Mickey
Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers.
Joe
Come on guys. [the brothers turn left and walk offstage and the booing continues]
Mickey
No! Stop! Bring them back here!
Roadie
It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out.
Mickey
NO! NO GODDAMNIT! NO! SHUT UP! SHUT! UP! AAAAAAGH! [Mickey suddenly blows up to a height of some 40 feet and starts breathing fire on the audience. The girls scatter]
Father
[walks up to the TV and turns it off] That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.
Channel 4 Breaking News.
Reporter
Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit.
Mickey
[floating over the city like a Thanksgiving Day float] Vengeance is mine! You are all ants and I am your destroyer, haha.
Reporter
The Disney purity ring venture will now most likely prove a marketing bust, as Mickey returns to Valhalla to slumber and feed. [Kenny offers Tammy the Grey's Anatomy DVD, but she looks at her purity ring]
Tammy
Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring.
Kenny
(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
Tammy
No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken.
Kenny
(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??) [throws away the DVD] (Really?)
Tammy
Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
Kenny
(Yeah. Screw this crap!) [as one they take off their rings and throw them to the floor and hug each other]
Tammy
Oh I feel better already!
Kenny
(Me too!)
Tammy
What say you and me... go to TGI Fridays?
Kenny
[jumps for joy] (Woo-hoo!!) [takes her hand and runs out the door with her]
A funeral, some days later. Father Maxi is leading the service.
Father Maxi
And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world...
Cartman
[during the eulogy] I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
Kyle
Well, now we know.
Cartman
And knowing is half the battle.
End of The Ring

South Park, night. A shot of a newspaper, the South Park Herald. Some headlines are: "Crime Rate Up," "No End In Sight!!" The camera zooms out to reveal the newspaper lying on the street, hanging over the curb. Dramatic music plays as a car zooms past the paper.
Cartman
[voice over] The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse. [A shot of Tele's TV store "Closed until further notice due to BAD ECONOMY"] The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down. [a shadow runs across the screen, in a cape. Next scene: an alley looking towards the street. An Obama poster for CHANGE is shown, with WHEN? spray-painted over the word] Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things. [the shadow climbs up a pipe and runs across the roof of the building opposite the alley entrance] He didn't. [next shot is that of a street under a threatening red sky] As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection. [another alley. An aluminum trash can falls over, spilling its contents. The shadow appears on a wall, larger than life, then runs away] There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage. [A rain gutter is shown. The shadow runs across the screen again, closer to the camera] To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man. [another rooftop. The camera finds the shadow and zooms in on it.] I'm the hero this town needs. I am... [the shadow turns and is lit up. It's Cartman dressed as...] the Coon! [Cartman looks up to the sky, and graphics for "The Coon" pop up. Next scene, the Coon runs down a street and leaps onto the roof of a car] As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. [he leaps off the car]
A park bench in the city. A couple sits on it, the partners gazing into each other's eyes.
Josh
Lisa I had a really great time tonight.
Lisa
I did too, Josh.
Josh
Would you... mind very much if I kissed you?
Lisa
Not at all. [they start kissing. A pair of binoculars spies them from some distance.]
The Coon
[voice over. The Coon is on the roof of a public restroom house looking through the binoculars] A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon.
Lisa
O-hoh, yes Josh. Yehehessss!
The Coon
[leaps into action] Let her go!
Josh
[points to himself] 'Scuse me?
The Coon
You aren't raping anyone tonight!
Josh
Oh, it's a talking squirrel. [The Coon runs at him, leaps onto the bench, and starts clawing at him] Oh!
Lisa
Ah!
Josh
Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!
The Coon
[stops clawing and says to Lisa] Get out of here! Get to safety! [Lisa gets up and runs away screaming. The Coon gets back to clawing at Josh]
Josh
Ugh! L-lisa! Call me! Oh! Ow!
The Coon
[voice over as he leaps off the chair and runs off] Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there?
Josh
[gently stroking the cuts] Oh that really stings.
Park County Police Station, night.
Officer 1
Here's that file on the Rodriguez case, detective.
Sgt. Yates
Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to- [his eyes widen at something behind Murphy. It's... The Coon, perched on an open window. Murphy turns to look and does a double-take]
The Coon
Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet.
Sgt. Yates
Oh, not this kid again.
Officer 1
Hey, you get out of here. Out.
The Coon
There was another rapist in the park tonight. [jumps into the station] It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and it stinks to the top.
Sgt. Yates
What?
The Coon
I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.
Sgt. Yates
Jesus Christ, [looks at the other detectives] can we get a lock on that window? [he turns to look at the Coon] Look kid, you need to stop- [his eyes widen again. Murphy looks over his shoulder again - The Coon is gone, and the window curtains softly sway]
Officer 1
He's gone.
The Coon
[steps out from behind a file cabinet at the other end of the floor] No, I'm just over here now. [all the detectives turn to face him] What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences?
Sgt. Yates
Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!
Officer 1
Jail's full, sir.
Sgt. Yates
Whatever. Then we'll just put you in- [is surprised again. The other detectives are also surprised, as the Coon isn't by the file cabinet anymore.]
The Coon
[appears by the window again] Now I'm back over here.
Sgt. Yates
[walks towards the window] Just get out of here before we-! [another surprised look. The camera looks at an empty floor space]
The Coon
I'm right here now. [the camera moves to the right until he appears]
Sgt. Yates
All right, stop it!
The Coon
Yes, I have to go now. [turns to the window, reaches over and grabs a box, and carries it over to the officers] But in the meantime I have something that might interest you. [turns and walks back to the window] Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective!
Sgt. Yates
What's in here? [two of his officers walk over to open the box. The window is shown again and the Coon is gone. The officers open the box and pull out some shirts - "Who is the Coon?" and the Coon mask are on the front of the shirts]
Neighborhood bus stop, day. Stan, Kenny, and Kyle wait for the bus. Cartman walks up to them.
Cartman
Hey guys. Good morning. [the guys don't respond to him at all] You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
Stan
Who's the Coon?
Cartman
I know, right? [enunciating] "Who is the Coon?" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
Kyle
...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
Cartman
[stunned, turns to Kyle and points] You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
Kyle
...Dude, what?!
Cartman
He's not a fag!
Kyle
Why do you care?
Cartman
[straightens up and moves off a bit] Oh. I uh... well I ah ah [crosses his arms] I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term "fag," Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante? [neither of them answer him] Kenny?
South Park Elementary, day. Cartman is giving an oral report on the Coon, in the form of a FAQ.
Cartman
And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he? [he's wearing a "Who is the Coon?" shirt] Is he a hero or a menace? [half the class is bored, and Clyde is asleep at his desk. Mr. Garrison reads quietly at his desk] While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... "Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?" What we all need now- [spots the sleeper] Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important. [Clyde wakes up and looks around in a daze] What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
Walgreen's rooftop, that night. The Coon stands near the edge of the roof waiting for spectators.
The Coon
[voice over] Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city. [another little superhero walks up to the edge of roof a few feet from the Coon] And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are- [the Coon notices] Who the hell is that? [looks the new hero over a few times, then walks up to him and asks] Who the hell are you?
M
[this hero wears an M on his shirt and a ? on his hood] I'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night. As violence and darkness take over the streets, I work to rid this city of crime. I'm the symbol this town needs.
The Coon
Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs! [M ignores him] Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first!
M
Nuh uh.
The Coon
Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?
M
I am Mysterion.
The Coon
Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!
Mysterion
I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.
The Coon
Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.
Mysterion
I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.
The Coon
[thinks for a few seconds] Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!
Mysterion
I really don't care who you are.
The Coon
Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!
Mysterion
Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?
The Coon
No, I'm no- I [makes his voice gruff again] I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am!
Mysterion
I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. [leaps off the roof and out of view]
The Coon
NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you! [no one replies] Motherfucker!
South Park Elementary playground, day. The camera looks at various kids at play.
Cartman
[voice over. He's seated alone on a merry-go-round] Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens. [shuts his eyes] No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus. [opens his eyes, keeping a look of determination on his face] Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
Tomorrow arrives, and the Airport Hilton is shown. Event for that day, Coonicon.
The Airport Hilton. Inside, The Coon has set up a convention for himself. A framed poster announced the Coon, Live and In Person.
The Coon
[alone in the room] How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous!
Maitre D
Got everything you need here, sir? Okay on beverages, buffet items?
The Coon
Yes, it's fine!
Maitre D
Great. Hey, I just want to say that the Airport Hilton really appreciates your continued business.
The Coon
What do you mean "continued"? You don't know who I am!
Maitre D
Aren't you that little boy who had his ginger pride rally and his AIDS benefit here, before?
The Coon
No, I'm not that kid!
Maitre D
Oh. Oh oh really? Oh my bad. I'm actually relieved. That kid was kind of a douchebag.
The Coon
[looks back at him] You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!
Cartman's house, night. Cartman returns home from the Coonicon depressed. He walks in slowly and kicks the door shut.
Cartman
[sadly] Hunh!
Liane
Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?
Cartman
I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
Liane
[puts her left hand on his right shoulder] Aww, what happened, hun?
Cartman
I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
A Channel 9 Newscast begins.
Anchor
Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.
Cartman
[suddenly hopeful, looks at the TV] Wha, what?
Anchor
But who exactly is... Mysterion? [a silhouette appears, but it doesn't look like the Coon's]
Cartman
[angrily] What?!
Anchor
Curious crowds in the town of South Park, Colorado. [people mill around looking for pictures of Mysterion to take] They've brought binoculars and camera phones trying to get a shot of a mysterious superhero.
Man 1
Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.
Woman 1
He jumped down from the fire escape stairs, and then he just ran off. We barely got a look at him.
Man 2
To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!
Crowd
Yeah! [the man grins, showing off some gold teeth]
Man 3
Well I, I think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? A, a symbol that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind.
Cartman
Fuckin' butthole!
Man 4
[behind the wheel] Well if you ask me, he's a menace. There's no room for vigilantism in today's world!
Reporter
[showing some "AMATEUR SKETCH" images worthy of a graphic novel] This artist rendition of Mysterion has already generated thousands of copies.
Cartman
You gotta be kidding me!
Reporter
As hundreds of people gather to try and get a glimpse of the superhero, one question remains: Who is Mysterion? [everyone around him begins to ask the same question]
Anchor
If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline.
Cartman
[shakes in anger] AAAAAHT!! [turns right and leaves in a huff]
News stand, night. The headline on today's South Park Herald: "Who Is Mysterion?" The camera pulls back to reveal Mysterion looking around and running down the sidewalk across the street.
Mysterion
[voice over] I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime. [a shot of City Hall. Mysterion appears on the roof by the dome] I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe. [he leaps off the roof and soon climbs up a rain gutter] Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. [climbs in through a window ...into the police station.]
Park County Police Station.
Sgt. Yates
Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?
Mysterion
There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.
Officer 2
We'll get right on it, Mysterion. Thank you. Thank you for all your help. [Mysterion climbs out the window and goes down the fire escape ladder. The officer walks over to the window] Godspeed, Mysterion!
Sgt. Yates
You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world! [as Mysterion walks away from the police station, the Coon jumps into his path.]
The Coon
Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!
Mysterion
This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-
Mysterion, The Coon
Answer the call to save her.
The Coon
That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!
Mysterion
I don't have time for this. [brings out some fireworks and lights the fuse. He drops the fireworks on the ground and leaves. They pop up and deter the Coon from following him. When the smoke clears the Coon looks around and doesn't see anyone.]
The Coon
Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole! [to the officers on the second floor] Hey, he's got fireworks!
South Park Elementary, day. A pissed-off Cartman, wearing his "Who is the Coon?" T-shirt, walks down the hall until he finds his classmates.
Cartman
So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
Stan
Not really.
Cartman
Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! [grabs Stan's right hand and sniffs it vigorously, then lets it go and looks around for other suspects]
Stan
Dude, what the hell?
Cartman
Aha! Kenny! I should have known! [walks over to Kenny's locker and points] Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?! [points at Kenny] Unless you are Mysterion!
Stan
[opens his door to demonstrate something] Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
Clyde
Yeah, so do I.
Cartman
What?! Why?
Clyde
I don't know, it's just a cool costume.
Cartman
It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
Wendy
[walking by] How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
Cartman
[gasps and walks away a bit to watch Wendy leave] Fucking bitch...
U Stor It storage facility, night. Two pigeons perched on the top of the sign suddenly take wing.
The Coon
[voice over] I had no choice. [he peeks out from behind a building, then runs] I was at the end of my rope. [he hears a sound and turns to its direction] Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society.
A Voice
Hahahahahahahahaaa... Look what the cat dragged in.
The Coon
Come out where I can see you!
A Voice
What's the matter, Coon? Nervous?
The Coon
[voice over] I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need.
A Voice
How utterly delightful! The heroic and mighty Coon [Professor Chaos leaps into view] come to put a stop to me again.
The Coon
[voice over] Chaos. I need to keep on my toes. [speaks] I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information.
Professor Chaos
Oh I'm sure you do. But you see I [almost trips on his cape] whoop. [recovers] But you see I also know you like to beat me up.
The Coon
I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity. [the two adversaries begin to circle each other]
Professor Chaos
Oh I'm close. And I'll put an end to him, and all of you goody-two-shoe heroes!
The Coon
I'm not on his side!
Professor Chaos
Do you think I'm a fool?! All those times you stopped me from my acts of evil! All those times you tricked me into meeting you, and then ga- and then gave me titty-twisters! Not this time, Coon! I finally learned my lesson! Now, General Disarray! [General Disarray holds a rope on the roof behind the Coon at the end of the storage building. He jumps down and swings towards the Coon and knocks him down] Yeah-ha! [General Disarray tries to keep the Coon on the ground.]
The Coon
That's it! [stands up]
Professor Chaos
O- oh careful General Disarray.
The Coon
Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!
Professor Chaos
Hehyeah! We beat him, General Disarray! [General Disarray has the Coon in a choke hold]
The Coon
Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!
Professor Chaos
Let him go, General Disarray! [General Disarray lets go and hops off. Professor Chaos puts his fists to his waist] Why would you help us?!
The Coon
Because Mysterion is trying to [bumps General Disarray off. General Disarray strikes a couple of trash cans and gets up a bit dazed] You fucker, that fuckin' hurt! [turns towards Professor Chaos] Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job!
Professor Chaos
But you both fight for justice and good.
The Coon
Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!
Professor Chaos
Very well. I will show you what we know about Mysterion's identity, but if this is some kind of setup-
The Coon
N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people.
Professor Chaos
Weh- oh yeah. [turns and walks away. General Disarray walks away also, and the Coon follows them]
The Coon
[voice over] I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move.
Kyle's room, night. Kyle sits at his desk deep in thought.
Mysterion
[on Kyle's bed] Hello Kyle.
Kyle
[looks, then jumps in his seat] Whoa, what the?
Mysterion
Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
Kyle
Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.
Mysterion
Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
Kyle
Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
Mysterion
[turns away from Kyle] I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.
Kyle
Who? Me? Why?
Mysterion
Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. [looks over his shoulder. Kyle just stands there.]
U Stor It storage facility, night.
Professor Chaos
This way! We will now show you our secret headquarters of DOOM.
The Coon
You guys have your own storage facility?
Professor Chaos
Actually it belongs to General Disarray's grandma, um but she lets us use it. [General Disarray removes the lock from the unit and tries to lift the door. Professor Chaos helps him out and holds the door open as General Disarray and the Coon enter, then enters and lets the door drop closed behind them. Professor Chaos leads the Coon through the unit] This is where we come up with all our evil plans. Here's our computer relays. [a TV on a large stereo console with a toy keyboard attached] And this is like a, a cube of chaos that can destroy the world in one second! [an unsolved Rubik's Cube under glass, on a table from which a sign hangs: WARNING DO NOT TOUCH!] And here's some of our evil minions! [hamsters] We have everything we need here. Can I offer you a Coke or a Sprite or something?
The Coon
I'll take a Sprite.
Professor Chaos
Uhget the Coon a Sprite, General Disarray. [General Disarray leaves to get the Sprite while Professor Chaos takes the Coon to a wall with pictures of the other guys in class on it] As you can see we too have been working hard on Mysterion's identity.
The Coon
You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that "Who Is The Coon?" T-shirt I gave you?
Professor Chaos
Oh yeah, I think it's around here somewhere. Uh, using our photos we are tryin' to pinpoint Mysterion's identity.
The Coon
Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion.
Professor Chaos
No, he's too fat. Based on his body type it's gotta be someone like Stan or Kyle. [The Coon turns away, insulted, but his eyes pop open as he sees who the Coon suspects are: Harvey Fierstein, Cartman, and Bruce Vilanch. It just makes him angrier]
The Coon
Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all.
Channel Nine News splash screen comes up.
Anchor
The clock is ticking and the citizens of South Park are gripped in fear. Two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if Mysterion [a pic of Mysterion appears] does not reveal his identity.
Professor Chaos
[from his headquarters, reading a prepared statement] Mark my words, South Park! Your precious hero is now, uh, your undoing! If Mysterion does not unmask himself publicly by Wednesday night, I am going to blow up... a hospital. Blow up a hospital? [looks off to his right] I'm not gonna blow up any hospital. Are you nuts? What? [turns to the camera] Uh, the choice is yours, Mysterion! Unmask yourself or hundreds will die! Hahaha. [looks off to his right again] Jesus Christ.
Anchor
Since the threat was issued there has been no sign of Mysterion. Where is Mysterion?
Anchor 2
[through his teeth] Where is Mysterion?
On the first floor of a construction site. Chaos, Coon, and Disarray are there with lots of TNT piled up around them. There are no walls up, so the floor is open.
Professor Chaos
Hey Coon w-we aren't actually gonna blo- blow up anything, are we?
The Coon
If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats?
Professor Chaos
But you really wanna blow up a hospital? I mean, a-aren't you a good guy?
The Coon
Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos.
General Disarray
[walks up to Professor Chaos] You know, I've been thinking: if we're really evil villains, then we should betray him, and blow him up with the hospital.
The Coon
You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?! [turns and runs to the edge of the floor] Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff! [jumps down to the ground]
Professor Chaos
Aww jeez General Disarray, this is a lot more than I ever really intended. [General Disarray almost loses his balance twice, but recovers both times] I mean, well I hate the world and all its puny inhabitants and all but, but blowin' up a hospital? It just seems mean. [a shadow spreads across the floor before them. They look towards the shadow's source and find Mysterion standing on a beam above them. Chaos gasps] Whoa. Oh hamburgers!
General Disarray
AAAGH! [runs away to the other end of the floor and behind some boxes of TNT]
Professor Chaos
Aaah, a m m Mysterion, I b-, I beg you, I mean ah, judahadahada...
Mysterion
Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!
Professor Chaos
Whowell I b- Well I b- ah I just would jes one nigh-, and then the Coon saw it up and I wa able to, and was able to [begins to mumble and fade out]
On the street below people walk along the sidewalks unaware of anything happening above them until a scream is heard.
Professor Chaos
Waaugh!
Man 5
What is that?
On the construction site Professor Chaos and Mysterion fight.
Man 6
Look! Mysterion and Professor Chaos are fighting!
Man 7
Give him hell, Mysterion! [more people appear and begin cheering the fight. General Disarray returns to help Professor Chaos]
Woman 2
Look out Mysterion! General Disarray is behind you! [General Disarray grabs onto Mysterion's left leg]
Officer 3
Jesus Christ, we need backup out here! [a police car pulls up as he says this. A sniper tries to train his scope on Professor Chaos]
Officer 4
I think I can get a shot at Chaos, sir.
Sgt. Yates
[stays his officer's rifle] You think your bullets can hurt him? [Chaos and Disarray have defeated Mysterion, who lies unconscious on his back against some open bags of plaster. The crowd below gasps]
Professor Chaos
Yeah, we did it!
Man 8
[breaking the crowd's silence] He's dead. Mysterion is dead.
Woman 3
Nooo... [begins to sob. Other begin to sob too]
Reporter
The impossible has happened. Mysterion, beloved protector of the city, is dead. Who will save us now?
Man 9
Wait! Look! [Mysterion begins to move and wakes up]
Officer 4
He's all right! [the crowd cheers and the battle between Mysterion and Chaos resumes, with Disarray trying to restrain Mysterion. Mysterion throws him off, and Disarray runs away again]
Cartman
[offscreen] Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
The Coon
[walking up a ramp to the first floor] Fear not everyone! Coon is here to save the day.
Man 10
Isn't that Bruce Vilanch?
Man 11
Be careful Bruce Vilanch! There are superhumans fighting right over there!
Professor Chaos
Okay sorry sorry! I'm sorry! I give up! Please, I give up!
The Coon
Don't worry, Mysterion! [Mysterion gets off Chaos and Chaos stands up] The Coon will now help you!
Professor Chaos
Well, wait! I thought we were workin' together. [the Coon punches him in the mouth] Waaa. [sprouts a bloody nose] Oh jeez, I think I broke a tooth. [covers his face, turns left and runs out of view, mumbling. The crowd cheers some more]
The Coon
That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time.
Mysterion
What next time?
The Coon
Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask. [Mysterion gives this some thought.]
Park County Police Station. Mysterion stands at a podium flanked by the Coon and the Park County police.
Mysterion
Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.
Sgt. Yates
Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante!
The Coon
Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.
Man 12
Don't show your face, Mysterion!
Man 13
You have to be a symbol!
The Coon
So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!
Mysterion
No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. [the camera zooms in on him as he gets ready to remove his mask. As soon as he shows his eyes and nose, the camera stops]
Crowd
Ohhh.
Man 14
[holding a camera] Well I'll be.
The Coon
I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!
Mr. Garrison
Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.
Sgt. Yates
Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail. [hands Mysterion over to Murphy, who escorts him away]
The Coon
[voice over] My entire plan worked to perfection. [holds up his right hand] My work here is done. [leaps away, then appears on the roof of a building] With Mysterion out of the way the Coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe. [runs across the roof and leaps down, holding on to the sides of a ladder. He leaps off the bottom of the ladder and plants his right hand on the ground] Once again, I alone am the symbol this town can stand behind. [he eats a burger meal at a fast food restaurant] Every town needs a hero. [walks down a street towards sunset] Every town needs... a Coon. [looks back at the camera, then turns away and resumes walking. Last scene has the Coon riding down the street on his Big Coon Wheel tricycle]
End of The Coon

Margaritaville
A new building - South Park Bank Savings and Loans. A line of customers waits to advance. Stan and Randy are at the head of the line.
Stan
Do I really have to do this, Dad?
Randy
Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
Stan
But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
Benny
Okay, next please.
Randy
Go on, Stanley. [Stan walks up to Benny's desk and takes a seat.]
Benny
How can I help you, young man?
Stan
I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
Benny
Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone. [they look at each other for a long time]
Stan
Uh, what?
Benny
It's gone. It's all gone.
Stan
What's all gone?
Benny
The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone.
Stan
What do you mean? I have a hundred dollars.
Benny
Not anymore you don't. POOF.
Stan
Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
Benny
I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only.
Stan
I just opened an account.
Benny
Do you have any money invested in this bank?
Stan
No, you just lost it all!
Benny
Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please. [an elderly woman steps up and bumps Stan out of the chair.]
Stan
Hey!
Benny
Hello Mrs. Farnickle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone.
Mrs. Farnickle
What?
Benny
Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please.
Stan
Dad!
Randy
Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
Benny
Oh, Mr. Marsh, don't worry. We can just transfer money from your account into a portfolio with your son's-- aaand it's gone! This line is for people who have money with the bank only. Please step aside! [both Randy and Stan are dumbstruck.]
Breaking news. A 9 News Special Report graphic appears.
Announcer
This is a 9 News Special Report. RECESSION: A NATION IN PERIL.
Anchor
An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt.
Mr. Garrison
[in front of a convenience store] It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished.
Stephen
[in front of the Stotch home] It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!
Butters
[waves to the camera, but his face is blocked by the 9 News logo] Hi, Grandma!
Darryl Weathers
First the money started goin', and now everyone's gettin' laid off work! They took arrr jawbs!
Worker 1
They took our jobs!
Worker 2
[shrieking] Derk er derrrrrr!
Worker 3
Deeekerrdrrr!
Worker 4
Deeerkerrrrrrdrrrr!
Anchor
Just how far will the economy fall? We asked economic reporter Dan Banks for his assessment. [a shot of Dan, who raises a gun to his head and fires, shooting his brains out and falling out of view.] We'll have the rest of Dan's interview tonight at 10.
The Marsh house, dinnertime. Sharon walks in with the simplest dinner: hot dogs and sliced tomatoes. Everyone has a glass of water or soda, Randy has a margarita glass.
Sharon
All right everyone, eat up. [takes her seat]
Randy
Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
Sharon
You said we had to be careful with our money. I've got nothing for a food budget.
Stan
Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
Randy
[grabs a hot dog from the platter] I'll tell you what happened, son. See, there's a bunch of idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had. [slaps the hot dog onto his own plate] They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need-- [grabs his margarita glass and rises from the table] people with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying. [walks over to a Margaritaville margarita blender and loads it with ice. A margarita mix is already in place in the blender] And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing, [puts the ice scooper back into the ice bucket] 'cause they thought money was endless! [starts up the blender, which drowns out whatever he says for the next nine seconds] It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans, [the blender stops] meaning less money coming in. [serves himself a margarita and places the blender back on its base] And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry. [goes back to his seat with his margarita] We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? [sips from his margarita glass]
Stan
Yeah, I think I get it.
The South Park Mall, day. Anyone who has something to say about the economy is preaching to the crowd gathered there.
Orator 1
And so why is our economy failing us? Because the government kept interest rates too low for too long! The government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price! How long will we sit and watch our economy fall... As the people we must...
Orator 2
...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...
Cartman
And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
Randy
[dressed in a drab green toga] There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you! [starts pointing at random people] YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand dollar house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers! [speeds up his rate of pointing] Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!
Man 1
He's right.
Man 2
This is the first guy to actually make sense. [more people are attracted to Randy's preaching]
Randy
Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. [everyone applauds softly]
Sur la Table, day. Stan walks in with the Margaritaville and heads to the counter.
Clerk
Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?
Stan
Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
Clerk
Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh. [Stan tries to put the receipt onto the counter, but the large Margaritaville gets in the way. Stan then just reaches up and the clerk takes the receipt] Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.
Stan
What?
Clerk
I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?
Stan
So?
Clerk
Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
Stan
Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
Clerk
[rests his head on his left hand] Hm... that's improbahbluh, [raises his left hand] but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. [Stan just looks at him]
South Park Mall exterior, just after sunset. Randy is on a table pacing back and forth, again dressed in a toga.
Randy
We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head! [a shot of the Stotches in togas] Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!
Gerald
What can we do, Randy?
Man 3
Yes tell us.
Man 4
Tell us.
Man 5
Tell us what to do.
Man 6
Tell us, Randy, what we should do!
Man 7
What should we do, Randy?!
Randy
We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending! [everyone begins to cheer] The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. [stretches out his arms as the audience cheers him on.]
South Park, sometime later. Everyone is wearing blankets instead of clothes, in the forms of togas and cloaks. People have begun to ride llamas, carry stuff in wooden boxes, and leave bales of hay around for the llamas and oxen. Businesses all along the street have shuttered their doors and windows and gone out of business. It's a much simpler way of living.
Al
[on a llama] Mornin' Ted.
Ted
[shoveling snow off his walkway] Mornin' Al.
At a park nearby, the boys sit on rocky surfaces dressed in togas and being bored. Butters tries to fish for squirrels, but none of the squirrels are biting.
Kyle
Well this sucks!
Clyde
Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
Cartman
[arrives and sighs] Hengh! [the squirrels run off] Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS! [stomps his left foot down] Hengh!
Kyle
You want something new every week, fatass.
Cartman
[leaps towards him] Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
Kyle
My fault?
Cartman
The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
Kyle
[jumps off his rocky perch and faces Cartman] Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!
Butters
Well, [Kyle looks back at him] why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
Kyle
Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
Butters
Well Eric did. [Kyle glares at Cartman again]
Cartman
Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
Kyle
Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it. [the other boys now pay attention to Kyle. Two men watch Kyle from afar.] What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go out and shop. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family.
Man 8
We best speak with the Council, and tell them... a young Jew is speaking heresy towards the Economy.
Big Orange Finance Company, day. Stan reaches its glass doors and pushes his way in backwards, then turns around and walks up to the receptionist's desk.
Receptionist
Can I help you?
Stan
I wanna return this Margaritaville.
Receptionist
O-kay, let me send you into Josh. [next shot is of Josh dipping his finger into a little can of Carmex and spreading it on his lips]
Josh
Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?
Stan
No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
Josh
Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah.
Stan
What?
Josh
Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm.
Stan
Wall Street?
Josh
Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah.
Stan
So?
Josh
Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah... [Stan sighs in frustration]
Park County Community Center, day. Llamas wait in the parking lot with hay bales near them as toga-clad adults walk towards the center's doors. Inside, a council of nine sits in the dark. Six candles give light to two tables. Randy sits on a throne.
Stephen
The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.
Father Maxi
You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword.
Randy
I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
Skeeter
We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.
Randy
Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
Man 9
Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!
Randy
What?!
Man 9
He was saying that... your ideas are false and the Economy is not vengeful. He was rallying people to spend more!
Father Maxi
Spend more?! What mockery is this?!
Randy
Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
The same park as before. The squirrels are back, Cartman joins the other boys on the rocks, resting against one.
Cartman
I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. [begins to sob, and a rowdy crowd approaches from the right]
Kyle
What's that? [a crowd of men runs past them, snatching up squirrels on the way]
Man 10
'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels.
Kyle
What? [the boys stand and follow the men]
Mr. Garrison
Now please, please! [holds his arms up in self-defense]
Man 10
You have sinned!
Mr. Garrison
Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please.
Kyle
What's going on?
Man 10
Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!
Kyle
What did he do?
Man 11
Your teacher was caught buying a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Bed Bath & Beyond!
Man 10
Take that punishment, heathen! [the crowd begins stoning Garrison with squirrels]
Kyle
[steps in between Garrison and the crowd] Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!
Man 10
Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer.
Kyle
Come on, this is ridiculous!
Man 10
What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!
Kyle
Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. [a man behind Principal Victoria moves and hucks a squirrel at Garrison]
Mr. Garrison
Oh. [the crowd gets rowdy again]
Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange. It's a busy day. Stan walks into view from the left.
Stan
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
Stockbroker
Margaritaville?
Stan
My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
Stockbroker
Oh, that makes sense.
Stan
It does?
Stockbroker
You see, son, we lump thousands of these Margaritaville installment plans together into Margaritaville-based securities, then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks.
Stan
So I can return it to a bank?
Stockbroker
Nope, because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their Margaritavilles so the government had to buy the Margaritaville assets from the banks.
Stan
What?!
Stockbroker
Just talk to the Treasury Department in DC. They're the ones who really understand how all this works. [notices some activity on his stocks] Oh, sell sell sell sell sell sell sell!
Stan
Aargh! [walks off with the Margaritaville]
In a meadow near town, day. Kyle has his own Sermon on the Mount.
Kyle
Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit cards to practically anyone who applies for them. [pulls out an envelope] I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card. [from Kyle's position, one can see hundreds of people listening to him] It has no spending limit. [cries of shock rise from the crowd] Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
Park County Community Center. The economic recovery movement council is meeting again.
Man 11
By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!
Randy
We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
Stephen
Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us.
Father Maxi
Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!
Randy
That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
Man 12
Well then, there's only one option: we have to kill the Jew.
Father Maxi
Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew.
Skeeter
I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. [a screeching sound is heard. A hand is seen going down a blackboard. and it belongs to Cartman]
Cartman
Did somebody say "catch a Jew"? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
The U.S. Treasury Department, day. The camera pans down from the top of the building to street level, and shows Stan walking past a statue with the Margaritaville. Stan then goes up the steps and through the domed atrium. Three men gather in front of him and face him. He stops and drops the Margaritaville to the floor.
Treasurer 1
Uhh, how can we help you, young man?
Stan
I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
Treasurer 1
Ohhh that makes sense.
Stan
Nnnaaargh!
Treasurer 1
No problem. We just need to consult the chart. We can determine your property's value and we'll be done.
Stan
[surprised] Really? [puts his hands together] Thank you.
Treasurer 1
Be right back. [they go into a room through the heavy double doors behind them and close the doors. A squawk is heard, then a cleaver and the sound of blood spurting out. Stan is startled. The men come back out through the doors with streaks of blood on them.]
Treasurer 2
Excellent news, sir. We've determined the investment value of your Margaritaville to be... ninety trillion dollars.
Stan
What?!
Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gultch. Many of the boys are inside in the dark, seated at a long table reminiscent of The Last Supper. From left to right are Craig, Timmy, Jason, Cartman, Token, Kyle, Jimmy, Butters, Kenny, Tweek, Ike, and Clyde, all munching on slices of pizza. Some breadsticks are in a basket.
Jimmy
Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.
Kyle
I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
Butters
Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
Kyle
I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. [the other boys gasp and look at Kyle. Tweek and Ike look at Clyde]
Cartman
[stands up in his seat] All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool! [checks for a reaction] That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick! [clears his throat and sits down] Go ahead, Kyle.
Kyle
[looks at Cartman for a few seconds, then enunciates] Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
Jimmy
Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.
Kyle
There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. [looks down at his plate]
The U.S. Treasury Department, day. Stan is still trying to figure things out with Treasury.
Stan
Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
Treasurer 1
What, you think it's worth more?
Stan
No, dude, that doesn't make sense!
Treasurer 2
Well, you don't get ninety trillion dollars, but the chart says that's what it's worth.
Treasurer 3
[runs up to the other two treasurers] Uh oh, problem! Problem again!
Treasurer 2
What is it now?
Treasurer 3
Another insurance company is about to go under; if they do, people could lose millions!
Treasurer 1
Okay, no problem. [the three go behind the double doors again] We'd better consult the chart. [this time one of the doors is left ajar. Stan observes this and then takes the Margaritaville into the chart's room]
The chart room. The three treasurers face three other men at the opposite end of the large chart. These other men sit in high-backed chairs and wear white wigs.
Treasurer 3
Sirs, another insurance company is going under!
Sir 1
Now determining most prudent move for insurance company. [brings down the gavel. Treasurer 2 picks up a chicken and a meat cleaver, puts the chicken down against the edge of the chart, and chops its head off with the meat cleaver. He then drops it into the chart and it stumbles around while Treasurer 3 plays the kazoo. The headless chicken drops onto the bailout button and the button lights up and sets off a bell]
Treasurer 1
Bailout!
Treasurer 3
Most prudent move is a bailout!
Sir 1
Bail out the insurance company! [Stan is upset at this method of resolving a serious economic problem. He picks up the Margaritaville, smashes it into the chart, turns around and leaves]
The city park, evening. A crowd is gathered for some reason...
Man 13
It's a miracle.
Man 14
Why would someone do this? [members of the economic recovery council run up to see what the commotion is about]
Randy
What is this? What's going on?
Stephen
There! Look! [a shot of Kyle signing papers] It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.
Randy
What's he doing?
Stephen
He's... paying for everyone's debts. [a shot of several lines of people walking up to Kyle, who takes each bill, enters the amount due into a card reader, and swipes his card through the reader to pay the debt]
Darryl
Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you.
Randy
But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
Man 15
So that people will have money to spend.
Sheila
[runs up to Kyle] Kyle! [gets on her knees] Kyle, you have to stop this! [begins to cry]
Kyle
It's okay, Ma.
Sheila
No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life! [stands up and walks away] Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! [Randy gets an idea, points towards his house, and leaves. More people walk towards Kyle, and this continues for hours. Kyle begins to moan from lack of energy as he continues paying off debts]
Randy
[returns with his unpaid bills] Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
Kyle
[pays it off, with difficulty.] Heunh. [Randy smiles and walks away]
Man 16
He paid for our debts so we could spend once more. [Kyle has stopped moving. A man steps up to check]
Man 17
He's dead.
Dr. Doctor
[steps up to check Kyle's pulse] No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed. [several men raise Kyle over their heads and gently carry him home. Sheila sobs and follows them. They all go through the living room, up the stairs, into Kyle's room, and lay him down. Sheila waits as the men leave, then leaves and closes the door so Kyle can recover in peace. Beams of light enter through the window]
Channel 9 News. The anchorman speaks.
Anchor
For the first time in almost a year, the economy in South Park has taken a small, but noticeable upturn. [a shot of a bustling mall] Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe... to make purchases. [The Marshes are shopping, and Randy notices something]
Randy
Wow, the new Margaritaville! [holds it up] With salsa dispenser! "Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom." Oh, we need this! [Sharon buries her face in her left hand]
Anchor
Are we out of the woods yet? Only time will tell. But we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again. The person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice. [the person is shown] Barack Obama. [a shot of Obama addressing a cheering crowd]
Kyle
[on the sofa watching the TV] Aww, come on!
End of Margaritaville

Eat, Pray, Queef
South Park Elementary, day. The hallway is shown as the bell rings, and the students pour into the hallway from their classrooms. They're all chatting about something imminent.
Cartman
Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
Wendy
Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?
Stan
What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!
Wendy
What day?
Butters
The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
Clyde
They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
Red
Oh God, that show is so dumb.
Cartman
Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
Tweek
Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
Bebe
Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
Cartman
No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. [walks from his locker to the middle of the hall, turns around, farts, and walks back to his locker. A little girl walks into the fart fumes and all the boys laugh]
Little Girl
Eww! [Butters points at her and laughs cruelly]
Kyle
Come on guys, we gotta go! [leads the boys down the hall]
Jimmy
We're finally gonna learn the shocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
Cartman
Let's get to my house!! [the boys run out of school chattering away while the girls remain in the hall annoyed]
Wendy
God they're so stupid!
Cartman's house, a while later. The boys walk into the living room and arrange themselves before the TV.
Stan
Oh boy!
Butters
This is gonna be great!
Craig
I've been waiting for this all week.
Butters
Oh boy!
Cartman
[walks in with some snacks for himself and spots Craig on the sofa] Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
Craig
Dude, I was here first.
Cartman
It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! [Craig moves to an empty spot on the floor as Cartman takes his place on the sofa]
Butters
Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!
Graphics for the Canada Channel pop up onscreen.
Announcer
You are watching the Canada Channel, the only channel in Canada.
Announcer 2
Previously on Terrance & Phillip: Terrance farted on the American president, but Phillip took the heat. [A shot of Terrance farting on Barack Obama, who appears Canadian onscreen. The boys have a good laugh]
Phillip
[pleading his innocence as a prison guard shoves him into a cell] It wasn't me! [fart. The boys laugh again]
Announcer 2
And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Terrance & Phillip: Blood Rage ["Part 2" appears, followed by "Special Presentation"]
Announcer
...will not be seen tonight, so that we may bring you this Queef Sisters Special!
APRIL FOOLS! A kazoo is heard.
Cartman
What?
Announcer 3
The Canada Channel presents... The Queef Sisters. Katherine and Katie Queef. [a shot of them at the beach farting pink queefs] Two Toronto girls who love shooting air out their vaginas. [a shot of them queefing on a unicorn.] It's The Queef Sisters special on Channel Canada.
A Canadian doctor's clinic. The sisters wait inside, their legs on stirrups. The doctor walks in.
Doctor
Alright Queef Sisters, it's time for your yearly PAP smear and vag exam.
Katie
Alright Doctor.
Katherine
I'm ready, Doctor.
Doctor
[walks over to Katherine] Now I'm just going to check for cysts. [lowers his face and moves in closer for a good look... QUEEF!] Awww! [backs up and hides his face. Katherine begins to laugh. Katie joins in]
Cartman
What the fuck is this?!
Doctor
Now listen heauh! If you queef in my face, then I refuse to be your gynecologist!
Katherine
I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina.
Katie
Huhuhuhu!
Doctor
Well just don't let it happen again! Now I'm going to check for cysts. [lowers his head, quickly glances at Katherine, then lowers his head again. QUEEF! The doctor recoils again] Arh! [Katherine laughs, then Katie joins in. The boys watch this special and aren't moved.] Now stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there! [goes back between Katherine's legs. QUEEF! The doctor hides his face again and the sisters laugh. The doctor is fed up and throws his notepad away] That's it! No PAP smear for you!
Katherine
But doctor, what if I have cancer?
Doctor
You should have thought of that before you queefed in my face three times! [A shot of the boys confused, with Cartman getting mad]
Butters
They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
Katie
Doctor, my sister is just being difficult. Maybe you can just examine my cervix instead.
Doctor
Well alright, let me check for cysts. [goes over to Katie and lowers his head. QUEEF! He backs out] Nooo! [the sisters laugh] That does it, Queef Sisters! I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore! [walks out the door]
Katherine
Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.
Katie
I guess so Katherine.
Cartman
Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
The Canada Broadcasting Channel offices, day. Terrance & Phillip have just watched the same episode the boys did.
Phillip
What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
Terrance
Queef Sisters?!
Network President
That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.
Terrance
You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
Phillip
That's sick!
Network President
You think farts are funny; why not queefs?
Terrance
Because babies come from there!
Network President
Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!
South Park Elementary, day. Cartman is in the hall talking on his cell phone surrounded by other kids.
Cartman
No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
Wendy
[walks up to Stan] What's going on?
Stan
We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
Cartman
You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
Clyde
I threw up on my way home.
Cartman
Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! [more girls begin to appear]
Stan
You tell 'em, Cartman!
Red
What happened?
Butters
They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip! [crosses his arms] They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
Kyle
It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
Bebe
Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
Cartman
You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! [the girls have heard enough and leave]
Bebe
I can't believe they're this upset.
Red
God, they're annoying!
Annie
I don't even know what a queef is.
Wendy
It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.
Annie
Oh.
Red
You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants.
Bebe
Really?
Wendy
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
Meanwhile, just behind them, Cartman has Butters write out a letter as he dictates and paces around the floor.
Cartman
And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
Kyle
Robbed us of our innocence.
Cartman
Yes, that's good.
Butters
[writing left-handed] Robbed us of our innocence... [the girls return]
Wendy
Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.
Stan
What? [a girl moves to the front of the group, and lets loose a queef into Butters' face. Butters is stunned and tries to get the queef off his face as if it were skunk musk]
Butters
Oh God, oh my God no! [runs down the hall and out the front doors of the school, still screaming and trying to get the queef off, then runs all the way home. He runs in, leaving the front door open and his father puzzled. He runs upstairs and into his room, slamming the door shut.]
Stephen
Butters?
The Marsh house, later. Randy is talking on the phone, as Sharon listens in, worried.
Randy
Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye. [hangs up the cordless phone] We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. [starts to go upstairs]
Sharon
Why? What happened?
Randy
[backs down a couple of steps] A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. [goes on upstairs. She looks on for a few seconds]
Sharon
...So?
Stan's room. Stan is sitting at the edge of his bed moping. Randy knocks on the door, then opens it to peek in. He then walks up to Stan and sits next to him on the bed.
Randy
Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
Stan
Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
Randy
I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
Stan
It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
Randy
Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
South Park Elementary Gymnasium, night. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey wait for all the parents take their seats on the bleachers.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face. [immediately people begin whispering to each other]
Gerald
How did this happen?
Stuart
Where were the teachers?!
Mrs. Testaburger
Whoa, whoa whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy?
Man
Just?!
Thomas
We're here to find out why?!
Randy
The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! [more murmuring ensues]
Principal Victoria
Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. [the men look at each other]
Randy
What does that have to do with anything? [the women begin to murmur in reaction to that question]
Live with Regis and Kelly. The camera pulls back in the sign to reveal the studio audience.
Regis
Our next guests have really taken America by storm. Their new hit show is being tuned in by women all over the world. Please welcome the Queef Sisters! [Regis and Kelly stand up to greet the sisters as the sisters go onstage]
Katherine
Oh hello Regis.
Katie
Hello Kelly. [QUEEF. The sisters laugh]
Regis
So, uh, gals, ...you seem to really like queefing.
Katherine
Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it? [rips out a new queef and laughs. The audience applauds and cheers]
Regis
But I mean really, isn't queefing a bit juvenile?
Katie
Men enjoy farts, so why shouldn't women enjoy their queefs?
Katherine
That's right. We've written all aboot it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef.
Kelly
Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. [lets loose a most robust queef]
Regis
D'ohhh! [walks offstage covering his nose as the sisters laugh.]
The Canada Broadcasting Channel offices, day. Terrance & Phillip are there once again.
Network President
Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired.
Terrance & Phillip
Fired?!
Network President
Sorry guys, but this queefing thing is really catching on. [grabs some gift-wrapped boxes from under his desk and carries them to Terrance & Phillip.] Queef Sisters' ratings are through the roof, and to pay them what they're asking we've gotta get rid of you. Goodbye. Here's some cookies. [hands them the boxes]
Terrance
Brian, don't do this!
Phillip
You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
Brian
[prepares himself a drink and walks by his window] Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef. [turns around and glares at the duo] But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!
The Martha Stewart show.
Martha
I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately. [holds up some scissors and construction paper, and the camera pulls back to reveal her genitalia] It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this... [snips away] and cut out little stars and little moon shapes, [puts those stars and moons into her vagina] and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just... [puts the sparkles into the vagina as well] shoot... right up the ol'... there we are. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip. [she queefs and the stars, moons, and sparkles pop out in a fireworks display. She grins] See how pretty that was? It's a good thing.
The segment ends. Next, the Marsh house, day. The Marshes are enjoying a meal. A small sound is heard and Sharon smiles. Stan and Randy freeze, then Randy looks at Sharon.
Randy
What was that?
Sharon
Oh, excuse me, I... [stifles a giggle] I, I had a little air trapped. [Shelly begins to giggle]
Randy
Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
Sharon
[chuckles] Pardon me. [Shelly giggles]
Stan
Mom, gross! [Sharon and Shelly giggle some more]
Randy
Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
Sharon
[giggles and pats her face down with a napkin] Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.
Randy
Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!
Stan
Stop it, Mom!
Randy
Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
Sharon
[giggling] Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [smiles. The family resumes eating quietly until another queef is heard. Sharon and Shelly crack up while Stan and Randy stare at them]
Randy
Sharon! Marsh!
Sharon
Ex-cuse me.
Shelly
Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. [Sharon and Shelly giggle some more]
Randy
That's it, I'm leaving! [leaves the table and heads for the front door]
Stan
I'm going too. [follows Randy]
Sharon
Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!
Randy
That's completely different!
Stan
Yeah it's different, Mom!
Sharon
Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
Randy
[giggles a bit] Heh, yeah?
Sharon
But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
Randy
[giggles with Stan] Yeah?
Sharon
And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. [Randy and Stan glare at her]
Randy
Come on Stanley, let's go. [they turn and head out the front door]
Sharon
Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
Randy
It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! [exits the house and slams the door shut]
The Queef Sisters' house, living room. Katie is on the sofa putting nail polish on the nails of her left foot.
Katie
Look Katherine, I made queef cookies!
Katherine
But those are just ginger snaps, Katie. [Katie queefs on the cookies and voila! The sisters laugh. The doorbell rings] Could you get that, Katie? [queefs on Katie as Katie walks by to get the front door. They giggle. Katherine opens the door and sees Terrance & Phillip staring at her angrily, with their arms crossed over their chests]
Katie
Oh my God! Look, Katherine! It's Canadian television stars Terrance & Phillip!
Katherine
[jumps to her feet] Oh my God, they're famous! [walks up besides Katie] Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy. [queefs twice. The sisters laugh]
Katie
[queefs] Wooo.
Phillip
May we come in, please?
Katherine
Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess. [Terrance & Phillip walk in and look around]
Terrance
Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
Katie
Oho yes, the show is going aboat as well as it could. [queefs]
Terrance
All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!
Phillip
That's right! We've come to kill you! [Terrance pulls out a gun and aims it at them, and they gasp]
Katie
Why kill us? We love you.
Terrance
Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
Katherine
Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols.
Terrance
Your idols?
Katherine
We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand. [the sisters shut their eyes and wait to be shot]
Terrance
[turns around] I don't think I can do it, Phillip. [Katie opens her eyes]
Phillip
Why not? [Katherine opens her eyes]
Terrance
Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
Phillip
What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. [they look over their shoulders at the sisters]
Butters' bedroom, day. He's in bed with an ice pack tied down around his head.
Butters
Ohhhhh ohhhhh. [Cartman enters leading the other boys in class. He's carrying a box]
Cartman
Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
Butters
Oh. Hey fellas.
Cartman
We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
Butters
Aw thanks.
Stan
Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
Butters
Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
Kyle
Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
Butters
My, my picture?
Cartman
You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
License place BM 475. The camera pans up to reveal Terrance driving Phillip, Katherine and Katie down a country road. They pass a sign saying "Entering CANADIAN WINE COUNTRY. Over THREE WINERIES to explore." The four continue down the road until they reach Canadian White Wine Winery. They go in and sample the wine. Terrance finishes his glass and farts into it. The two men laugh. The foursome get back on the road. Sometime later, Katie queefs on Terrance.
Terrance
AAH! [the sisters laugh. The foursome then stops at Canadian Red Wine Winery. Inside they sample more wine and a flatulent sound is heard]
Phillip
Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!
Terrance
No, that was me, Phillip. I farted.
Phillip
Oh. [Both men laugh. The foursome leave and get back on the road. Terrance is still driving. They're all drinking straight from bottles]
Katherine
Oh, this is a dream come true. I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip. [Terrance brakes angrily]
Terrance
Phillip?! I'm Terrance!
Katie
What? I thought you were Terrance.
Phillip
No, I'm Phillip!
Katherine
Oh dear. [they continue down the road, sipping from bottles. Phillip is now driving with Katherine up front while Terrance sits in back with Katie. Katie tosses her bottle back onto the road and starts making out with Terrance.]
The House of Representatives. Some of the boys, their parents, and South Park Elementary staff are presenting their case.
Stephen
A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.
Cartman
Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you [points to the poster] it's not a joke.
Stan
On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
Randy
[walks into view with a mic] I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker [moves the mic to his ass and lets out a squeaking fart, then speaks into the mic again] And then there's The Foghorn [moves the mic to his ass and lets out two farts that sound like a foghorn, then speaks into the mic again] and the "Don't be scared" [moves the mic to his ass and lets out a series of farts that sort of sound like "Don't be scared", then speaks into the mic again] and of course there's the-
Woman
Excuse me. [another woman hands her a mic] Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.
Other Women
That's right! We do.
Woman
For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn. [moves the mic to her vagina and makes it sneeze, then speaks into the mic again] and The Resuscitator [moves the mic to her vagina and makes a sound like an air pump]
Cartman
Sick! Stop it, lady!
Randy
Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! [moves the mic to his ass and lets out a sputtering fart that sounds like a Chinese firecracker]
Woman 2
That's all well and good, but we can do the Road Warrior. [moves the mic to her vagina and...]
Road Warrior Queef
Nooo! We go iiin! We kiiill! No more talk! We kiiill! Soon, my dog of war, but we have to do it my way. [switches to another voice] Losers! Losers wait!
Males
[covering their noses] AWWW!
Randy
Jesus Christ!
The Queef Sisters' house, night. In the dark, Phillip is naked and running away from something. A vase flies at him and shatters against a wall.
Phillip
You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! [evades another vase, which shatters against another wall]
Katherine
I'm not your sex toy, you fucking pig! [flings a third vase at him]
Phillip
Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
Katherine
Fuck you, you don't fucking slap me! [a light turns on. Terrance and Katie are in a bed next to them]
Terrance
Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
Phillip
She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!
Terrance
SICK!
Katie
Well what's the big deal? I've been queefing in this bed the entire time.
Terrance
What?! Gross! [punches her on the face with his left fist]
Katie
How dare you?! [punches him back]
Katherine
Get out! Get out both of you! [begins pushing Phillip towards the door] We never want to see you again! [kicks his ass. Soon, both men are out of the bedroom]
Terrance
After everything we've been through? [Katie gives them the last push, shuts the door, and sobs. Katherine joins her, they hug each other, and they queef separately]
The terrace at the Queef Sisters home. Terrance & Phillip stand at the banister, naked and smoking cigarettes.
Terrance
[sighs] What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.
Phillip
Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.
Terrence and Phillip enter the house.
Terrance
Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
Phillip
Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.
Katie
Oh Terrance. [they hug]
Katherine
Phillip! [they hug and move towards Katherine's bed. Each couple starts fucking immediately, with the men on top]
Stan's house, morning. A rooster crows somewhere. Randy steps out to pick up the newspaper. He yawns and reaches down...
Randy
[gasps] Oh my God! [the headline reads "QUEEFING BANNED! ROAD WARRIOR QUEEF SEALS IT!"] Ohmygod! Stan! [turns around and closes the door, then runs to the foot of the stairs] Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!
Stan
[coming down the stairs] No way! We did it?! [twirls around] Yeah!!
Randy
Alright son! Yeah!!
Sharon
[coming in from the kitchen with Shelly] What's going on?
Randy
[thrusts the paper in Sharon's face] HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
Sharon
[resigned] Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.
Randy
Aw come on. [tries to lighten the mood] Just because you can't queef anymore...
Sharon
You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys. [begins to sob] For getting your way... again. [she and Shelly turn around and head back to the kitchen]
Stan
Mom, we didn't mean... [he and Randy are stunned. Randy walks to the sofa and sits down.]
Randy
[exhales] Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. [Stan follows him to the sofa and sits next to him]
Stan
Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
Randy
Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
A recording booth, later. Randy appears alone and starts to sing.
Randy
There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
Randy, Stan
And realize we've been keeping women down.
Mr. Mackey
They have power and they have courage.
Stephen, Butters
And we must all stand by the belief.
Gerald, Kyle
That a woman is strong, and she has the right to queef.
The Males
Fly free. Free to queef aloud; fly free. Let every queef show that you’re proud.
Randy
You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
The Males
You are woman now, and you are free to queef.
Cartman
It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
Mr. Garrison
They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
The Males (Randy)
Queef free (Queef free). Every woman has the right; queef free (Queef free). Let your queefing stars shine bright.
You are woman, hear you roar (queef free), queefing too loud to ignore. Queef a little each day and let your soul take flight!
Ah-aaaaaaah-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, queef free.

Scenes shown during the song: A fire department captain, a car mechanic, a firefighter, a lab technician, a baker, a flight attendant, a doctor, a paramedic, Hillary Clinton, with a queef coming out of her, a dog with five or six puppies at her teats, a pharmacist, a hotel worker, a mother, and an athlete.
A Canadian cathedral, day. Inside this magnificent church are Terrance & Phillip and their brides.
Bishop
For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. [Katherine jumps up and queefs on him] Nooo! [the sisters laugh]
Phillip
Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!
Bishop
Therefore what God has joined together let no man- [Terrance jumps up and farts on him. Phillip laughs. Katie jumps up and queefs on Terrance]
Phillip
Aww. sick! [Terrance jumps up and farts on Katie. Phillip laughs. Katherine comes up and queefs on him. He farts on the bishop]
Bishop
That's it! I now pronounce you farts and queefs! [the couples laugh as the bishop quickly leaves, Canadians laugh]
End of Eat, Pray, Queef



South Park, day. Cartman is walking over to Jimmy's house. He enters the house eating chips. Jimmy is working on new jokes.
Cartman
Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? [closes the door and walks up to Jimmy]
Jimmy
Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy [chokes up] ...rou-routine.
Cartman
Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
Jimmy
Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.
Cartman
[heads to the sofa and lays down on his back] Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
Jimmy
Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.
Cartman
[while munching] No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
Jimmy
Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
Cartman
No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. [Jimmy sighs and throws away a sheet of jokes. Hours later there are many more sheets on the floor]
Jimmy
...So the Pope says, "What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?"
Cartman
Meh. [Jimmy tosses away another crumpled sheet]
Sarah
Here's some fruit, boys. [sets the plate down by Jimmy] Better for you than potato chips. Oh Jimmy, look out, there's a black widow! [pulls out a newspaper from under Jimmy's desk and smashes the spider with it]
Jimmy
Wow, thanks Mom. [she turns and walks away] You might have saved my life.
Cartman
Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
Jimmy
You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. [gets an idea, indicated by a small bell]
Cartman
Yeah, I like fishsticks.
Jimmy
Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks. [now he writes the joke excitedly] Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? [Cartman looks at him, then sits up]
Cartman
What, dude, you got something?
Jimmy
Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?
Cartman
Yeah.
Jimmy
You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
Cartman
Yeah.
Jimmy
Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?
Cartman
[thinks through the joke] Fish dicks! Aw dude, that's funny as shit! I think we're really onto something here. Let's try it out on the guys.
South Park Elementary, day. The bell rings and the boys are in the hall. Clyde is putting some books away in his locker when Cartman rounds the corner with three other guys: Jimmy, Kenny and Butters.
Butters
Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.
Jimmy
Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde.
Cartman
Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
Clyde
Hey.
Stan
[walks up to the other guys] What's going on?
Butters
Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
Cartman
Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
Clyde
Yes. [Butters covers his mouth to stifle a laugh]
Cartman
Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
Clyde
Yes. [Butters covers his mouth to stifle a laugh]
Cartman
[points to Clyde with both index fingers] What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
Butters
[runs up to Cartman and Clyde] HA you said you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! [Cartman laughs. Butters soon joins him. Clyde just smiles sheepishly, knowing that's a good joke. Token walks into view and Cartman runs to him. Clyde grins]
Cartman
Token, Token, got a question for you: [clears his throat] Token, do you like fishsticks?
Token
Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. [Butters begins to giggle]
Cartman
[motions to Butters to keep quiet for now] Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters. [back to Token] You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
Token
Yes.
Cartman
What are you?
Butters, Cartman
A gay fish? [Cartman laughs first, then Butters]
Butters
Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley! [runs towards the unseen voice] Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? [A hot new joke is born.]
Mr. Mackey's office. Garrison peeks in...
Mr. Garrison
Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?
Mr. Mackey
Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?
At South Park Market.
Stephen
Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see.
Peterson
Yeah, I like fishsticks.
Stephen
What are you, Peterson? A gay fish? [everyone laughs]
The Jimmy Kimmel Show.
Announcer
And now, here he is! Jimmy Kimmel! [the studio audience cheers as he goes onstage]
Jimmy Kimmel
Alright, hey, how are we all feelin' tonight? [the audience quiets down] So uhhh, let me ask the guys in the audience a question. Do you like fishsticks?
The Guys
Yes.
Jimmy Kimmel
Huh. What are you, a gay fish? [everyone laughs]
The Late Show with David Letterman.
David Letterman
And so uhhh, hey Paul, do you like fishsticks, Paul?
Paul Shaffer
Uhhh, sure?
David Letterman
What are you, Paul, a gay fish? [everyone cracks up over it. Someone in the audience keels over the balcony. Letterman tosses away his notes]
The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
Jay Leno
So apparently more and more Americans are eating fishsticks. Have you seen this? Have you read about this? Loving fishsticks, kinda makes me wonder, you know? What is everybody, a gay fish? [the studio audience roars with laughter and two men in the front row fall off their chairs and throw up.]
Another talk show, but without a studio audience.
Anchor
It is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all border, all races, all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him.
Kanye
Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!
Tom Snyder
You. Really. Don't. Get it.
Kanye
Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know!
Tom Snyder
You're a rapper.
Kanye
Yes.
Tom Snyder
An entrepreneur.
Kanye
Yes.
Tom Snyder
And you like fish dicks.
Kanye
Yes.
Tom Snyder
You're a gay fish.
Kanye
No! I am not no gay fish!
Tom Snyder
Just gay?
Kanye
I'm not gay and I'm not a fish! Man!
Tom Snyder
[this time goes through joke one step at a time] You are male?
Kanye
Damn right I'm male.
Tom Snyder
A male that likes fish dicks.
Kanye
Yeah, I like fishsticks.
Tom Snyder
You like to put fish dicks in your mouth.
Kanye
Yeah.
Tom Snyder
You're a gay fish.
Kanye
Alright, that does it! I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass! [stands up pushes him off his chair]
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are having lunch in the school cafeteria. Stan and Kyle sit opposite each other this time.
Cartman
And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
Kyle
We know, Cartman!
Cartman
Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
Jimmy
P-patent?
Cartman
Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
Jimmy
Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
Cartman
Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! [smiles, takes his tray and walks away]
Kyle
Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
Jimmy
Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...
Kyle
Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
Jimmy
Actually it was potato chips.
Kyle
I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
Jimmy
W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.
Craig
Then just give him half.
Kyle
What?
Craig
I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.
Kyle
Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
Craig
Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.
Kyle
No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"
Craig
Just give him half.
Kanye speaks to a group of reporters at a conference somewhere.
Kanye
There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I'm going to prove once and for all: I'm not a fish. Because I am a genius, I've ascertained that fish have gills. [a doctor steps up next to him] Doctor, do I have gills?
Doctor
He does not have gills.
Kanye
You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions?
Reporter 1
Do you like fishsticks?
Kanye
Love 'em!
Reporter 2
You're a gay fish. [a third reporter laughs and soon the rest of the room is laughing]
Kanye
No I'm not- AAAARGH! [grabs the sides of the podium and shakes with anger]
Late Night with Conan O'Brien.
Conan O'Brien
Alright, recently... Recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here's your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia.
Carlos Mencia
[dancing in his seat] Yeheah, Vive la Mexico!
Conan O'Brien
So Carlos, you've got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?
Mencia
Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause I'm so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, ""Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks?" And my homeboy says "Yeah Carlos" you know, "you're so funny!" And then it just occurred to me. I said, "Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!" [the studio audience roars with laughter, and he begins to dance in his seat again] And this is how I came up with it, mi amigos! [Conan claps. Cartman, looking at the show on TV, is pissed off]
Cartman
[shakes with rage, then turns left and walks away] Motherfucker!
South Park Elementary, day. Cartman runs up to Jimmy in the hallway.
Cartman
Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!
Jimmy
Really?
Cartman
Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
Jimmy
Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.
Cartman
But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
Jimmy
Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
Cartman
What?!
Jimmy
Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
Cartman
Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
Cartman remembers entering Jimmy's house.
Cartman
Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
Jimmy
Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
Cartman
Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
Sarah
Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.
Cartman
Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish? [Jimmy and Cartman laugh, but Cartman notices something on Jimmy's desk.] Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! [gets off the couch, gets a newspaper, walks over to the desk, and smashes the spider dead.]
Jimmy
Wow, thanks Eric.
Back to the present. Jimmy looks helpless.
Jimmy
Is that... Is that how it happened?
Cartman
Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
Jimmy
I'm... I'm sorry?
Cartman
It's cool man, it's cool. [turns around and walks away]
Kanye West in Concert, night.
Announcer
Here he is, y'all! Give it up for Kanye West!
Kanye
[gets onstage] Yo. Ungh. Yo. [turns to look at the audience] Yo, whoa! Whoa, what the hell?! [a lot of audience members carry signs saying that Kanye is a gay fish and that he likes fishsticks]
Audience
Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!
Kanye
Yo, fuck this noise, yo! [throws down his mic and storms offstage]
Kanye's mansion, living room. He looks at a board while his entourage stands at the other end of the room looking at him.
Kanye
Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?
House
Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don't get it, you don't get it.
Kanye
What do you mean, I don't get it, House?! I'm a genius. I'll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let's see... [he's writing on a whiteboard. So far he has "Fishsticks plus Me equals Gayfish"] Somethin' about fishsticks... interacting with me... makes me gay fish.
Aide 1
Kanye, really...
Kanye
Shut up! [looks at the whiteboard again.] Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks? [adds more words to the board] They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim. [begins connecting words] Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?
House
No, because you said you like fish dicks, Kanye! Don't, don't you get it? You see, fish dicks is a is a play on words.
Kanye
I don't need anyone tellin' me "play on words"! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!
The boys' restroom at South Park Elementary, day. Kyle is at the urinal when Cartman walks in a few seconds later.
Cartman
Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
Kyle
Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
Cartman
[walks off a bit] It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke. [Kyle zips up and goes to the sink to wash his hands] I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. [Kyle finishes up, grabs a paper towel, wipes his hands dry, and turns to Cartman]
Kyle
You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
Cartman
You do?
Kyle
Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! [turns and leaves the bathroom]
Cartman
[after some thought] But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
Cartman remembers entering Jimmy's house. This time things go by quickly.
Cartman
Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
Jimmy
Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
Cartman
That's cool. You wanna write some together? [walks out of view]
Jimmy
Hey, that'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
Cartman
[pulls up a chair] Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks.
Jimmy
Hey, you're really onto something there.
Sarah
Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all.
Cartman
Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer. [she walks off] Now let's see... The setup could be... "Do you like fishsticks?"
Jimmy
Right. And then I say, "Yeah."
Cartman
So then I can say, "What are you, a gay fish?"
Jimmy
Oh wow, this is incredible! [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look at the source of the crash. A dragon wanders in]
Sarah
What is that?
Cartman
It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! [leaps out of his seat with a sword out of nowhere and slashes the dragon across the chest, making it bleed. It falls on its back all of a sudden. Eric leaps onto its body and stabs the sword into its chest. It dies.]
Butters
[looks through the window] Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.
Clyde
[opens the front door] He's the most awesome kid in school!
Wendy
And he's not fat at all.
Cartman
Thanks you guys!
Back to the present.
Cartman
Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
Kanye's mansion, living room. He's written down some more stuff and made more connections on the whiteboard.
Kanye
Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy?
Aide 2
Yo Kanye, KANYE! We found him money.
Kanye
Found who?
Aide 2
You told us to track down whoever started the whole fishstick thang. We found out who, dawg.
Mencia
[tied down to a chair in Kanye's study, his voice shaking] Come on, maaaan. What is this, maaaan? What the fuck is goin' on maaaan? [Kanye enters the room. His entourage makes way] Oh fuck maaaan, Kanye Wehhst? Noo shiiit maaan, okay look it wasn't me. I didn't really start the fishstick thing, alriight?
Kanye
You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared.
Mencia
No man it's truuue. I stole it maaan. I took credit for it 'cause I'm not actually funneee. Come on, maaan, do you know what it's like? Being a comedian but not being funneee? Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent, maaan.
Kanye
Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!
Mencia
Nothing! Look at me maaan. I'm not funny, I steal jokes, my dick don't work maaan. I got to piss in a plastic bag, man, I got no dick.
Kanye
I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.
Mencia
Awww shih oh no man, come on, I got no dick, man! [Kanye's men whip out their own back and start whacking Mencia all over. His right hand gets broken, his left shin bleeds. The men stop as Kanye approaches him]
Kanye
[in Mencia's face] Now, explain it to me. Why do people think I'm a gay fish?
Mencia
'Cause... 'cause you like fish dicks, man. Come on, maaan. Don't you get it? Please, just get it, maaan.
Kanye
Why- Look at me, look at me! [Mencia manages to look at him] I love fishsticks. I love putting fishsticks in my mouth. [waits a while for an answer]
Mencia
You're a- ...you're a gay fish, maaan. [Kanye backs up, swings at Mencia and decapitates him, leaving his head hanging from his body by some skin]
Ellen.
Ellen DeGeneres
Thank you, thank you very much. Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. And ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it. [the audience laughs] But today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer. [Cartman and Jimmy go onstage and sit on the couch facing Ellen] Hey guys!
Cartman
Hi Ellen. [to the audience] Do you guys like fishsticks? [the audience laughs] Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
Ellen
So guys, I gotta ask: how did you come up with this incredible joke?
Jimmy
It was just a-
Cartman
Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
Ellen
But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?
Jimmy
Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-
Cartman
Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. [the audience applauds and cheers]
Ellen
That's so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?
Jimmy
Yes Ma'am. [the best and worst of times for him]
Cartman
Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
Ellen
I see. And did you know that Carlos Mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole? [Jimmy and Cartman are alarmed]
Cartman
Uhhh excuse me? [the crowd gets rowdy.]
Kanye's mansion. He was looking at the show with bat in hand...
Kanye
Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play. [walks up to the wall-mounted TV and smashes it with the bat.]
Jimmy's house, day, Jimmy's room. Cartman and Jimmy enter, with Jimmy still distraught.
Cartman
Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
Jimmy
It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
Cartman
Yeah, that was kewl huh?
Jimmy
Eric, there's something I really need to know.
Cartman
Whassat?
Jimmy
How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke. [Cartman gets worried] But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
Cartman
So... here it is.
Jimmy
How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
Cartman
That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did! [Kanye kicks the bedroom door open and enters the room. His men pour in and start smashing the furniture apart] Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
Kanye
Tie up these motherfuckers! [cut to the next scene, in which Kanye swings at a lamp and shatters it, then looks at his hostages] Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?!
Jimmy
Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.
Kanye
Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started!
Jimmy
Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
Cartman
Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
Jimmy
Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-
Cartman
Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
The fourth recollection. Cartman enters Jimmy's house in a rather nice outfit and sunglasses.
Cartman
Hello Jim.
Jimmy
Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!
Cartman
[moves the glasses back over his cap] What are you up to?
Jimmy
I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
Cartman
Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. [goes for a chair]
Jimmy
Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. [hands his joke sheet to Cartman as Cartman brings the chair over and sits next to him]
Cartman
Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
Sarah
[brings in a plate of potato chips] Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat.
Cartman
Thanks. [Sarah walks away] So, what I'm thinking is, "Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?" [something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look around.]
Jimmy
What was that? [Butters opens the door and steps in]
Butters
Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! [outside, everyone scatters as robots march down the street firing off semiautomatic weapons. Cartman runs out to see what's happening. Butters and Jimmy follow right behind. Officer Barbrady and Mayor McDaniels look on helplessly]
Cartman
Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here? [takes off his glasses] Flame on! [becomes engulfed in flames and flies into the air. He then sends streams of flames at the robots, destroying them instantly. He flies back down to his starting point] Flame off! [the flames disappear. Other fourth graders appear: Annie, Millie, Red, Clyde, Token and Wendy]
Wendy
You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.
Cartman
Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke! [runs in and finishes the joke in a flourish. Jimmy walks in] "Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?" There! [other kids look in]
Jimmy
Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!
Back to the present.
Cartman
Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
Jimmy
What?!
Cartman
You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
Jimmy
Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?
Cartman
Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
Kanye
What? I, I still don't get anything.
Cartman
All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
Jimmy
Rih, r-r-really?
Cartman
I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are. [Kanye looks as if Cartman is talking about him] Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.
Jimmy
Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding.
Kanye
He's right. For so long I've considered myself God's gift to the world that I couldn't take it when people made fun of me. But they weren't makin' fun of me. They were tryin' to help me. [walks up to the boys and genuflects before them] Boys I understand what you did now. [to his men] Untie them guys. I know what I have to do.
The Santa Monica Pier, furthest point from land. Kanye stands at the edge of the pier ready to jump in.
Aide 2
Yo Kanye! You sure about this?
Kanye
It's time for me to stop runnin'. I need to believe what people tell me. [turns and faces his entourage.] Let all my fans know I love 'em, but a gay fish just can't live in the outside world forever. Don't be sad for me guys! [turns around, runs, and dives into the ocean below] I'm goin' home! [his crew looks down into the water as Kanye begins swimming in his new environment]
The waters off Santa Monica Beach. Kanye is swimming among the fish as a song begins...
Kanye
(Uh. Come on.)
I've been so lonely, girl, I've been so sad and down.
Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish...
'Cuz I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a fish, yo)
Going on a gay fish gay fish (it's alright, girl)
Makin' love to other gay fish gay fish (Unh)
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feeling like a whore
 'Cuz I wasn't being true even though everyone said
That I had to make a switch (gay fish)...
Now I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a, I'm a fish, yo)
Going on a gay fish gay fish (Yes, now where I belong, girl)
Making love to other gay fish.

During the song, the following happens: Kanye begins to swim like a fish. He spots a yellow fish and lets it circle him a few times. He then hugs it and takes it to the surface. He then gives it a French kiss, then flips backwards into the water with it. He swims again, alone, when a large fish begins to follow him. He notices, swims to it, and begins to rub against it. Then he just swims with it, hugging its belly.
End of Fishsticks

Pinewood Derby
A close-up of Stan and Randy working on a tiny car. Randy is doing pretty much all the work. They are in the basement.
Randy
Alright, [measures the length of the car's body] that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. [Stan holds on to the car's front end as Randy whips out a cordless drill. Randy bores into the rear end of the car as Sharon comes down the stairs.]
Sharon
Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m.
Randy
[looks over his shoulder] We know!
Sharon
Well it's way past time for bed.
Randy
Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
Sharon
Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
Randy
That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone! [turns his attention to the car again. Sharon goes upstairs] Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. [pulls out a small box]
Stan
Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
Randy
Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year? [opens the box to reveal a small glowing metallic ball, picks it up with some tongs] I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field. [puts the small ball in the hole he just drilled out, then plugs the hole up with a stopper that lines up flush with the car body] There.
Stan
What is that?
Randy
It's, uh it's nothing, really.
Channel 9 News.
Reporter
Tom, I'm standing outside the Hadron particle super-collider in Switzerland, where authorities are shocked and baffled over the theft of a superconducting bending magnet created for use in tests with particle acceleration.
Stan
[watching TV] Oh no, he didn't.
Reporter
The superconducting magnet was stolen sometime last week. Surveillance cameras were able to record the theft on tape and police are now looking for [a picture of Randy dressed as Princess Leia] Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. Caught here in these photos, the troubled rebel princess is seen taking the superconducting magnet and then appearing disoriented as she tries to find her way out. [Stan buries his head into his right palm in shame] If you have any information of Princess Leia's whereabouts, please call your local police department.
Pinewood Derby Colorado State Championship, track area.
Judge
Alright Scouts and Dads, the racing continues. And it looks like our next heat is ready to go, in 3, 2, 1, race! [four boys release their cars. Token and Butters are two of the boys. The cars slide down a ramp and onto the straightaway, and hit a barrier at the other end of the track. Neither Token nor Butters wins] Two point one seconds for Tommy Bretts. Looks like we have a new leader, folks.

[hi-five each other] All right!
Pinewood Derby Colorado State Championship, Registration area. Stan and Randy enter the building.
Randy
Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify. [kneels down next to Stan] Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about "tells."
Stan
Tells?
Randy
When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
Stan
Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
Randy
Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. [rubs his neck and looks up and away. Stan notices and is shocked.]
Official
Looks good. Thank you and good luck today. [the boy and his father leave, Stan and his father step up] Alright, next please. [Stan hands him his car. Randy rubs his neck again, then grins nervously] Name?
Stan
It's uh, Marsh. [the official puts the car on a small stand, then measures and weighs it]
Official
Alright, car weighs in at 15 ounces. Do you hereby swear that you used parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit and only parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit?
Randy
[coaxing Stan through gritted teeth] Yes I do, yes I do.
Stan
[in a resigned voice] Yes I do.
Official
Alright young man, good luck today. [hands the car back to Stan. He and Randy walk away]
Randy
[to himself, pumping both fists] Oh! Yes! [nearby they run into Mr. Hollis and son]
Mr. Hollis
Well well, look son, it's the Marshes.
Randy
Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
Mr. Hollis
No, little Emmett hasn't gone yet. Think they're saving the best for last. [pats Emmett's head and holds up their car] Clocked her in at home at 1.5 seconds. It's the fastest car we've ever built.
Randy
One point five?
Pinewood Derby Colorado State Championship, track area.
Judge
The time to beat is 1.9 seconds. May we please have... Brewster, Marsh, Jarvis, and Hollis. [the boys line up behind the starting gate, their cars in position. Emmett and Stan are next to each other]
Mr. Hollis
Huh, only fitting our boys should be going head to head for their match, hey Marsh? Heh. [sips from a can of Dr Pep-er]
Randy
Come on, Stan, you can do this! [claps enthusiastically]
Judge
Alright, kids, are you ready? Here we go, last race for the state championship in 3, 2, 1, Go! [the boys release their cars and Emmett's car takes the lead.]
Mr. Hollis
You got it Emmett! [Stan's car begins to shimmy and spark, then stretch itself. It soon takes off, blowing hair and papers around. It crashes through the wall and up into the air outside, shearing off a tree limb. It kills a bird on its way up, then buzzes a passenger jet plane. It heads right out into space. Everyone in the competition goes outside and follows the car's trajectory]
Randy
Oh yeah! [jumps around] Oh yeah! [jabs a finger at Hollis] Suck on that, Hollis!
The Channel Nine news graphics appear.
Announcer
This is Nine News at Ten.
Anchorman
A Colorado boy and his father have set a new record at the Pinewood Derby. [a picture of the two winners appears over his left shoulder] Stan and Randy Marsh not only broke a speed record, but actually appear to have bent time and space and discovered warp speed. [Emmett is watching the news on his couch, sad that he lost] A parade was held for the winners earlier today [they're riding on a space shuttle float during the parade], and already offers for commercials and endorsement deals for the father and son appear to be pouring in. [Emmett goes to his father's study and trophy room and watches him]
Emmett
Dad, I just want you to know I still love you. [a gun is cocked and Mr. Hollis kills himself with a gunshot through the head. The head and left arm quickly fall to his desk.] Waaaagh! [begins to hyperventilate] He's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK-
Space. The car has run out of fuel and is now tumbling through space. A tractor beam comes on and freezes it in place, then pulls it towards a large ship.
Stan's house, day. Stan comes in and opens the door. Two agents are at the front door.
Agent Marx
Stan Marsh?
Stan
Yeah?
Agent Clark
I'm Agent Clark [on the left] and this is Agent Marx [on the right. Both men whip out their badges. They are members of the NSA] We'd like to talk to you about your Pinewood Derby car.
Stan
Aw crap, Dad! [the men enter the house and walk past Stan. He closes the door behind them]
Agent Clark
Young man, what we are about to tell you is a matter of national security. Yesterday every country and embassy on Earth was contacted by... an alien life force.
Stan
Alien?
Agent Marx
[they turn around] Apparently the alien came across your Pinewood Derby car and is now headed to our planet.
Stan
What does it want?
Agent Clark
We believe that they intend to welcome us into the Galactic Federation of Planets. They will want to meet the people who discovered warp speed for our species.
Randy
[coming down the stairs with a cup of coffee] Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-? [jumps back when he sees the men] Aw crap! [walks towards them defensively] What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!
Stan
Dad they aren't here for that.
Randy
[lowers his guard and shakes Agent Marx's hand] Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.
Agent Clark
Mr. Marsh, we were just telling your son that thanks to you, we have made first contact with alien life.
Randy
[surprised, softly] What? [looks to his right and says normally] Hey, hey Sharon.
Agent Marx
NASA's confirmed that an alien ship has entered our solar system and it is headed here.
Randy
So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
Sharon
[walks in from the kitchen with her own cup of coffee] What? Oh my God.
Randy
Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?
South Park, evening. The town is gathered around an open space waiting for the aliens to drop down into the city. Channel 9 News and News 4 are waiting to record the event. An orchestra plays in a temporary gazebo, and a banner above it says "WELCOME, GALACTIC FRIENDS." An organizer guides Randy and Stan to a prime spot in the clearing.
Reporter
The world holds its breath as an alien ship prepares to land. Now that our planet has achieved warp speed, we're about to be welcomed into the universal society. All thanks to a father and son who broke the warp barrier using only the parts in this [holds up a packet] Pinewood Derby car kit.
General
Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders. [gives him a cell phone. Randy's now on a conference call]
Randy
Hullo?
Britain
Godspeed, Mr. Marsh.
France
Ze nation of France iz with you.
Japan
Good ruck witha 'harien, Mista Marsh.
China
Prease say herro froma China.
Randy
Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. [A huge shadow falls over South Park as the ship descends. Three metallic feet come out of the bottom of the ship and set themselves on the asphalt, allowing the ship to land softly]
Reporter
Our first encounter with extraterrestrial life is about to happen. Will it be like in Star Trek: First Contact? Or will it be more like Contact, with Jody Foster? [the ship's doors open, a virtual ramp appears, and the alien walks down the ramp to the street.]
Alien
I seek the life forms that made this. [holds up the car Stan launched into space.]
Randy
That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
Alien
Oh yeah? [affects the manners and voice of a 1930's mobster, holds up a ray gun] You're gonna build me another one, see?
Randy
He's got a gun!
Alien
Everyone down on the ground! [everyone gets on the ground with their hands over their heads] Get those hands up! Let me see those hands! Do it now! I mean it! Show me those hands! I'm Baby Fark McGee-zax, the greatest gangster this universe has ever seen, right?!
Townsman
You can't threaten us! [a blast from the alien's gun injures his thigh and he goes down] Ow!
McGee-zax
Who wants it next, huh?! [a shot of the crowd at Times Square] Anyone else on this planet wanna be a hero? [the crowd there covers its head, as do the various world leaders]
Randy
What do you want?
McGee-zax
I'm on the lam. Got the entire Federation of Planets after me. But they ain't gonna catch me, ya got that?! They might have busted my warp drive, but you obviously know how to make 'em! [tosses the car to Randy, who catches it]
New Yorker
Screw this guy! He can't take out all of us! [McGee-zax fires into the air and the New Yorker gets a sparking sting on his right shoulder] Aargh!
McGee-zax
I can kill any mug on this two-bit planet I want! [a shot of McGee-zax from Akihabara, Tokyo. The Japanese cower and react to his image] You build me a new warp drive or you're all gonna get it, see?!
Judge
Fine. He can build you what you want. All he needs is the official Pinewood Derby kit. Right Marsh?
Randy
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan? [under his breath] Oh boy.
The South Park Market parking lot. Stan and Randy attempt to recreate the supersonic car they made earlier. Just as in the basement, Randy is to the left.
Randy
Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
McGee-zax
What's takin' so long?! You're stallin'!
Stephen
Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.
Randy
We're working on it! [McGee-zax begins to pace back and forth behind them]
Stan
[whispering] Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
Randy
[whispering] Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.
Stan
[whispering] Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
Randy
[whispering] Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
McGee-zax
Alright, that does it! [fires off another shot into the sky. A second later Randy gets a call on his cell phone]
Randy
Hello?
Italy
They justa blew up our government building! Ya got to hurry!
Britain
Mr. Marsh, why won't you finish the Pinewood Derby car?!
Randy
Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
Stan
Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.
Randy
[feeling the stress of urgency] Awhuh. [a siren sounds in the distance. In the sky another space ship shows up, with police sirens on it]
McGee-zax
Aw zahts, it's the intergalactic police.
Randy
What?! [McGee-zax pulls out a small remote control from his left front pocket and aims it at his ship. One click and the ship is cloaked in invisibility. McGee-zax then takes Stan captive and backs away holding a gun to Stan's head]
McGee-zax
You'd better get rid of 'em or your whole planet is gonna get it, see?! [goes towards South Park Market] You tell 'em you ain't seen nothin', you got that?! [the sliding doors open and he takes Stan into the store] I ain't goin' to space jail! [the doors close. The police ship lands and two space officers come out and walk down their ramps to the ground. One officer has two mouths, the other just one. Both of them have four eyes and broad shoulders]
Officer 1
'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?
Randy
Uh, no. [pulls at his ear vigorously] We haven't seen anything.
Officer 1
Well, ya think anyone else on your planet might have seen him?
Randy
Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
China
Uh uh no, no, we haven't seen arien.
France
Uh we've seen nothing here in France.
Randy
Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?
Officer 1
He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?
Randy
No, we're sure.
Officer 1
So then... we're the first aliens you've ever seen?
Randy
That's right, yep, you're the first ones.
Officer 1
You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.
Randy
...Uh. That's r-. That's right! [shakes his head in mock surprise] Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!
Officer 1
[hands Randy his translucent shimmering business card] If you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you-
Randy
We will give you a call!
Officer 1
Mathematical semi-tonal is fine. [the space officers go back up their ramps to the ship, the ramps vanish behind them. Two blinking orbs appear above the ship and it takes off.]
The police ship.
Officer 1
Huh.
Officer 2
[uses both mouths] Something wrong, sir?
Officer 1
I don't know, Davert. Just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right. [blinks]
Back on the parking lot, Randy gives Stan the car body.
Randy
Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.
McGee-zax
I don't need it painted, I just need it functional, all right?! [waves the gun around]
Randy
Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
Judge
That's true.
McGee-zax
I swear, if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for!
Stan
Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
Randy
No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
Stan
[alarmed] Kill the alien?
Randy
Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
Stan
No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
McGee-zax
What are you two whispering about, riiight?
Randy
Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
Stan
Dad? [McGee-zax comes in for a closer look]
Randy
Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here. [McGee-zax studies the axles, and Stan jabs him in the neck with the shank, making him bleed and vomit profusely and then die] Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!
The general takes the remote from McGee-zax's corpse and removes the cloak from the ship with it.
General
Alright men, check the ship. [he and a bunch of lab techs board the ship and look around]
Randy
[kneels by Stan] You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
Stan
I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
Randy
But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.
General
Hey Marsh, get in here! [Randy gets up and goes up the ramp into the ship. Stan follows.]
Inside the ship. The general, lab techs, and a few townsfolk are inside now. Stan and Randy make their way through the group.
Stephen
Can you believe it?
Randy
Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. [Before them is a towering pile of glittering blue bills]
General
Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.
Randy
Right. [takes out his phone but has second thoughts.] Or what if we didn't call the cops?
Stephen
Huh?
Randy
Well I mean... [walks up to the pile] this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.
Stan
No, Dad-
Mr. Garrison
He's right. We don't have to call the police back.
General
All right, let's get the cash put into boxes! [the men get to work]
Outside the ship. Randy is pleased with himself as he goes down the ramp. Stan follows him out.
Stan
Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?
Randy
Will you relax, Stan? [his phone rings and he answers it]
Japan
Don't think you can keep the all the space cash for yourself!
Germany
That's right! This is all of our planet; the space cash belongs to all of us!
Australia
Either America shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops!
Randy
Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around! [hangs up on the leaders] Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! [the general and other federal agents take the space cash away in boxes as Randy grins]
Four days later, in front of the fugitive ship. Randy is on his cell phone negotiating with the other world leaders.
Randy
Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else! [A siren is heard. Randy looks up to the sky and sees the space cops returning, but forgets to cloak the ship] Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on. [the police ship lands and the alien officers exit their ship] Ah hey, space officers.
Officer 1
Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.
Randy
Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
Officer 1
And so, did you find the missing space cash?
Randy
[thinks a moment] Nnno. Space cash? No. [strokes his ear, then rubs his neck with his left hand] There wasn't any space cash.
Officer 2
Well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is?
Randy
Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
Russia
No space cash.
Japan
No we haven't-
Britain
No space cash.
Brazil
No.
Randy
Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
Officer 1
Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.
Randy
[relieved] Probably.
Officer 1
Well you folks all take care now. [the officers turn to leave, but they turn around once again] Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days.
Randy
[silent for a moment] Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
Officer 1
Uh huh. Have a good day. [the officers turn and head up the ramps. The doors close and the police ship leaves the planet once again]
Randy
[gets back on the phone] Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet! [a shot of the Mexican president at his desk with a new water park right outside his window] What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
Stan's room, later. Stan sits on his bed and holds his trophy, but he's not happy about it. He looks at it for a long while, then gets off his bed, walks over to his toy box, and puts the trophy on the lid. He puts his hands behind his back and holds one wrist with the other hand. He then looks at newspaper clippings from the day of the race. The headlines are as follows: "FATHER AND SON SET PINEWOOD DERBY RECORD", "WARP SPEED DISCOVERED", "DAD AND SON GREET VISITORS FROM OTHER WORLD!", "DERBY WINNER KILLS ALIEN," "CHINA BUILDS 48 NEW SOCCER STADIUMS." Stan sighs silently, sadly.
The Marsh house, kitchen. Randy is back on the phone with the world leaders, but he's getting disheveled.
Randy
No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
Japan
Well then why can Engrand build a nuclear power plant?!
Randy
Nobody can build anything!!
Britain
Yeah, well, it's not even gonna matter, because Finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth!
Randy
Wha?! Finland?! [Stan walks by the kitchen to see what's going on]
Finland
We believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did. It's best we come clean now.
Randy
[getting exasperated] Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
Finland
I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved. We cannot live with the guilt anymore.
Randy
Okay okay! [Stan leaves] You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
Finland
Very well. [goes on hold]
Randy
All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
China
Yep, we gotta take out Finrand, they gonna squeal.
Australia
Yeah, I think we all agree. Guys? [eight leaders are shown onscreen and they all agree]
Outer space. Missiles from around the world begin to flow towards Finland and bomb the place.
The Marsh house, night. The family is having a nice quiet dinner when the police ship returns to South Park. Randy wipes his mouth dry and leaves the table.
Randy
Oh dammit!
The landing area. A crowd gathers again and Randy walks up to the ship.
Randy
Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
Officer 1
Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?
Randy
[rubs his neck again] Whaa-wha-what about it?
Officer 2
It appears to have been... destroyed.
Randy
[feigning surprise] Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.
Crowd
Oh no, not Finland.
Randy
Hey guys, Finland's dead.
Russia
Oh no. No! Nooo.
Japan
Noo, not a Finrand!
Kenya
All of Finland, gone.
Randy
Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
Officer 1
None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?
Randy
[rubs his neck again] No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.
Officer 2
We didn't say anything about nukes.
Randy
Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.
Stan
'Scuse me! 'Scuse me! [the crowd makes way for him as he walks up to the ship] Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! [hands it to the judge]
Judge
[takes the trophy] What?
Randy
Stan?
Stan
The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. [the crowd reacts to this admission.]
Japan
Not in the approved kit?!
Australia
He cheated on the Pinewood Derby?
Stan
This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. [everyone, including the world leaders from Kenya and South Korea, hangs on Stan's every word]
Randy
Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
Officer 1
Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?
Randy
[gets on the phone with the other leaders] Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?
Britain
Nope.
France
Nope.
South Korea
No changes.
Kenya
Nope.
Russia
No changes.
Brazil
Nope.
China
No. Tell them no.
Australia
No changes.
Randy
[rubs his neck] Yeah, no, we've told you everything, space officers.
Officer 1
All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over. [a door on the lower level of the ship drops down from the outer wall to become a ramp, and a figure stands at the entrance, then walks down the ramp. The figure looks familiar...]
Randy
[jumps back in horror] Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!
McGee-zax
My real name is Kevern Zaksor. I am the ambassador to new planet testing. [Stan and Randy look at each other]
Britain
What the hell are they talking about?
Kevern Zaksor
These are not space cops. [the officers remove their helmets] There is no space jail, and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth. I mean, how stupid is your species? Space jail? Baby Fark McGee-zax?
Randy
It was... a trick?
Officer 2
Whenever a civilization discovers warp speed, we want to bring them into the Federation of Planets, but first we do the space cash test, to see if that species is worthy of joining.
Kevern Zaksor
Needless to say, you all failed. [he and the two officers go back inside the ship. He turns at his door's entrance and clears his throat] People of earth, since you did not return the space cash, your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe. Goodbye. [his door closes. The ramps all go back into the ship and the ship takes off]
Randy
No heywaitwait, no! [the ship zooms away from the planet and leaves behind two probes that evolve into a cube of energy shields] Well that sucks!
End of Pinewood Derby

Fatbeard
South Park Elementary Cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are seated at a table and Cartman runs up to them with a map.
Cartman
You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
Butters
We can?
Stan
What are you talking about, dude?
Cartman
Haven't you assholes been watching the news? [rolls the map flat on the table] Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here: [points to the circled nation on the map] Somalia.
Clyde
Somalia? Where's that?
Cartman
North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
Butters
[in thrall] Whoa.
Cartman
I've worked it all out on Expedia. [traces the route from Denver to Somalia] We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
Kyle
Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
Cartman
Right, and wi- [stops] Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
Kyle
No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
Cartman
Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
Kyle
Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
Cartman
Then why don't you wanna go?
Kyle
Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
Kyle, Cartman
Jews can't be pirates.
Cartman
That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle. [rolls up the map] Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! [walks away]
Kyle
[puts his hands together and prays] Please. Please let him go.
South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. The students are in their seats. Three notes play over the PA system.
Gordon Stoltski
Good morning, students. These are the morning announcements. Teacher-parent conferences have been rescheduled to next Tuesday. [Mr. Garrison reads during the announcements] Please inform your parents. The gym is being repainted, and is closed until tomorrow afternoon. And now for a special announcement:
Cartman
Avast there, mateys! [the class looks up at the speaker] Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life? [a shot of some kids in the hall, including sixth graders] Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time? [a shot of the kindergarten class, and its teacher] Then join Captain Cartman's Perfect Pirate Club, arrrr! [back to Mr. Garrison's class] Just imagine it, me hearties! A life without rules, without homework and chores! You can live the pirate's life in Somalia, me friends! [Kyle looks at the blackboard, his eyes half-closed. Stan begins to write stuff down] Even Kyle said so. [Kyle buries his face into his desk] Our first official pirate mee'in will be 4 pm today at Kevin Stoley's house!
Kevin
At my house? Why my house?
Cartman
There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!
Gordon
And for lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving taco salad or hoagie sandwiches. Thank you.
Kevin Stoley's house, basement, just past 4. Butters is leading the meeting, as Cartman hasn't arrived yet.
Butters
Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates. [only four kids showed up - Kevin, Ike, Clyde, and Gordon Stoltski] Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! [blows into a whistle. To his left, by the stairs, is a door with a sign, "Captain" on it. Cartman enters the room though that door.]
Cartman
Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh... [sees Gordon Stoltski, then goes into a low voice] Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?
Clyde
Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.
Cartman
But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
Gordon
Fine, I don't wanna be a pirate anyways! [leaves his seat and goes out the stairs and out of the basement]
Cartman
Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
Butters
Yeah!
Cartman
We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
Clyde
And your mom is okay with that?
Cartman
Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
Butters
Neato!
Cartman
Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! [holds up a jeweled sword]
Butters
Pirates ho! [holds up his own small sword. The others follow suit with daggers]
Clyde, Ike
Pirates ho!
Kevin
Ho! [his sword is a lightsaber. Cartman looks at it in disbelief]
Cartman
Kevin, Goddammit! [Kevin turns off the lightsaber's light]
Montage. A passenger jet flies out of Denver International.
Clerk
Have a good flight. Next, please? [Cartman approaches with his crew. He hands the clerk his payment]
Cartman
We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!
Clerk
[slowly] I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?
Cartman
That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
Butters
[has second thoughts and turns around] Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
Cartman
What?!
Butters
It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
Clyde
Yeah maybe we should think about this.
Cartman
You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
Butters
Huh, who, you mean you?
Cartman
Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
Butters
No, I'm sick of it!
Cartman
Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
Butters
He's right, lads. To adventure!
The flight path is shown. It follows the path Cartman traced on the map. Butters is giddy looking out the window. As the plane crosses the Atlantic the boys play in their seats. Once the plane reaches Cairo, the boys transfer onto a bus and go south across Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, and finally Somalia, ending in Mogadishu. A shot of the city from the air, looking east. The bus stops and everyone gets off. The road underneath it is dusty. The boys walk away from the bus, then it rolls off. They can't believe what they see.
Clyde
This is Somalia?
Butters
Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
Cartman
The FUCK?! [some Somalis notice them and stop to look] 'Scuse me, where are the pirates? [stops a man walking by] Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh! [the man ignores him and keeps on walking.] Butters, get the phrase book out. [Butters approaches with the phrase book in hand] Ask these people where the pirates are.
Butters
Uhh, [mumbles a bit] mahjey burazi?
Somali 1
Burad. Iyaja dene zaredeko.
Somali 2
Buradi wakuwasa.
Butters
Oh. He-he says they're in there. [points to his left. A mustard-colored building is being defended by two guards.]
Cartman
Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! [the boys turn and walk towards the building]
Somali 2
Mayasuk! Hageha-aden! Letka suwahater! [Translation: "No! wait! Don't go in there! Those people are dangerous!"]
Cartman
Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. [dismissing the warning, he and his crew continue on to the building.]
The pirates' lair. They go about their business until they notice the boys enter. Cartman walks on into the middle of the lair.
Cartman
Avast! [no one else says a word. In a low voice, he says] These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.
The following is taken from the episode, as they are English subtitles.
Pirate 1
"Is this some kind of joke?"
Pirate 2
"I don't know what the fuck this is!"
Cartman
I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with.
Pirate 1
"These white children will bring a high price in ransom money!"
Pirate 2
"Take them out to the nearest European boat! Show them we have children hostages!" [surrounding pirates stand up with their rifles]
Cartman
Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
The pirates' bay. Several pirates walk the boys down the dock.
Pirate 3
[wearing a #13 jersey] "Move it! Go over that way!"
Pirate 4
[wearing a mustard-colored shirt] "We will get a nice ransom for you!" [the fifth pirate wears a black shirt]
Cartman
Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. [they all stop next to a small boat]
Pirate 3
"Get on board!"
Pirate 4
"Do it now!" [the boys turn to see the boat the pirates want them on]
Cartman
This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
Pirate 3
"Get on the boat now!"
Pirate 4
"Move!"
Cartman
Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
Kevin
I gotta sit middle 'cause I get motion sickness. [the other boys climb in and all four end up on the same row]
Cartman
Kevin, Jesus Christ! [a pirate starts the motor and the boat moves forward] Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah! [Clyde begins to cry] Clyde, the fuck?!
Clyde
You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! [continues crying]
Cartman
Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!
Clyde
No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
Cartman
Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please? [Ike looks at Clyde and smacks him. Clyde stops crying] Very nice, Ike. [looks ahead] All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! [before them is a French cruise ship]
The French cruise ship, day.
French Captain
"Keep your eyes open, Mr. Leon. These waters are full of renegades and thieves."
Mr. Leon
[ship's navigator] "Yes, Captain!" [an alarm sounds and the captain leaves the bridge to find out what's going on.]
Deck Hand
[sees the captain and approaches] "Captain! We have an unknown vessel approaching quickly to port!"
French Captain
"Damn pirates! Alert the crew! All hands on deck!" [the little boat pulls up next to the cruise ship. The captain and his crew gather in front of the bridge and the captain looks at the pirates through his binoculars]
Pirate 5
[through a bullhorn] "We demand ransom for these children! Pay us or we will kill them!"
French Captain
"They've got CHILDREN HOSTAGES!"
Cruise Attendant
"My God!"
French Captain
"Get the U.N. on the radio. Advise them of the situation."
Pirate 5
"We want 5,000 Euros! You easily have that much on board!"
Cartman
Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this. [takes the bullhorn from him] Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!
Pirate 4
[moves over to Cartman and aims his rifle at him] "We are going to start killing them! Starting with the fat one!"
Cartman
Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
Butters
ARRRRRRGH!
Kyle's house, day. Kyle is looking mighty relaxed now that Cartman is gone. He's in the living room talking on the phone with Stan.
Kyle
Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
Stan
[in the kitchen at his house] No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
Kyle
Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
Stan
You really think he'll die in Somalia?
Kyle
[chuckles] Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
Sheila
[voice only, but soon comes down the stairs with Gerald behind her] Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! [She has a letter in her hand. Kyle's happiness vanishes]
Gerald
Take it easy. We'll find him.
Kyle
I'll call you back. [hangs up. Sheila approaches him.]
Sheila
Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!
Kyle
What? Are you sure?
Sheila
He left a note saying he's never coming back.
Kyle
[takes the note and reads it aloud] "Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
Sheila
Oh Gerald, what are we gonna do?
Gerald
It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. [leaves with Sheila and the phone]
Kyle
Oh God. What have I done?
The French cruise ship, day.
Pirate 4
"We are growing impatient! Give us what we want or they die!"
Cartman
The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
French Captain
"Alright! Alright! We are going to give you what you want! But you must hand over the children UNHARMED!"
Pirate 5
"The money first!" [a crewman throws down a bag of money to the small boat and one of the pirates catches it and opens it. A rope ladder is unforled so the boys could climb up to the cruise ship] "Go! Get on the boat! Move!"
Cartman
Alright, let's go! [the boys go up the ladder and board the ship]
Cruise Attendant
"We got 'em - They're safe!" [the pirate boat turns and zooms away]
French Captain
[to the pirates] "Your crimes will not go unpunished!" [turns and faces the kids] "Are you kids alright?"
Cruise Attendant
"Did they hurt you?"
Cartman
Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!
French Captain
"What is this?!"
Cartman
Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
Butters
Okay! [runs off to plunder]
Cartman
I said, get off my boat!
French Captain
"Hey! You can't order us around!" [Kevin walks up with his lightsaber and turns it on. The captain and crew jump back. Kevin waves it around, Cartman rolls his eyes to the right, and the captain and crew move in that direction. They all head to a lifeboat, with the captain and crew going "Qu'est-ce que passe? Mon Dieu!"]
Cartman
That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs! [the captain and crew get on the lifeboat] Lower 'em down, Ike. [Ike lowers the lifeboat to the ocean]
French Captain
"Scoundrels! You will pay for this!"
Butters
Have a good day! [the lifeboat is safely on the water. Cartman quickly begins to make changes. The French flag comes down and the skull and bones one goes up. Cartman walks up to the the ship's bow]
Cartman
Hard to port, lads!
Clyde
[relaying the message] Hard to port!
Butters
[at the wheel. Ike stands on a stool next to him] What's "port"?!
Cartman
Just make the boat go that way, kind of. [the ship ends up turning towards shore, towards the pirates' lair. The pirates have just finished tying up their boat when they stop and look towards the sea. The ship's horn blows and the ship heads towards the dock] That's good. Now bring her around topside. [the cruise ship pulls up alongside the pier and lowers the rope ladder. The boys get off the ship and head back to the lair. Cartman stops for a moment and points it out to the pirates] Now that's a pirate ship! [the boys head into the pirates' lair] A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves? [starts tossing wads of cash at pirates] Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around. [walks to an open table and has the boys sit there] A round of grog for me boys! [a pirate brings drinks to the table and passes them out] A round of grog for everyone! [the pirate leaves] The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys! What kind of pirates are you?! Look at yourselves! You disgrace the Blackbeard! I don't know where you people get off calling yourselves pirates! [gets up and walks around] Little beat-up boats, water in Dixie cups. I mean, I mean look, look at this guy! [the pirate he's looking at has lost his left leg from the knee down] Look at this guy for Christ's sake! [rips a leg from a chair and ties it up the pirate's left leg] I mean, how hard is this, people?! [the pirate grins and hobbles away with his new peg leg. Cartman walks back to the boys' table, then stands on it] I tell you lads, if we're gonna be the most feared people on Earth, then there needs to be some Goddamned changes around here!
Weee drink and we pillage and we do what we please! We get all that we want for free!

Cartman, Butters
We'll kick your ass and rape your lass. Somalian pirates we!
So with a yo ho ho!
[No one says a thing]

Cartman
[sighs] Goddamnit people!
With a yo ho ho!

Pirates
Yo ho ho.
Cartman
And with a yee hee hee!

Pirates
Yee hee hee.
Cartman
We take to the African sea!
We'll brave the squalls and bust your balls
Somalian pirates we!

Pirates
Somalian pirates we.
Butters mops the deck with the pirates. Cartman leads other pirates off the ship with fresh booty. Other pirates build up a sand sculpture of a giant skull. Next, they paint "Beware!" on the cruise ship. Butters walks up to Ike, who puts a tri-corner hat on a Somali pirate. Nearby, pirates carry barrels of "ALE" between them.
Together
We left our homes and we left our mudders
to go on a pillagin' spree!
We'll cut off your ears and break your toes
and make you drink our pee!
And if you sail into our waters,
you best hear this decree:
We'll take your boat, set your ass afloat!

One of the barrels has another pirate in it.
Pirate
Somalian pirate we.

Cartman
Nice.
And with a yo ho ho!

A shot of the sand sculpture.
Pirates
Yo ho ho!

A shot Clyde and Kevin raising the flag on the flagpole, then of Cartman nailing down the lair's new name: Skull Cove.
Cartman
And a tricky lahty do!

Pirates
Tricky lahty do!

Cartman makes a choir out of the pirates and conducts them.
Cartman, Choir
We'll shoot you in the face with glee!
Then we'll cut off your ears-

Cartman
Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a "lahty do" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the "lahty" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second "yo ho". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? [Ike is at a spinet piano]
Pirate Choir
Somalian pirates we.

Cartman
Better!
With a yo ho ho!

Cartman looks out over the cove with a telescope from the crow's nest. The cruise ship, now called "The Black Diamond," pulls up along another French ship and force its crew to surrender. Cartman pours water over a lazy crocodile.
Choir
Yo ho ho!

Cartman
And a tricky lahty do!

Choir
Tricky lahty do!

Cartman, Choir
We'll shoot you in the face with glee!
Then we'll cut off your cock and feed it to a croc.

Ike
Somalian pirates we.
Ike sets off a coconut cannonball, but the coconut simply falls out. Next is the big finish, with everyone gathered around Cartman on the beach.
Pirate Choir
Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.

Cartman
Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.

Off shore is a tanker called "Paolo." The French crew is now on board with cups of water and draped in blankets, and the tanker's captain is on the phone with the U.N.
Paolo Captain
We found them adrift in a lifeboat, sir. They say that pirates took their ship by force.
U.N. Leader
Damn pirates! What's causing them to suddenly be so much more active? Is the crew okay?
Paolo Captain
Yes sir. They're French, so they surrendered immediately. [addresses the crew] Once the pirates boarded your ship how did they force you off?
French Captain
Il a vert lightsabeur.
Cruise Attendant
Oui. Un lightsabeur.
Deck Hand
Le lightsabeur terrible. [does lightsaber sound effects, then sobs.]
Paolo Captain
Sir, the pirates appear to have forced the French crew off their boat with a lightsaber.
U.N. Leader
My God, pirates are getting better-equipped every day! Gentlemen, I want the President of the United States on the phone. We can no longer fight the pirates on the seas. We have to take them out where they live.
Skull Cove, later. Cartman enjoys a drink from a coconut shell.
Cartman
What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh? [a shot is heard, followed by commotion from the pirates. Cartman and the boys walk over to a crowd of pirates gathered around something] What's going on?
Pirate 6
"We have a hostage!"
Pirate 7
"Another American arrived on the bus!"
Cartman
Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom. [the crowd splits in two and Kyle is shown. Kyle is tied up so he can't use his arms. Ike looks happy to see Kyle.] Well well well well well!
A news flash.
Announcer
This is CNN... N.
Anchorman
Breaking news of yet another pirate crisis in Somalia. Members of NATO received word today that pirates have captured an American child and are demanding ten million Euros for his safe release. U.S Navy ships have been deployed and the pirate standoff is about to get ugly.
Skull Cove, later. Cartman paces back and forth with confidence.
Cartman
Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
Kyle
No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
Cartman
"It isn't safe." That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was "awesome."
Kyle
I know! I was lying then!
Cartman
Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
Kyle
This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive! [a fish walks out of the water on hind legs, squawks, turn around and goes back into the ocean] Cartman, just give me my brother [Cartman turns around and faces Kyle] and let us get out of here!
Cartman
Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.
Inside the pirates' lair, Butters and Ike stock a French tool box. Butters announces the items and hands them to Ike.
Butters
One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
Pirate 4
[walks up to the two boys] Ey excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
Butters
Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.
Galeed
Why did you Americans come here?
Butters
Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
Ike
Yeah, homework.
Butters
And our parents hollered at us!
Ike
Yeah.
Butters
So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
Ike
Piewets!
Galeed
But that's what I do not understand. Why would anyone "want" to be a pirate?
Butters
Huh?
Galeed
Every day I dream that I can go to school. Learn about the world. But my mother, she is dyin' of AIDS, and there is no money for medicine. My father was killed trying to find food for us. Do you know how I feel every time we try to capture a boat? Scared. And not just scared because I might get killed, but scared because if I don't get something out of it, my family and friends are going to die. I don't want to be a pirate. I don't see how anybody would. [turns and quickly runs out of the lair.]
Ike
Oh my God. [rests his head against a chair]
Butters
Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
Ike
I feel, like an asshole.
Butters
Yeah, me too.
Outside on the cove, Cartman has Kyle on the makeshift plank above the crocodile.
Cartman
Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!
Kyle
Cartman, knock it off!
Cartman
That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!
Pirate 6
"Do you think all American kids are as crazy as these are?"
Pirate 8
"It's starting to look that way."
Butters
[runs up to Eric with Ike in tow] Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
Cartman
What?!
Butters
Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. [Clyde begins to cry again]
Cartman
Clyde!
Clyde
I hate it here and I wanna go home!! [begins to bawl]
Cartman
[threatens the other three boys with his sword; they back down] You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!
Kyle
They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
Cartman
Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit! [whistles] To arms! [the real pirates gather around and aim their rifles at the boys] Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an entire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
Pirate 5
"Hey, what's that?" [in the distance a U.S. ship gets into position]
Commander
Alright men, remember, do not hit the white ones!
Cartman
Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! [a volley of bullets takes down all the pirates, leaving the six boys unharmed. The boys look at the carnage around them]
Sniper
[several seconds later] Clear.
Cartman
The FUCK?!
End of Fatbeard

Dead Celebrities
The Broflovski house, night.
Gerald
[voice over] You have been very very naughty! [a shot of Kyle's parents having sex in bed] You're a naughty girl! [begins to grunt with every thrust]
Sheila
Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty! [joins in the grunting for a few seconds] Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! [their bedroom door opens]
Gerald
[quickly turns around and faces the door] What the?! ...Ike! [Ike is at the bedroom entrance looking scared. He's dragging a puppy plushie around] Ike, get back to bed right now!
Ike
I'm scared. There's a ghost.
Gerald
Uh, not this again. [angrily] Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!
Ike
But Daddy I saw the-
Gerald
No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! [Ike turns left and walks out of view, his head hanging]
Sheila
Gerald, what has gotten into him?
Gerald
[sighing] Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he just freaked himself out.
Ike's room, moments later. The moon fills the room with dim light and a tree outside the window casts a moving shadow onto Ike's bed. Ike sits in his bed nervously. He looks outside the window, and the tree's branches rap at his window in the high wind. Ike looks around and shuts his eyes. His mobile playset begins to turn slowly. A loud sound wakes Ike and then he gasps. A ghost makes its way towards the window from outside, passes through it slowly, then lunges at him. As soon as the ghost is at the foot of the bed, it becomes recognizable as Billy Mays, the late TV pitchman.
Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here for Megascrub Cleanser.
Ike
AAAAAAAAA!
Billy Mays
Are you tired of your kitchen counters getting those nasty stains? Don't just rub 'em, Megascrub 'em!
Ike
Billy Mays, NO! [jumps out of bed and runs into his closet. The camera pans out...]
Billy Mays
[...and Billy is in the closet too] Mold, mildew, even those impossible wine stains are gone in a flash when you snipe them away.
Ike
[runs out of the closet, through his room, and into the hallway.] MMOOMMMYYY! [runs towards the stairs and passes another room. Another celebrity appears in the entrance] AAAAAA! Farrah Fawcett! Farrah Fawcett! [runs to a door opposite the room and opens it. A man appears hanging from the ceiling in that room, wearing fishnet stockings] AAAAAA! David Carradine! [runs away from that room and heads for the stairs, but stops in his tracks and gasps]
Billy Mays
[walking up the stairs] Hi, Billy Mays here for Mighty Mend It, the fast and easy way to mend, hem, and wear it again. [Ike backs away towards his room]
Ike
NOOOOO!
Kyle
[comes out of his room] Ike! Ike, what?!
Ike
Make Billy Mays go away! Make Billy Mays go away! [Kyle looks, but nothing is there] Make him stop! [buries his face in Kyle's shoulder. Kyle consoles him] Make him stop, Kyle!
The office of one D. Land, Ph. D., Psychiatrist, day. Inside, the psychiatrist has Ike on a couch and is trying to get him to open up.
Dr. Land
Now Ike, your family is very worried about you. Ike, you can talk to me. I'm a therapist. Whatever has been troubling you, it's okay.
Ike
No, it's... it's a secret.
Dr. Land
Ike, tell me your secret. I promise not to tell anyone else.
Ike
[turns his head to the right to look at the doctor] I see dead... ce-le-bri-ties.
Dr. Land
You mean, you see dead celebrities on TV? In the news?
Ike
I see them walking around. They talk to me.
Dr. Land
Are you seeing any dead celebrities right now?
Ike
Just Ed McMahon. [Ed McMahon's ghost looks at Ike over Dr. Land's right shoulder, then turns right and walks off]
Dr. Land
How often do you see dead celebrities?
Ike
All the time. [blinks a few times]
Cartman's house, day. Cartman has the remote control and is flipping through channels.
Cartman
'Sup, Jew?
Kyle
Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
Cartman
HA! What a dumbass!
Kenny
(What do you think is wrong with him?)
Kyle
I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name "Billy Mays" over and over again.
Cartman
Billy Mays? Billy Mays?! [hops off the sofa] Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
Stan
Dude, I don't even know who that is.
Cartman
The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here! [quickly flips through the channels until a Billy Mays commercial appears] Here here! This, this is him!
Commercial. Mays is in a laundry room.
Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product. If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle [shows off two Chipotle burritos], but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear. [shows off bloodstained underwear]
Man 1
[holding a burrito in his right hand] I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. [a shriek is added for emphasis]
Billy Mays
[now near a washer and dryer] Well now there's a product that can clean even bloodstains caused by Chipotle right off your underwear. Chipotl-away. [shows off the bottle, which says Chipotlaway. What follows is a demonstration of how the product works] Just one Chipotle burrito [shown] can leave up to a quarter cup of underwear blood [a quarter cup of red liquid is poured onto the briefs], but Chipotl-away [a couple of squirts of it makes the liquid vanish] makes your underwear clean [a towel is used to remove the liquid and product] and ready for more. [a man is shown stocking up on briefs, but they slip from his arms] Stop buying new underwear every time you eat Chipotle. That can cost you thousands. Chipotl-away gets rid of bloodstains and leaves underwear good as new. [a pair of black hands smooths some briefs out over a table, then puts the Chipotle burrito on it] Imagine having underwear so clean you can practically eat off of it.
Man 2
[leans down towards the burrito and smiles at the camera] Mmm, Chipotle. [gives a thumbs up and begins to eat off his underwear]
Billy Mays
Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want [two women eat burritos on a park bench.], and still have underwear that sparkles and shines [one of the women holds up a pair of clean panties, which sparkle and shine]. Order right now!
TV promo.
Cartman
That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
Kyle
What?! Are you serious?!
Cartman
Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
Kyle
Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
Cartman
Because he was a great person, Kyle.
Kyle
NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
Cartman
...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
An episode of Ghost Hunters.
Announcer
On this episode of Ghost Hunters [a cemetery is shown]: a little boy in Colorado appears to be haunted by celebrities. [a shot of Ike floating across the screen, with various backdrops behind him] Now the Ghost Hunter team will roll out and get to the bottom of it. It's the gayest show in the fucking world; Ghost Hunters!
Jason
Alright, tell us what we got this week, Kris.
Kris
We're going to Colorado to investigate celebrity paranorm-
Jason
Wait, what? What was that? What was that?
Grant
I heard it too. It was like a, like a ...*pop*
Jason
Is there a ghost here?
TAPS heads out to South Park in two SUVs.
Jason
Alright, so you say a little boy is seeing the ghosts?
Kris
Yeah, apparently only he is seeing them.
Jason
Doyuh ssh ssh. What, what is that? Do you hear that?! There, there look. What is that? What is that?
Grant
I think that's just a cigarette lighter.
Jason
Oh, right, okay. May be.
TAPS has made it to South Park. They are in the Broflovski house at night, in the dark. No lights are on except for flashlights.
Jason
We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that? What was that?
Kyle
What was what?
Jason
Did you hear that? It was like a... it was like a... dee.. Is there a spooky ghost here?? Uh LOOK. What is that? What is that?? [a shot of the Broflovskis living room TV]
Grant
I'm pretty sure that's their television.
Jason
Oh man I am really scared. [looks at his groin. Grant's flashlight and the camera quickly aim at it] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What is this? What is this? There's a, there's a, a wetness coming from my pants! [he peed his pants]
Grant
I see it!
Jason
W... what is it?!
Grant
Oh God I'm so scared! [begins to whimper] I'm so scared.
Jason
Look! Look, it's got you too! [points to Grant's groin, then says to the cameraman] Are you getting this? Make sure the camera is getting this. Definitely some paranormal activity!
Grant
It's warm, and moist. A warm moist sensation that's moving down my left thigh. [the urine reaches the floor and starts spreading out]
Jason
Look, it's starting to form a, a a pool around the floor now. Are you getting this??
Stan
Are you guys fucking serious?
Jason
Oh God, the paranormal activity is now leaving a, a trail of some kind behind both of us! [such melodrama!]
Grant
Hoh! Something... hot, and and, warm is coming out the back of my pants now. [Well...]
Jason
Oh it smells!
The Broflovski house, outside. The front door opens and the four ghost hunters run out screaming.
TAPS
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
The Broflovski house, inside. The lights are back on. Ike hangs his head and walks off to his left, sighing. He sits down on the bottom steps of the stairs. Kyle follows him and sits next to him.
Kyle
Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
Billy Mays
[his ghost suddenly appears with a new pitch] Hi, Billy Mays here for the Big City Slider Station.
Kyle
It's all just in your head, Ike.
Billy Mays
The fast and easy way to press and cook delicious sliders.
Ike
AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!! [the other boys look at each other]
Children's Hospital of Denver, night. Ike is in a recovery room while the older boys wait in the lobby on red couches.
Kyle
I just... don't understand it.
Stan
It's gonna be alright, Kyle.
Kyle
But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
Cartman
Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
Kyle
But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear. [to Stan] Do you understand this?
Stan
Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
Cartman
Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
Dr. Carroll
Well boys, little Ike is stable, but the celebrity ghosts appear to have sent him into some kind of coma.
Stan
Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?
Dr. Carroll
Well of course there really are ghosts. Haven't you seen that show Ghost Hunters? But I'm a pediatric doctor, so I'm going to hand this off to Dr. Phillips, who specializes in spooky things. [Dr. Phillips, a female, walks in and addresses the boys]
Dr. Phillips
The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it. [Stan and Kyle look at each other as Dr. Carroll walks away] I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory.
Kyle
Purgatory? What's that?
Dr. Phillips
[steps closer to the boys] Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called "purgatory." It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo.
Cartman
[concerned] Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...
Ike's room. Dr. Phillips turns on the various monitors to measure Ike's vital signs... and to call out the ghosts.
Dr. Phillips
I am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child. If any spirit can hear my voice, make your presence known. [the needles on an Ectograph 500 begin to move back and forth, producing some readings]
Billy Mays
[only his voice is heard] Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product.
Cartman
Billy Mays! [makes his way to the front of the group] It's him!
Billy Mays
Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?
Cartman
Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
Walter Cronkite
No! Be quiet, Billy Mays! Somebody is trying to contact us!
Dr. Phillips
To which celebrity am I addressin' now?
Walter Cronkite
This, is Walter Cronkite.
Dr. Phillips
All you celebrities need to know that you have passed on.
Farrah Fawcett
We know that!
DJ AM
Yeah! Of course we know that!
Patrick Swayze
There's only one person here who's not cooperating!
Walter Cronkite
That's right! Now just admit you're dead and sit down!
Michael Jackson
...No, that's ignorant! I'm not dead.
Stan
Uh oh.
Walter Cronkite
You are dead!
Michael Jackson
No, I just have a skin condition.
Dr. Phillips
Boys, quickly! Convince Michael Jackson that he's dead.
Kyle
What?
Dr. Phillips
He's in denial. He's been in denial all his life. Now tell him or you're gonna lose your little brother.
Kyle
Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
Michael Jackson
Nooo, you're being ignorant. I'm alive. And I'm a child. And I'm white.
Kyle
Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here for the Super Sweeper.
The Boys (except Cartman) and Dr. Phillips
Shut up, Billy Mays!
Stan
You're dead, Mr. Jackson!
Michael Jackson
No, that's, that's just ignorant.
Stan
Accept it! [the various machines start convulsing and sparking]
Michael Jackson
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Dr. Phillips
He's in too much denial! [a ball of plasma condenses in front of her and shoves her out a window on the top floor of the hospital.] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [She flies through the air across the street and lands a half block away in the middle of another street. She dies on impact. The boys then gather around Ike and pull the wires off his face]
Kyle
Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please! [Ike's eyes slowly open] Eh there you go. That's good. [Ike looks around] Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
Ike
[with Michael Jackson's voice] Nooo. No, that's ignorant. [the boys' jaws drop] Oh look everyone, I told you I was alive.
Kyle
Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
Ike
Wee, I'm a child! [jumps up] I knew I was a child. See? Come on, let's play! Let's go climb a tree! [jumps off the bed and runs out of the room]
Kenny
(Holy shit, dude!)
Kyle
Come back here! [the boys give chase]
A park across the street from Children's Hospital of Denver, night. Ike runs to a tree in the park and tries to climb it.
Kyle
Hey! Heeey!
Ike
Come on, let's climb the tree! Hee hee!
Stan
Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
Ike
Noo, I'm a little white child. Let's play! [hops off the tree trunk and starts dancing] Hee! Hee hee! [begins to moonwalk] Hee hee hee! [arrives at the swing set and hops on a swing]
Kyle
Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
Cartman
Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
Ike
No, that's ignorant. People are just ignorant and they lie and spread rumors about me. Like, that I'm dead. But if I was dead, how could I do this? [hops off the swing and dances some more] Hoo! Dawdaby daw! Shamon! [Kyle looks at his friends and leads them away out of Ike's earshot]
Kyle
What the hell are we going to do??
Ike
[still dancing] Jou know! Jou know it! Hee hee!
The Plane of Purgatory.
Ed McMahon
Come on, this is ridiculous! How much longer do we have to sit in purgatory?!
Passengers
Come on! Come on! This is ridiculous! Come on!
Flight Attendant
[into an intercom mic] Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. I've been informed that we are going to be delayed at least another 96 hours.
Passengers
AWWWWWWWW!
DJ AM
Yo, you can't just keep people stuck like this, man!
Flight Attendant
We know that you are all excited to cross over to the next plane, but for now you have to stay on this one.
Walter Cronkite
That's it! I have to go to the bathroom!
Flight Attendant
Sir, you have to stay in your seat with your seatbelt fastened!
Walter Cronkite
You've been saying that for three months now! [sits back down]
The four boys are now in Stan's room, and Stan is browsing around for information.
Stan
Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...
Kenny
(No, scroll down some more, scroll down some more.)
Stan
...setting traps for ghosts, no...
Kyle
[still trying to make sense of Cartman's ...problem] Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me: [puts both his hands on the table and spreads his fingers out] the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
Cartman
[rolls his eyes up in thought] Was I alarmed? [closes his eyes] Yes. [opens them and looks at Kyle] I believe I was.
Kyle
So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
Cartman
[correcting him] Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. [Kyle's jaw drops in alarm]
Kyle
Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
Cartman
Yes!
Kyle
And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
Cartman
Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal! [Kyle puts his hands down below the table] People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! [points to Stan]
Stan
Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
Kyle
What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
Cartman
A child... and a female. And white.
Ike
Oh lookie, it's a planet. Hee hee hee.
Stan
So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
Kyle
Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? [Kyle looks at his friends, then down at the floor. His friends look at each other. Yes, Kyle...]
A Holiday Inn, day, at Lynchburg. "Lynchburg Welcomes The Tiny Miss Pageant". Inside, the contestants are being introduced. The stage is small, with two bouquets of flowers with balloons attached, one at each end of the stage.
MC
Hello. First up we have the beautiful Miss Jessica. [Jessica comes out wearing lots of makeup, a big head of hair, and a pink pageant dress. There's a smattering of applause]
Jessica's Mom
[clapping] Alright Jessica! Woohoo! [Jessica stops and shows off to the audience]
MC
Jessica enjoys ridin' her horse Marley and doin' her nails with her sisters. Next, contestant number 26, Miss Brandy. [who comes out in a yellow dress]
Brandy's Mom
Yeah Brandy! Work it girl!
MC
Brandy likes ice cream and playing with her cat Sunshine.
Brandy's Mom
[whispering loudly] Don't forget to blow a kiss to the judges, Brandy. [Brandy dutifully blows a kiss to the judges and grins. A balding judge grabs the kiss with his left hand, then reaches down to his groin with that hand and begins to masturbate. Brandy steps off the stage and walks away]
MC
And now welcome contestant number 27, little Miss Michael Jackson. [Ike walks on stage in a small pink dress and blond wig]
Kyle
Alright, Michael! [Kenny mumbles something]
Cartman
Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
Stan
Yeahhhh!
MC
Michael says she just enjoys being a child. She loves to play and climb trees, and thinks people who don't are ignorant.
Ike
Ignorant.
Cartman
God I hope this works.
Purgatory. The celebrities are still waiting to take off to the next plane.
Billy Mays
Hi, Billy Mays here for the little Country Handy Pillow. Are you tired of sitting in limbo? Lost somewhere between planes of existence? Well now there's a product that can help you-
Walter Cronkite
Will somebody shut his fucking mouth?! I can't take it anymore!
Patrick Swayze
This is bad enough without having to constantly listen to you try and sell your stupid crap, Mays!
Billy Mays
With just two easy steps, I can climb over these seats and kick you right in the fucking balls!
David Carradine
That does it. We are not gonna just sit here anymore! We want some Goddamned answers!
Walter Cronkite
Why isn't anybody telling us anything?!
Pilot
Well ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking.
Walter Cronkite
Well it's about fucking time!
Pilot
Certainly want to uhhh thank you for all your patience. We know that you're eager to uhhhh get going and we will certainly pass on any information uhhhhh as it becomes uhhhhhh more available.
DJ AM
But yo! Yo Michael Jackson isn't even here anymore! He's gone! We should be able to move on now!
Flight Attendant
Yes, but as we all know, Mr. Jackson had a LOT of baggage, and he checked some of that baggage in, so a crew has to go through all the baggage and get his off of purgatory before we can push back from the gate.
Passengers
AWWWWWWWW!
Tiny Miss Pageant, later.
Ike
Did I do good in the swimsuit category? I'm worried that little doodoohead brunette girl was prettier than me.
Stan
[approaching the judges' table] Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
Kylie's Mom
It's more important for my little Kylie. Just look at this face.
Kylie
Mommy, that hurts my cheek implants. [another contestant is dancing onstage in a cheerleading outfit. She finishes her routine on her knees. The male judge on the right is taking pictures while the one on the left is masturbating even harder. The lone female judge is just evaluating as usual]
MC
All right, thank you Miss Cassie. And now for her talent portion, Miss Michael Jackson is gonna sing for us. [Ike steps onto the stage again and sings]
Ike
I'm just a little girl. Hee hee. A dainty little thing.
And I know you all want to be a little white girl like me. Shamohn! Hee hee hee. [begins to moonwalk] Hohhh
[the male judges are masturbating furiously]
Stan
Dude, the two male judges love her.
Kenny
(Yeah.) [the doors fly open and a bunch of police officers stream in...]
An Officer
All right, that's about enough! [...and haul away the male judges. The female judge looks on somewhat bewildered]
Kyle
Aww crap!
Cartman
Hey, what the F?!
Tiny Miss Pageant, later.
MC
All right everyone, the judge will now tally her final scores.
Kyle
We're totally screwed! [Brandy and her mom walk by. Brandy's actually a redhead] They took the two best judges away!
Stan
Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
Heidi's Mom
You'll win for sure, Heidi. You know how much that judge adores you.
Kyle
Aw dude, this is hopeless!
Kenny
(Son of a fucking bitch!)
Cartman
Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge. [a shot of the judge] She's eating Chipotle.
Kyle
[not making the connection] So what?!
Cartman
So maybe she doesn't know. [grabs Kyle by his coat collar] Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.
Lady Judge
Oh yes, it's my favorite fast food. I would eat it every day, except I-... [looks down in embarrassment]
Cartman
Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
Lady Judge
How did you know-... Look, it doesn't matter. [turns her back to him] I'm just gonna have to give it up.
Cartman
What if you didn't have to give it up?
Lady Judge
Excuse me?
Cartman
I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
Tiny Miss Pageant, even later.
MC
And now, it is time to announce our Grand Little Miss. Little Miss Michael Jackson. [Ike looks around gratefully as the audience applauds. The judge and the MC approach him. The judge gives him the crown and the MC gives him the trophy. The boys congratulate him]
Kyle
Yeah!
Cartman
Yeah!
Stan
Woohoo!
Cartman
Alright! [one of the contestants stomps her foot and cries, then walks off stage]
Heidi
[passing by the audience chairs] I'm sorry I didn't win, Mommy. [her mom stops for a moment and slaps her across the face]
Ike
Thank you so much for this award. Of all the awards I've ever won, this one means the most. I feel like... I'm finally at rest. I'm finally at rest! I'm free! [Ike passes out standing up with his mouth open wide and Michael's ghost rises out of him, with a ghostly trophy. The judge and MC notice something and look up. Ike wakes up, shakes his head, and looks at himself. Then, in his regular voice] Holy shit! What the fuck am I wwwearing?
Kyle
Ike! [runs up to him. The other boys follow] Ike, you're back!
Ike
Kyle, what the fuck is going on?
Kyle
It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
Cartman
Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
Back in purgatory, a woman yawns.
Michael Jackson
Wee, I'm free! I'm free! [floats down into his seat]
Farrah Fawcett
Hey he's here! He's here!
Bea Arthur
Oh, finally.
Others
He's here! He's back!
Flight Attendant
All right everyone, it looks like we are all ready to move on. [everyone claps]
Michael Jackson
Did you all see my crown? [the plane finally rises up and away]
Billy Mays
Finally! Finally we can all move on!
Hell. The purgatory plane alights here.
Flight Attendant
All right, everyone, I'd like to be the first to welcome you to the gates of Hell. Unfortunately, Hell is a tow-in gate.
Passengers
AWWWWWWWW!
End of Dead Celebrities

Butters' Bottom Bitch
South Park Elementary, day, recess.
Cartman
Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this. [Cartman and Craig are at a tetherball pole, and Cartman is holding the ball. Around them are a bunch of boys, most of them from the fourth grade] Alright, you ready? Now say "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." Come on, dude, "I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me." [the camera pulls back a bit, and Butters is seen at the top of the tetherball pole, hanging from his briefs.]
Butters
I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me. [Cartman hits the ball and it wraps around the pole, finally hitting Butters on his right temple] Ow.
Cartman
Alright, your turn Craig.
Butters
Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! [Craig grabs the ball]
Cartman
Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
Butters
Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.
Stan
Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
Cartman
Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl. [Craig hits the ball and it wraps around the pole until it hits Butters on the face]
Butters
Uugh!
Kyle
So what?
Butters
So what?! [the ball returns and Craig catches it] So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
Craig
That's right. [steps back and hits the ball again. The ball wraps around the pole and hits Butters on the face again. Cartman laughs]
Clyde
You guys, we got it! [walks up with Token] We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.
Butters
Sellin' kisses?
Clyde
She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
Butters
You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
The boys' bathroom, moments later. Butters is now putting on a tie.
Clyde
[giving advice] So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
Butters
Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
Cartman
Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
Kyle
Butters, I think you should reconsider this.
Butters
Uh, how come?
Kyle
Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
Cartman
Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
Butters
I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
Back in the playground, moments later. Butters is walking to the temp building with a crowd of boys following him at a short distance.
Butters
Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
Francis
Pretty worth it. [walks away with a dreamy look in his eyes]
Jimmy
Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some.
Butters
I'm going! [walks towards the back of the temp building] Ohh... [finds Sally and talks to her nervously] Oh, hi.
Sally
Hey. [punches something into her cell phone and puts it away in her back pocket]
Butters
So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
Sally
Okay, cool.
Butters
Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. [puckers up and steps closer to Sally]
Sally
So you got money?
Butters
Oh, money... Rrright. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out a five dollar bill, then hands it to her] There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. [smiles, but that turns into surprise when she whips out her wad of bills and adds the five dollar bill to it. She puts the wad back away]
Sally
All right, you ready? [she turns to face him and puckers up. He looks at her and leans in, closing his eyes. She does not close hers. They kiss on the lips. They then separate and Butters isn't sure what to make of it]
Butters
Thank you! [turns right and walks back to the playground. As he approaches the boys, he raises his arms up and smiles]
Cartman
Atta boy Butters!
Tweek
You did it!
Jimmy
You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
Token
Good job, Butters!
Butters' room, night. He lies there awake, his hands behind his neck, pretty happy about the school day.
Butters
[thinking to himself] Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now. [frowns, thinking of what being a man entails] Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money. [aloud, smiling] Hey, I know.
Lunchtime at the school cafeteria. The kids are eating lunches, and Butters comes into view, stopping at a table of boys.
Butters
Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
Scott
[with a lisp] She'll kiss anybody?
Butters
Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!
Behind the temp building, moments later. Butters waits as Scott gives Sally his five dollars and kisses her.
Scott
Wow. [turns and walks away] It's almost like having someone care about you. [walks back towards the playground]
Sally
Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again.
Butters
[taking his cut] Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
Sally
Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class.
Butters
Aww nuts! [walks off a bit] Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
Sally
What?
Butters
Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
Sally
[walks up to him] Wow, you're right Butters. I should start expanding.
Butters
We could have our very own... [puts out his hands and frames an imaginary plaque] kissin' company.
Butters' bedroom, day. He's got three easels up with info and four girls seated before him. He's using a pointer to highlight the info on the easels. He's laying out his business plan to the girls, who all have notebooks and pencils.
Butters
The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
Sally
Wow, that's a great idea, Butters.
Butters
Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
Megan
[a third grader, taking notes] Got it.
Butters
I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets [puts up a smiling sun sticker on Sally's row on the work schedule] a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
Sally
This is gonna be great!
Park County Police Station, day. Seems Detective Yates is now police captain there. Detective Murphy enters the work room with a report.
Murphy
Sir! Sir, take a look at this. We've got rumors coming in of a possible "prostitution company" starting up in South Park.
Yates
What?! [grabs the report and leafs through it] Hohoo, not in my county!
Murphy
We've got no information on the prostitutes, don't know who they are or where they came from.
Yates
[walks off a bit] So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!
Murphy
Sting operation, sir?
Yates
[turns to face his men] We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!
A seedy side of town, night. Chief Yates is dressed as a hooker and is waiting curbside for a john. A car slowly rolls up, then stops. Yates approaches the car.
Yates
Hey baby, you looking for a party?
Driver
Ha... how much are you charging?
Yates
Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.
Driver
Aww- get in. [Yates gets in and the car takes off]
An alley, night. The car rolls into it.
Yates
Right here's good, sexy. [the driver stops the car] Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex.
Driver
Ok-okay. [grabs his wallet, pulls out a twenty, and hands it to Yates]
Yates
All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants. [the driver unzips his pants] All right! Here we go. [leans down unto the driver's genitals and starting giving him head]
Driver
Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.
Yates
Oh that's all right. [leans down to get something] Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE! [whips out his gun and badge, aiming the gun at the driver] You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
Driver
Awhuh! What?!
Yates
This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution. [grabs his walkie-talkie and talks into it] Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking.
South Park Elementary, day, the hallway. Kids are moving from place to place. Kenny, Cartman and Stan walk by and Kyle stops them.
Kyle
Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
Stan
Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
Kenny
(Stacey Anderson?) [mumbles something more, pulls out his five dollar bill and walks away. Butters walks up to them from the other direction]
Butters
Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon? We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
Stan
Butters, you're the one doing all this?
Butters
Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. [pulls out his stack of bills and shows it off]
Cartman
Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
Butters
I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
Kyle
You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! [slams his locker door shut and walks off with the other three boys]
Butters
...A pimp. Huh...
At the newly-christened Butters Kissing Co, Ltd. in his bedroom. Butters and Sally are at his desk. Butters is researching what it is to be a pimp.
Butters
Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. [smiles]
Sally
Oh. [smiles]
Butters
Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
The Players Ball, night. Pimps and bitches of all shapes and sizes arrive and enter. Inside, they mingle, drink, dance, and Butters walks into view in a shirt and tie, and a name badge. He's sipping something. He spots a grown pimp and two of his bitches.
Butters
[addressing the pimp] Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
Bishop
You? You be pimpin'?
Butters
Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
The Players Ball, A table of pimp trophies to be handed out is shown, then the camera moves up.
Bishop
Now see, you think you're a pimp, but you can't be pimpin', know what I'm sayin'? You wanna be a pimp, then you gotta learn the game. See it's all about knowin' the game.
Butters
What's the game?
Bishop
The game is how you treat the bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Bitch gotta know when she out there, she makin' yo' muthafuckin' money, know what I'm sayin'? You got yo' main bitch, know what I'm sayin'? That be your "bottom bitch." That bitch rank higha than all the other bitches but she still a bitch, know what I'm sayin'?
Butters
[taking notes] Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
Pimp 2
See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?
Butters
I know what you're saying.
Pimp 2
Pimp gotta be out there every motherfuckin' day keepin' his bitches in line. Can't let 'em go shoppin', spendin' their money on stupid shit. Bitches gotta think that's your motherfuckin money, know what I'm sayin'?
Butters
[getting pleased] Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
Butters' home, day. Butters walks in the front door.
Stephen
There you are, Butters!
Butters
Hey Dad!
Stephen
Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend? [Linda doesn't look pleased] Sally Darson?
Butters
Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch. [walks past his parents and up the stairs, but stops for a moment and looks at them.] Do you know what I am saying? [they're left speechless as he continues up the stairs]
A dark alley in South Park, night. Chief Yates is dressed again as a bitch and is in the back seat of someone else's car.
Driver 2
I've got to tell you I... I don't do this kind of thing very often. You're sure you're not a cop, right?
Yates
No way! Let's just get to this, baby.
Driver 2
Alright.
An unmarked police van is nearby, with some officers listening in...
Yates
So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?
Driver 2
Sure, I have the money right here.
Murphy
[to the other officer] Remember, he's going to give us the code word to move in. Wait for the code word, "stretch."
A police cruiser, nearby. Two other cops are listening in as well...
Officer
Code word is "stretch," copy?
A rear shot of the john's car, which has tinted windows.
Yates
Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down.
Driver 2
Oh, you feel good.
Yates
Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.
Driver 2
Oh yes. That's great. [the car begins to move up and down]
Yates
Yeah, you like it?
Driver 2
Oh, I love it!
Yates
Yeah, you're a dirty fuck!
The police van. The officers are shocked.
Yates
Yeah, come on! Harder! Deeper!
Driver 2
Oh yeah! [the van's driver looks back to see if Murphy and the other officer are as shocked as he is] Oh yeah!
Yates
Yeah, teach me a lesson, daddy!
The police cruiser, the two other cops are shocked too...
Yates
Teach this little whore a lesson!
Driver 2
Yeah! Yeah!
Yates
Yeah, that's right!
Driver 2
Awww, awwwww, awwwwoh! [the john's car stops moving] Awh. [the john sounds out of breath] Oh, oh man! [a shot of the john and Yates putting their clothes back on] Thank you! That was great.
Yates
Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a... [leans into him] STRETCH.
The police van. Murphy acts on the code word.
Murphy
Uhhh, that, that's it. Move in! [the police van and car arrive quickly and the officers jump out]
Driver 2
Oh God! It's the police!
Yates
[quickly whips out his badge and gun] Freeze! [takes the john out of the car and throws him against the hood] You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! [the other officers come in and cuff the john]
Driver 2
Please! Please don't do this! I have a wife and kids!
Yates
A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.
The school playground, day. The supervisor comes into view.
Supervisor
[blows her whistle] That's it recess is over back to class.
Kids
[disappointed] Aaaaaaah.
Butters
Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
Annie
So wait, you're keeping all the money now?
Butters
I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch [places his left hand on Sally's right shoulder], and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school! [walks away] Do you know what I am saying?
Fourth Grade classroom, day. Mr. Garrison is writing math problems involving fractions on the blackboard.
Mr. Garrison
Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
Butters
[sees an opportunity...] Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.
Bebe
[bothered] What?
Butters
Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
Bebe
[really bothered] What?!
Butters
Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
Bebe
Shut up!
Butters
Oh, alright then. [copies some problems down, then looks at Wendy. Softly...] Hey Wendy. Wendy! [loudly] Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
Wendy
Leave me alone.
Butters
Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
Stan
Butters. Dude!
Butters
What?
Stan
You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
Butters
Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all. [turns to Wendy] Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
Wendy
Stan!
Stan
Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
Butters
[whips out a bill] Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
Clyde
Wow wee. [grabs the hundred]
Cartman
Dude, we've created a monster.
Butters
Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
Mr. Garrison
Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!
Butters
All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
A shot at the temp buildings from the back of the main building. Butters escorts a new bitch to the area behind one of the buildings.
Butters
Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie? [she gives him a freebie] Ohwoah, [twirls around] whoopie! [walks away, leaving Annie at her new post. As he re-enters the playground, Kyle meets him]
Kyle
Butters, I really think we should talk.
Butters
Sure, Kyle.
Kyle
Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
Butters
Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there. [Kyle turns to see Stan, who's listening to Wendy over at the merry-go-round] He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
Kyle
Butters, what's happened to you?
Butters
What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up! [storms off, but turns once more to ask] Do you know what I am saying?! [turns and continues walking towards the main building]
ATΩ frat house, night. There's a party going on in there.
Frat Boy 1
[from the third floor balcony] Alpha Tau Omega, woo!
Frat Boy 2
[walks by on the street and looks up] ATOs!
Frat Boy 3
Alright, ATOs, our little Kevin is twenty one today! [the other frat boys cheer] And so, Kevin, we would like to welcome you to manhood. Our gift to you. [a huge three-tiered cake is wheeled in and the music changes as Chief Yates jumps out of the cake. He begins to dance around]
Frat Boys
Eewwww!
Singer
Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me,
Calling me all the time like Blondie.
Check out my Chrissie behind,
It's fine all of the time.
Like sex on the beaches,
What else is in the teaches of peaches?
Huh, what?

ATΩ frat house, later that night. Only three windows on the second floor are lit now, and an orgy is heard.
Yates
Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya! [more moaning from the frats] Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE! [silence. Only the crickets are heard. Some minutes later the police swarm the frat house] Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom! [faces the frats] Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. [an officer hands him the bag, which he opens and places under his ass. He proceeds to crap into it, but when the bag is sealed, it's all white - it's all semen.]
Murphy
Sir, sssome of us are wwwondering if maybe y-you're not... taking this role a bit far?
Yates
What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community! [his cell phone rings] Oh, hold on, that's my daddy. [answers the phone] Hey Daddy.
Bishop
[at the other end of the line] Where you at, bitch? I need my bottom bitch right now.
Yates
Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way.
Bishop
I made you my bottom bitch, now you gotta take care of yo' pimp, know what I'm sayin'?
Yates
Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. [limps away painfully]
The streets in another Colorado city, night. Two prostitutes are working a corner with cigarettes in hand. The white one has a black left eye.
Black Bitch
Damn bitch! Yo' pimp beat yo' ass again?
White Bitch
He's an asshole.
Black Bitch
You know, I heard a rumor about some new pimp up in Park County. They say he's real respectful; lots of girls switching over to him.
White Bitch
A pimp that respects his hos? Sign my ass up. [takes a drag from her cigarette]
Butters Kissing Co, Ltd. Butters' stable of bitches has expanded to include some adult prostitutes.
Butters
And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. [looks up at her over his left shoulder]
Charise
Did I do good, Daddy?
Butters
REALLY great work, bitch! That is another... [looks for the right cell to place the sticker on and finds it] sunshine sticker for you.
Charise
Thank you, Daddy. [kisses him on his head]
Butters
[gets excited] Mmmwhoa boy!
ACORN, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, day. Butters is filing some paperwork with the receptionist there. His bitches stand near the entrance waiting for him to finish.
Butters
And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
Receptionist
And exactly what kind of business are you running?
Butters
It's a kissing company.
Receptionist
And you're making a profit?
Butters
Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late. [puts his hand over the right side of his mouth and whispers so Charise doesn't hear] You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
Receptionist
[getting suspicious] Do you keep any record of the men getting these "kisses"?
Butters
'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
Receptionist
Senator Morris?
Butters
Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
Receptionist
Where?
Butters
In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
Receptionist
Alright, get out of here! [throws Butters' papers back at him]
Butters
Huh? Why?
Receptionist
I'm not falling for it!
Butters
But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
Receptionist
[rises in anger] We aren't giving you anything; get out! [her boss walks up next to her]
Boss
Mrs. Davis, is there some kind of problem?
Receptionist
Eh no sir.
Butters
Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. [Mr. Daniels' jaw drops, and Mrs. Davis looks at him]
Butters Kissing Co, Ltd., later. A couple more females have joined the company.
Butters
Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
Sally
Okay.
Charise
Ubup. Daddy, how come this ho get to be bottom bitch?
Sally
What?
Charise
I make the most money for you Daddy, that means if anyone should be bottom bitch, it's me.
Sally
[she and Charise face off] Hey, screw off, ho.
Charise
Fair is fair, ho.
Butters
[rushes in to keep the hos from fighting] Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!
Yates
[voice only] Excuse me! [comes through the door] Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?
Butters
Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
Yates
Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.
Bishop
[voice heard outside the window] Yolanda! [his car honks repeatedly] Yolanda!
Butters
What's that?
Butters' front door, moments later. Everyone has gone downstairs to see who's calling Yolanda. Bishop is on one knee with a bouquet of flowers in his hands.
Bishop
[pleading] Yolanda please! You gotta come back to me! I got nothin' without you!
Yates
You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!
Bishop
[on his feet] Yolanda, I looove you. I need you. Not as my bottom bitch. I want... [back on one knee] I want to marry you. [opens a small box in which rests an engagement ring. Yates looks moved by this display of affection]
Yates
It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.
Butters
Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
Bishop
[crying gratefully] Thanks, pimp. You done changed the game, that's what you did. [offers the ring once more] Marry me Yolanda? We'll move to a little château in Switzerland and get away from all this.
Yates
Oh Keshawn! [runs to him and they hug and kiss for a long time]
Butters
Wha? Awww.
Bishop
I love you so much.
Yates
Babe, I love you too.
Bishop
So much, baby.
Yates
Let's, uh, let's just be happy okay?
Bishop
Promise, babe. Promise.
Butters
[moved to tears] Oh, oh. [feeling remorse] Oh jeez. [closes the front door softly]
Butters' living room.
Butters
Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee. [the girls come and genuflect] Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
The Swiss château. The camera zooms in from a great distance. Bishop and Yates are enjoying their new home.
Bishop
Happy anniversary baby. [slips a diamond necklace on Yates' neck] Do you like 'em?
Yates
I love 'em, darling.
Bishop
I wanted to get you something extra-special.
Yates
[reaches down to get something] Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the... [whips out his gun and badge] FREEZE!! Ha! You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
End of Butters' Bottom Bitch

W.T.F.
A professional wrestling ring. John Cena and Edge are in the ring with two lady wrestlers. One of them wears a pink bra, the other a black one.
John Cena
Say that again, Edge! You think you're better than me?!
Edge
Cena, your mouth has gotten you in trouble for the last time! I'm gonna shut it up for you!
Spectators
Oooooooooooooooooooooo!
Darryl
Mess him up, Edge!
Obese Woman
Kick his ass! WOO!
John Cena
Oh yeah?! I've got somethin' else to tell you, Edge! I slept with Vanessa last night. [everyone boos. Vanessa, the one with the pink bra, is embarrassed and tries to hide her face]
Redneck 1
[his vest has a tag that says "Eddie" on it] Cena slept with Edge's girlfriend?
Cartman
Oh my God, dude, this is sooo awesome!
Stan
I'm having the best time!
Edge
[a huge image of himself is on a massive TV screen behind him] You cheated, and took my belt from me, and now I can't hardly get work wrestling! You took muh girl AND you took my job! [all gasp]
Darryl
He took his job!
Redneck 2
He took his jrrr?
Redneck 3
Took hid drrr! [Edge throws down the mic and prepares to attack Cena. Edge slaps Cena hard enough that Cena falls to the ground, then does a victory pose. The ladies begin to wrestle]
Cartman
Oh, sweet! [the woman in black bra pulls on the other woman's arm using her right leg as leverage, then begins pummeling her. Cena throws Edge against the ropes]
Edge
Whoa... [flies off the ropes and into Cena's clothesline, which sends him to the floor on his back.]
Butters
Yes! Yehhehehes!
Cartman
This is awesome!
The Pepsi Center, night. The show has ended and the fans are pouring out of the center towards their cars. The boys come out as well: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Butters, Jimmy, and Token.
Cartman
Dude! That was so badass!
Kyle
Wrestling is awesome!
Stan
This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! [the other boys cheer this decision.]
South Park Elementary, after school, gym. A sign on the gym door says the junior wrestling club is meeting at 4:15. The gym has new windows. The seven boys are present, all wearing protective gear and wrestling uniforms. They look down at their uniforms.
Cartman
The fuck is this?!
Stan
[a couple of seconds later] Why did they have us put on long underwear.
Kyle
Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
Butters
Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
Kyle
Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
Cartman
I did. I'm the Rad Russian. [affects a fake Russian accent] I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
Coach
[arriving] Alright boys! I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits interested in the fine sport of wrassling.
Kyle
Cool!
Stan
Yeah!
Butters
Let's do this!
Cartman
All right!
Coach
Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name?
Cartman
The Rad Russian.
Coach
What?
Cartman
You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
Coach
Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees.
Cartman
Huh?
Coach
Just, down on, down on the floor. [Cartman bends over a bit, unsure of how to do this, given his girth] Hands and knees. [the coach helps him out in getting into position.]
Cartman
Okay...
Coach
Alright and now how about you. Your name is?
Butters
Triceratops!
Coach
Uh, all right, uh cu, come on over here. I'm gonna position you in the official wrassling starting position. [drapes Butters over Cartman] Here- we- go.
Cartman
The fuck is this?!
Coach
Now just reach around him here. Good.
Cartman
Dude! Dude! DUDE! [jumps to his feet] The fuck are you doing?!
Coach
Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling!
Cartman
That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
Stan
Yeah, what are you? A child molester?
Kyle
Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
Coach
Oh, not this again! Let me guess: you just went to that stupid WWE show in Denver last night!
The Boys
Yeah! [all smiles]
Coach
Ugh. [the boys frown at this] The WWE is not wrassling! That's a bunch of fake bullcrap! How stupid are you! Real wrassling, boys, is this! [spreads his arms out to indicate the floor and their uniforms - practice, practice, practice]
Cartman
Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. [they all take off their headgear and walk away]
Stan
Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
Butters
I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! [throws his headgear on the floor and walks away glaring back at the coach]
Coach
Rrrgh!
Cartman's house, day. He holds up a program written in crayon.
Cartman
The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say "You slept with my girlfriend," and I'll charge you into a head slap.
Jimmy
Sounds good.
Cartman
Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like "No no, the fight hasn't started yet," and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
Butters
Okey doke.
Jimmy
So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
Cartman
Noo, let's save the "girlfriend is a whore" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
Butters
Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
Cartman
Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
Stan
Yup.
Cartman
Alright, let's start wrestlin'. [the boys take their starting positions]
Jimmy
I am gonna k-kick your ass!
Cartman
You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! [Cartman slaps him hard, and Jimmy falls. Butters intervenes.]
Butters
Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
Cartman
Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste-[Jimmy sneaks up behind him with a folding chair and smashes it into the back of his head, making him fall forward] ah!
Jimmy
Your girlfriend is a whore!
Cartman
[whispers aloud] Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
Jimmy
[softly] Oh, I'm sorry.
Token
You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!
Stan
We'll see about that!
Butters
Now hold on! I am stopping the fight! [Stan headbutts him] Eoh!
A park behind the Cartman house. The wall separating the backyard from the field is gone.
Redneck 4
What's goin' on?
Redneck 5
Apparently that crippled kid slept with that Russian kid's girlfriend.
Redneck 4
Jeez they're so young.
First match.
Kyle
I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
Butters
That's because your mother betrayed my mother, Juggernaut!
Second match.
Stan
You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
Cartman
And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
Stan
I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
From the seats in the backyard.
Redneck 6
That kid was in 'Nam? Man, that's incredible!
Redneck 7
Good for you for serving your country!
Out on the street, a redneck runs to tell the rednecks haning out on a truck.
Redneck 8
Guys, check this out! There's this little kid from the Congo, who was raised by panthers!
Redneck 9
Are you serious?
Third match.
Kyle
Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
Token
I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
From the seats in the backyard. There are more chairs present.
Redneck 10
That kid in the hat is havin' sex with two different girls?
Redneck 11
Naw, that little kid from the Congo lied about one of them to try and get the kid in the hat in trouble with his wife.
Redneck 12
They're married?
Fourth match intro.
Jimmy
You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back!
Cartman
I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
From the seats in the backyard.
Redneck 9
That Russian kid's got hepatitis?
Fourth match.
Announcer
And here he comes now, the cold-blooded wrestler from Mexico, El Pollo Loco! [Kenny, dressed as a masked luchador, comes out to mariachi fanfare and sparklers. The spectators clap and cheer him on]
Jimmy
What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?
Kenny
(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
Nighttime. The wrestling matches are coming one after the other, connected by convoluted plot lines and story arcs.
Kyle
Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
Stan
You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
Kyle
If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
Announcer
Uh oh, here she comes now! It's Bad Irene! [Cartman, dressed as a diva, walks out of the dressing room and towards the ring. The crowd hoots and hollers. She climbs right in and takes the mic from Stan's hand]
Cartman
Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
Stan
What?!
Redneck 13
No! No! What are you doing?! Stan the Man loves you!
Redneck 14
Don't break his heart!
Stan
If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
Cartman
It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. [the crowd boos and expresses its disapproval]
Kyle
Irene, no! Why?
Cartman
Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
Redneck 15
Whoa, did you hear that?
Redneck 16
Shh!
Stan
Irene, you said you loved me!
Cartman
I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! [screams, runs up to Stan with a steel chair, and smashes him with it, knocking him down]
Spectators
Ohhhh! [Kyle runs up to Cartman and knocks him down with a flying kick] Ahhhh!
Skeeter's Bar, night. A bunch of men are gathered at the bar chatting.
Darryl
I'm telling you guys, you've got to see this. These kids ain't more than eight or nine years old an' they got more problems than you can imagine.
Redneck 13
There's this one kid, he saw his father get murdered. And yesterday he finds the killer, and it's this other kid whose an ex-cop. Needless to say, he whupped his ass good.
Darryl
Yup, and there's this little girl, she's actually addicted to gettin' abortions. Got pregnant by nearly every boy there.
Redneck 17
You're shittin' me!
Redneck 13
No! We're telling you these kids are fucking crazy! You gotta check it out! [the wrestling coach is sitting nearby, stewing at the conversation]
Darryl
You can watch 'em almost every afternoon. It's some of the greatest wrestlin' we ever seen.
Coach
[rises from his seat and approaches the men at he bar] It isn't real! Don't you people understand that stuff isn't real?! None of it! How stupid are you?! [Skeeter and another bar patron look at each other]
Redneck 13
[strokes his chin thoughtfully] What do you mean, it ain't real?
Coach
It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?!
Darryl
[walks up to the coach] Mister, there's a little girl out there who's had fourteen abortions, an' she ain't even ten yet. But I guess that's just [holds up two fingers on each hand in a quote gesture] "not real" to you! [turns and walks back to the bar, saying under his breath] Son of a bitch.
Coach
Look look look! [whips out his iPhone to show them] THIS is wrestling. THIS. [two men are shown wrestling in Greco-Roman style. There's a lot of grunting in the match. The bar patrons watch the little screen for a few seconds]
Darryl
Mister, you'd better take your gay porn an' walk right out of this bar.
Cartman's backyard, a new dressing room. The boys prepare for their matches. Stan looks out through the curtains.
Stan
Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
Kyle
Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
Cartman
Alright you guys, let's bring it in. [the boys huddle and hold hands] I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
Butters
Yeah!
Kyle
Let's do this! One! Two!
Boys
Backyard wrestling!
Cartman's backyard, moments later. The yard has been transformed into a Greek amphitheater. A façade now covers the back side of the house and a wrestling ring is in the amphitheater's pit. The place looks filled to capacity with people chattering, waiting for the matches to begin. The amphitheater lights dim and the crowd cheers as the wrestlers come out.
Cartman
Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
Stan
Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
Redneck 13
Gee, I didn't know his parents did that.
Redneck 18
Shhh.
South Park Elementary, principal's office, day. Principal Victoria is talking with the wrestling coach.
Principal Victoria
I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.
Coach
You're firing me? Why?!
Principal Victoria
The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. [shows him the South Park Gazette, which has the headline "Kids Wrestle with Adult Issues"]
Coach
No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is!
Principal Victoria
I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.
Coach
You can't fire me for what these kids do!
Principal Victoria
That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
Coach
What do you mean?
Principal Victoria
[sighs] We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Conners.
The wrestling dressing room, day. The boys are dressing up for another round of wrestling matches. Kyle and Token are talking.
Kyle
So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
Token
Oh! Sure, that works.
Cartman
[rushing in with a letter] You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
Kyle
What dude? [the other boys gather 'round]
Cartman
We just received a letter from the WWE.
Stan
From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
Butters
No way!
Cartman
"Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."
Stan
Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
Kyle
This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. [Stan and Kyle begin chanting "Omigod!" repeatedly]
Stan
Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
Kyle
Oh my God... Oh my God...
Token
I can't believe it's him.
Butters
I'm freaking out...
Kyle
[fans himself] Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
Cartman
Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
Stan
Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
Intermission. The crowd is milling around in the front lawn, and the darkened amphitheater is visible behind the fence.
Darryl
Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number.
Redneck 19
Yeah, but Rad Russian has a lot of abandonment issues. [a chime sounds, indicating the start of the second act]
Darryl
Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back.
The amphitheater. The lights come up on Kyle in the ring, who begins to speak.
Kyle
I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do. [an elderly fan holds up a sign: "STOP RUNNING JUGGERNAUT"] And I, again, am alone. [Stan, Butters, and Token climb into the ring behind him]
Stan
Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. [Kyle turns to see the other three boys]
Butters
Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
Kyle
I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
Redneck 20
He don't run from fights, just from responsibilities. [Token swings a chair into the back of Kyle's head, and Kyle falls to the floor]
Crowd
Oohhhhh! [Token begins to twist Kyle's arm] Boooooooo!
Stan
What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother. [Kenny climbs into the ring as El Pollo Loco] And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. [Kenny picks up the chair and swings it into Token, and Stan turns to see him]
Announcer
It's El Pollo Loco! [a section full of Mexican fans hold up a Mexican flag and two banners: "Viva El Pollo Loco" and "Me Gusta El Pollo Loco"]
Sizzler, Thursday. The four boys are seated at a table.
Cartman
Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
Kyle
Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
Cartman
Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
Kenny
(Yeah, we've been talking.)
Cartman
And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
Stan
Yeah?
Cartman
Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
Kenny
(Yep.)
Kyle
What are you talking about?
Cartman
Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
Stan
He's right.
Kyle
What?
Stan
Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
Cartman
Right?
Stan
And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
Kyle
Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
Cartman
No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
Kenny
(They're gonna hurt our chances.)
Cartman
Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
Kyle
So what do we do?
Kenny
(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)
Cartman
Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
Stan
Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
Kyle
How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
Cartman
It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
Tryouts, later on. Syncopated music plays, similar to "All That Jazz." The four boys are seated at a table a few rows up in the amphitheater.
Cartman
Number seventeen step forward, please? [a man steps forward shielding his eyes from the glare of the spotlights] You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!
Number 17
[gets into a slight crouch] You dirty Muslim bastard! I don't trust you, and I never will! Do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! No you wouldn't, you smelly brown Middle Eastern piece of sh-
Cartman
Thank you! Number twenty-four? [another man steps forth as Number 17 returns to his place] You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
Number 24
Your father! Your own father! [slaps himself four times] I don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! Whore!
Cartman
Thank you. [Number 24 returns to his place]
Kyle
That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
Kenny
(Mhm.)
Stan
Yeah yeah, not bad.
Cartman
Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again. [Number 37 steps forward] We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
Number 37
Not a whole lot to tell, really. Was born in Fort Collins, started watching wrestling when I was four years old. My father... he liked it too. Until he died. [stirring music begins to play] Sometimes I think it's 'cause of him I followed this dream. [breaks into song]
All my life, all I ever wanted was to
Beeeee a wrestler
Fiiiiighting in the ring
Winning that belt.
And so I dreamed every night that I was the
Uuuuundertaaker
Smaaaaashing skulls in
Breaking arms.
But I'm so worked up. This is something I can do.
Do I have what it takes inside?

Stan
Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.
Cartman
Yeah, this guy crushes.
The coach's trophy room. A whole bunch of wrestling trophies and awards are shown as the camera pans to the right. The coach is seated in his armchair.
Mr. Conners
It isn't fair. All my hard work. [he's reading Saturday's Gazette, which has Vince McMahon's picture and name under the headline "Wrestling Smackdown Brings WWE President"] I'm not going to take it anymore. [he throws the paper to the floor, gets up from the chair, and walks over to a mirror.] That wrestling show is in for a big surprise. [grabs his headgear and puts it on] I'm putting an end to this once and for all! [gets into a wrestling stance] Hyaaaaa!
Cartman's house, Saturday night. A banner under the second-floor windows reads "ULTIMATE SMACKDOWN TONIGHT!!!" People from all over South Park gather on the front lawn. A white limo with the WWE logo emblazened on it comes to a stop in front of the house.
Kyle
[standing on a stool by the front window] He's here! Vince McMahon is here! [the other boys arrive. An assistant opens the back door and Vince steps out and surveys the front yard.]
Jimmy
Oowow, it's really him.
Stan
He's here, Ohh my God [Kyle hops off the stool and joins Stan in the chant] Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
Cartman
[preparing to dress as Irene] Alright, places everyone.
The backyard amphitheater. The lights go out and two spotlights light up the ring.
Cartman
[over the speakers] Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. [An opera box has been built to accommodate McMahon. It has four seats, and an usher takes McMahon and assistant to their seats. Vince has his own personal Playbill with "WTF" on the cover]
Stan
Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?
Kyle
You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
Stan
Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
Kyle
Wait a minute. Who is that?
Stan
It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. [Coach Connors sneaks up to the side of Cartman's house with a briefcase and puts his back up against the wall]
Kyle
You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!
Cartman
My man can do whatever he wants.
Mr. Conners
Stay calm, you know what you have to do.
Cartman
You're just gonna have to deal with that.
Mr. Conners
For the good of real wrassling. [quickly moves away and out of sight]
Butters
No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
Cartman
My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
Stan
No, you can't possibly mean that-!
Cartman
Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
Crowd
Awwwww!
Kyle
There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
Number 37
[leaps into view in yellow tights and red boots] Mother! Why did you abort me? Why?
Redneck 21
He's alive!
Cartman
You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
The opera box.
Assistant
What do you think?
Stan
Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you do something informal like that.
Vince
They are decent wrestlers. We'll see how they develop their through lines in the second act. [whips out some opera glasses and puts them on]
Under the bleachers. Coach Connors is sneaking around, occasionally going into a wrestling stance.
Jimmy
Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!
Butters
Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
Guard
[catching up to the coach] Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits.
Butters
[after Jimmy says something] Are you sure?
Mr. Conners
Oh don't mind me. [puts down his briefcase] I was just about to- [quickly gets the guard to the ground and takes up the starting position of wrassling.]
Guard
[seems to be enjoying all the moves and grunts the coach is making] Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?
The backyard amphitheater. The next segment begins with the Rad Russian holding court while the other wrestlers sway to the music behind him.
Cartman
O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
An upper floor under the bleachers. The coach climbs up a ladder to this floor and sets his briefcase down. He opens the case and assembles the rocket-propeled grenade launcher inside it.
Stan
When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
Butters
He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
Jimmy
Lies! These are all a bunch of lies! [back to the ring. Kenny has a bloody baby doll under his left arm. A fake umbilical cord is attached to it] Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!
Kenny
(I can keep the baby...)
The railing at the very top of the amphitheater, behind the topmost seats. The coach climbs up and over it with his RPGL.
Cartman
Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw. [The coach picks up the RPGL, puts it on his shoulder, and takes aim] We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
Mr. Conners
[while Cartman speaks] Only one shot. [moves his aim from the ring to the opera box] Maximum damage. [zooms in on McMahon] This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING! [fires the launcher and the rocket takes off. It goes towards the façade, but stops and drops harmlessly into the ring] NO! [Kenny picks it up. It comes back to life and takes off with him holding on. They go all over the place, but finally take off into the sky, where the grenade blows up and releases fireworks. Below, Mexican fans of El Pollo Loco hold up banners: "Viva El Pollo Loco" "Me Gusta El Pollo Loco"]
Fan 1
O dios mio, mataron al Pollo Loco!
Fan 2
Bastardos! [Kenny's theme music comes up as the fireworks continue coming down. Vince and his assistant stand up and applaud the performance]
Mr. Conners
[coming down the bleachers towards the ring] No! No, shut up! [steps into the ring] You idiots want wrassling?! This is wrassling! [performs some wrestling stances and grunts, but gets booed]
Redneck 22
We want some real wrestlers!
Mr. Conners
This is just a bunch of garbage! And you are all ruining the good name of wrassling! [the boos continue] Wrassling is from ancient Greece! It's in the Olympics!
Darryl
What the hell do you care?! Get off the wrestlin' mat! Boo!
Mr. Conners
Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It's practically gone from the culture. Damn it they took my job!
Crowd
[suddenly confused] Huh? What?
Redneck 5
They took his job.
Redneck 23
I know. Sshh. [the crowd falls silent, waiting for his next words]
Mr. Conners
You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all ripped away from you like a babe from its mother.
Darryl
Oh man, they took his job?
Redneck 13
They took hid-drr.
Mr. Conners
Lost everything! Couldn't even afford to pay for my... little retriever Rex anymore! Animal Control came and got him!
Redneck 24
They took his dog!
Redneck 25
They tok hid-drr!
Redneck 5
Took hid-drrr!
Mr. Conners
I ended up on the streets, stealing! Got busted by the police and had to spend the night in jail! The other inmates, they all beat me up and fractured my jaw to where I couldn't eat!
Redneck 26
They broke his jaw!
Redneck 22
Theeyy broke his jaw!
Redneck 27
Brk hij-jrr! [a rooster in a cage crows]
Mr. Conners
So you see I have nothing left. Nothing! Not even the will to live. [He closes his eyes. The crowd takes it in, applauds, then gives him a standing ovation. He opens his eyes, surprised at the reaction. Flowers begin falling at his feet, and Vince McMahon steps into the ring to approach him]
Vince
Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen.
Mr. Conners
What?
Vince
Will you not join our wrestling organization? I promise to make you our leading act.
Mr. Conners
You, you mean it?
Vince
Come! I want to get you in rehearsals right away! [leaves the ring with the coach]
Kyle
What?
Stan
Dude.
Cartman
Hey, what about us? Our show? [the coach is now grinning as the two men walk away]
Vince
Sorry boys. You are decent wrestlers, but lack the raw wrestling talent this man has.
The Boys
Aaaaah.
Cartman
This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
Kyle
Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
Jimmy
Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
Stan
What?? [three fights break out in the ring: Cartman vs. Kyle, Jimmy vs. Stan, and Token vs. Butters]
Jimmy
You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!
Stan
Don't go pointing fingers at me, Cartman! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... [the fighting continues. The crowd gets bored of this unscripted fight]
Redneck 28
What the hell's this?
Redneck 29
This is Goddamned fake!
Darryl
Screw this, this is just stupid. [leaves his seat. Other spectators leave their seats as the boys continue to fight in the ring]
Cartman
Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
Redneck 30
FAKE!
Cartman
Kenny! I'm-
End of W.T.F.

Whale Whores
Denver Aquarium, day. A group of people are wading around in a dolphin pool. Among them are the Marshes.
Chet
All right, everyone, welcome to the Dolphin Encounter here at the Denver Aquarium. [a woman behind him waves at everyone. Randy takes a picture of the trainers] My name is Chet and I'll be your guide and trainer as you meet these intelligent and truly magical creatures. [several dolphins swim in from another part of the pool] And here they come: this is Trigger and Dolly, uh there's Bubbles.
Stan
[happily] Wow cool.
Randy
Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?
Stan
Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
Chet
If they come near you you can touch their back just no grabbing please. What whimsical creatures aren't they? All the dolphins you will be encountering today are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Now who would like to get a kiss from one?
Girl
I would like to-
Randy
[barging in] MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
Chet
Uh all right, let's just uh, get you to put your hands, palms down, on the water. [a dolphin swims by] The- [a rumble is heard, and then gets louder]
Stan
What the hell is that? [the trainer turns around. A group of Japanese men in kimonos run towards the pool with harpoons in hand.]
Trainer 2
Oh no it's the Japanese! [The group jumps in and proceeds to stab every dolphin in there repeatedly until the dolphins bleed to death, then jumps out of the pool and runs back towards the way it came from.]
Japanese Man 1
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck youuu dofiiin!
Japanese Man 2
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you dofiiin! [they leave behind a pool of dead dolphins and bewildered guests. The girl begins to cry.]
Another location. The guide here is in front of a huge tank with a thick glass wall through which sea life can be seen.
Guide
These are our favorite animals here at the Atlanta Zoo. It's Dolly and Seymour. They are beluga whales. These whales live mostly in the Arctic region- [the Japanese men strike again, making everyone else run out of the area, breaking the wall with their harpoons.]
Japanese Man 3
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, whaaales!
The Baltimore Aquarium. Some dolphins are performing tricks when the Japanese men strike a third time.
Trainer 3
All right Jessica, now put your arms out like this. [little Jessica lifts her arms out and open] Great job, Jessica!
Japanese Man 4
Fuck you, whaaale! [jumps onto the platform and harpoons the whale, then runs off without taking the harpoon]
Jessica
AAAAAAAA!
Stan's house, night, Stan's bedroom. He's moping on his bed. Randy peeks in to see how Stan is doing, then walks in and goes to Stan's bed.
Randy
[sigh] Hey pal. [sits by him] Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
Stan
Dad, why did they do that?
Randy
Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt! [Stan moves his arms out of the way and looks at the shirt - a white "I swam with the dolphins" T-shirt with blood splattered on it.] And you always have your neat picture. [hands Stan the framed picture on the nightstand, which Stan opens and looks at. It's of Stan and a dead dolphin, with the caption "My New Friend!" underneath]
The Miami Dolphins home field, Land Shark Stadium, day.
Commentator 1
Dan Dierdorf here, welcoming you to this great football matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins. We're all set for kickoff and- [the Japanese men strike again]
Commentator 2
Oh Dan it looks like Japanese people are now rushing onto the field. [the Japanese men stab and kill all the Dolphin players] This is not the kind of thing you want happening during kickoff. [the Japanese men run off]
Japanese Man 5
(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, dofiiin!
Channel 9 News.
News Anchor
Several whales and dolphins were again slaughtered by the Japanese today, this time at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom near San Francisco. [a shot of the Japanese killing the dolphins there] Aquariums had been experimenting with methods to keep the Japanese out, but so far nothing seems to stop them. When asked if all of Japan supported the slaughtering of whales and dolphins, the current Prime Minister of Japan, Yukio Hatoyama, had this to say:
Hatoyama
[clears his throat] (In Japanese Accent) Fuck you weiru [gives the finger with his right hand], anda fuck you dohfiiin! [gives the finger with his left hand]
Cartman's house, day. Cartman is singing Lady Gaga's "Poker Face". He's at the chorus while Kenny is on a Rock Band drum set. Kyle is on a Rock Band guitar.
Cartman
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.

Stan
[as Cartman finishes the chorus] Guys... guys... [Cartman turns off the mic] Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
Cartman
What do you mean? This song is sweet.
Stan
No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
Kyle
Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
Stan
So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something.
Kyle
What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
Stan
It seems like everyone has an attitude of "that's just the way they are" or "that's just the way it is"! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
Cartman
I'm not too busy, Stan.
Stan
You're not?
Cartman
No, I just don't care. At all.
Kenny
(Yeah, me neither.)
Stan
Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
Cartman
[speaking into the mic] Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
Stan
You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! [turns and walks out the front door. The boys don't move for a few seconds, then Cartman launches back into "Poker Face".]
Cartman
I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.

Stan's room, sometime later. He's at his desk, pissed off that Cartman and the others don't seem moved by the slaughter. Butters peeks in, then approaches Stan.
Butters
Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
Stan
[lights up] Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?
Butters
Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
Stan
[turns to look at Butters] Really? [gets off his chair] People who are doing something?
Butters
I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
Stan
[determined] Then that's where I belong.
OP for Whale Wars, a montage of scenes from that show.
Singer
The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
Captain Paul Watson
Yeah, we're badass.
Singer
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
Male Crew 1
Any means necessary! We're not protesters, we're pirates! ["Whale Wars" shows up onscreen]
Whale Wars. The Sea Shepherd is shown floating in the middle of the ocean. In the bridge the Shepherd's crew is gathered.
Captain
That's definitely a Japanese boat. [looks through his binoculars] Looks like they're whaling now. [sure enough, the Japanese, on the Herro Maru No. 3, are throwing harpoons at the whales. Random cries of "Gojira" come forth]
Japanese Sailor
Fuck youuu, weiruu!
First Mate
Oh my God, they're gonna kill those humpbacks!
Woman
We've gotta do something!
Captain
Pull up next to them. The fight is on!
Stan
Sweet! [the Sea Shepherd pulls up alongside the Herro Maru. The whalers gather at the railings and razz the Sea Shepherd]
Captain
[taking his crew out to the deck] Are we ready to do this?
Crew
Yeah!
Stan
Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!
Captain
Are we badasses?
Crew, Stan
Yeah!
Captain
Are we badasses?
Crew, Stan
Yeah!
Captain
All right, so... what do we do? [the Japanese continue razzing them] Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?
Crewman
[masked] Great idea, Captain!
Aussie Crewman
I'll start right now. [begins punching himself on the cheek]
Woman
"Oh my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales."
Captain
Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?
Stan
Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
Captain
Why not?
Stan
Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
Captain
You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready? [the crewmen hold up sticks of something...] Ready? And... throw the stinky butter at them! [they throw the sticks at the Herro Maru and hit it, leaving blotches in various places. One explodes next to two sailors, who just look at the mess it leaves]
Luke
Haha, you stink now! Haha!
Stan
Wait, that's it?
Captain
Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one.
Stan
Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
Captain
Well no, that'd be illegal.
Crewman 2
Yeah.
Stan
[can't believe how toothless their threats are] I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
Woman
I'm a pirate in a war.
Stan
Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
Captain
We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
Luke
The Japanese are scared of how hardcore we are. [a Japanese gunner prepares a large harpoon in a cannon and fires it off. It strikes the Shepherd's captain's head, goes through it, and pins him on the wall, killing him instantly. Blood comes out everywhere]
Woman
Paul! [the Japanese sailors cheer this small victory]
Crewman
Paul?
Crewman 2
What do we do?
Woman
We don't have a captain!
Crewman
Oh my God, oh my God!
Woman 2
[masked] Maybe he's okay.
Stan turns and goes towards a utility box. He opens it, rifles through it and finds a flare gun. He takes it, goes to the railing, and fires a flare at the Herro Maru. It finds the fuel storage area, lights up, and soon the barrels and boxes in that area begin to burn and explode. The Japanese try to put out the fire, but it's no use.
Crewman 2
Oh my God.
Luke
What did you do?
Stan
What you assholes acted like you were doing? [cries of "ikaban" come from the Herro Maru as it slowly sinks in the ocean and Japanese sailors jump off the ship]
Montage as Cartman sings "Poker Face". An Entertainment Weekly cover with Captain Stan on it and the lead story "'Whale Wars' Gets Better. Things Actually Happen Now." The crewmen are now throwing Molotov cocktails at the ships, and the Japanese run for cover. Next, Stan steers the Sea Shepherd. Next, Stan is shown with a large new cannon, having just fired a grenade at a whaling ship with it. The crew dances with joy. Next, a Variety cover with the new captain and the headline, "Whale Wars Ratings Skyrocket. New Captain Not A Fat Liar Like The Old One." Next, Stan leads the crew as they act as a volunteer security force at aquariums across the country. Next, a People cover with Captain Stan and his crew, and the cover story, "WHALE WARS New Cast Member Turns Vegan Pussies Into Actual Pirates. 19-page exclusive article." Finally, Stan and crew stand before a covered statue at Sea World. The Japanese head their way to get into the park.
Stan
Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! [the crew pulls at the ropes, and the covers comes off the statue - it's Godzilla.]
The Japanese
Ohhhh Gojira! Gojira! [they turn and run away]
Someone is reading a newspaper, the World News, on which is the headline "LITTLE BOY SINKS ANOTHER JAPANESE BOAT!" and a picture of Stan on the Sea Shepherd pointing at another sinking Japanese ship.
Hatoyama
Nippon no gaijin! ["Stranger to Japan!" He looks at the paper again] Kuso, taberu na! ["Eat shit!" Crumples up the paper and throws it down.]
Larry King Live.
Announcer
And now, Larry King, live.
Larry King
My guest tonight is the little boy who took over the Whale Wars reality show and turned it into a big hit. Please welcome Stan Marsh and his crew.
Luke
'Ey Jordan! I'm on Larry King, mate!
Larry King
So Stan, what motivated you, what... inspired you to get out there and make a hit TV show?
Stan
No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
Larry King
Once you became captain the methods used to stop the Japanese definitely became more aggressive. Was that the key to help boost your ratings?
Stan
...No, I don't care about the show.
Woman 2
We're pirates.
Stan
I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls!
Woman 2
I've got balls! [Stan looks at her a bit annoyed]
Larry King
Well there are many people who see what you're doing as a positive thing, and of course, many that see problems with it. Joining us now is one of those people and... [goes into split screen, with another guest speaking via satellite] You say Stan's methods are unethical.
Sid
Larry, you can't just go out and take matters into your own hands like this. If you want a hit TV show you have to go through producers, directors, people that are in unions.
Larry King
But Sid, you saw the show before Stan took it over; you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama.
Sid
Yes, but it doesn't justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network.
Stan
Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
Larry King
But their old captain, Paul Watson [a real-life photo of him is shown], was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause.
Sid
He yes, of course, everyone knows that Paul Watson was a smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility, but we must-
Stan
Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
The rechristened Real Whale Wars.
Announcer
On this episode of Real Actual Whale Wars, Captain Marsh searches for the Japanese fleet, knowing they could be absolutely anywhere. [Stan is shown on the bridge planning their next move with Crewman 2]
Stan
Would you mind stepping back a little?
Luke
Captain! Captain, some new volunteers showed up to help us in our crusade! [the cameraman and boom mic operator take a few steps back]
Stan
No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
Luke
But they say you know them. [Cartman and Kenny walk through the door]
Cartman
Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! [his sweater has "SAVE THE WHALES" on it, while Kenny's parka now has "DOLPHIN LOVER" on it].
Stan
Oh no, no, NO.
Cartman
What dude?
Stan
Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
Cartman
We always have.
Kenny
(Yeah, totally!)
Stan
I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
Cartman
That's not what we said.
Stan
You said "Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!"
Cartman
We were talking about Wales the country.
Stan
Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
Kenny
(I just want to be on TV.)
Cartman
[under his breath] Kenny! [to Stan] I deserve to be on TV.
Crewman 2
Captain! Captain, the Japanese have been spotted near buoy 24!
Stan
Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
Cartman
[popping up in front of the camera] All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! [grins and pumps a fist]
Announcer
[an aerial view of the Sea Shepherd is shown] Captain Marsh races his boat to the last known location of the Japanese whalers. If he doesn't get there in time, hundreds of dolphins or whales could die.
Stan
As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! [the Sea Shepherd lurches all of a sudden.]
Crewman 2
What the hell was that?!
Crewman 3
We just got rammed.
Stan
Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
Crewman 4
It's not the Japanese.
Stan
What? [goes outside with the crew]
Announcer
On deck the crew is surprised at what they see. The other boat is from Deadliest Catch, a crab-fishing reality show.
DC Captain
You think you're so cool, don'tcha?! You think you're big boat reality show on the block?! [goes to a cage and pulls out a crab from it] You're taking away men's livelihoods!
Stan
What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
DC Captain
You're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!
Cartman
Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
DC Crewman
Your show is fuckin' gay!
Stan
Screw this! Turn hard to port! [takes the wheel and starts turning left]
Announcer
But everywhere his reality show's boat turns, the crab fishing reality boat blocks its path. [the crab boat, being smaller and faster, blocks the Sea Shepherd's path quickly]
Stan
Dude, fuck you!
DC Captain
Fuck you!
Announcer
It's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't budging. [Stan is in the captain's quarters, sitting behind a desk, his face buried in his arms] Captain Marsh's boat is dead in the water. He can't go after the Japanese, he can't help the whales or dolphins. Once again on Whale Wars, nothing is happening.
Crewman 3
[name: Benjamin Potts] It's pretty difficult times because uh, we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped, a, another whale is dying.
Cartman
[gets emotional] Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like [sniff], we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
Kenny
(And they're all shot.) [cries]
Cartman
Shhh, Kenny... [the camera zooms in on Kenny, who's got his face in his hands] Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he- [flashes an angry look at the camera] Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though. [The camera pulls back to its previous position] Yeah, keep it there. [Cartman resumes his tale] He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
Kenny
(I would do anything!) [puts his face back in his hands and cries.]
Announcer
The crab-fishing reality show is doing just fine. [the crewmen celebrate another great catch.]
DC Crew
Yeah! Woohoo! Alright! [Stan is again shown in the captain's quarters, his face still buried in his arms on the desk]
Announcer
But for the Whale Wars crew, it appears the show is over. Until... a sound is heard. [whale sounds. Stan lifts his head up]
Stan
What was that? [moments later the crew goes on deck. Stan is with them]
Benjamin
Captain, look!
The Crew
Wow. Whoa. [before them are a bunch of whales. One of them rams the crab fishing reality show boat]
Woman 2
The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!
Stan
It's like... they know. [two whales latch onto buoys at either end of a net and begin to haul away the crab fishing boat.]
DC Crewmen
Hey. Heeey. Noo! Stop! [the Sea Shepherd crew begin to cheer and jump for joy]
Stan
They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
Cartman
Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. [small plane engines are now heard. Cartman, Stan, and the others begin to look around]
Japanese Pilot
Bonzaaaaaaaai! [flies his plane right into a whale and blows up]
Stan
Jesus Christ! [Everyone looks around as more planes come in and take out the whales surrounding the boat. Two whales take a dive to deeper water, but two planes follow them under and blow up. The whales' corpses float up onto the water's surface.] We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
Woman 2
Look out! [four Japanes planes crash into the boat and blow it and themselves up. Once the smoke clears, the ocean is shown, filled with debris and carcasses. The crew of the Sea Shepherd is dead... Except for Cartman, Stan, and Kenny, who swim towards a piece of wood.]
Stan
[catching his breath] I, I can't, I can't believe it.
Cartman
Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales. [the Japanese boats pulls up to the boys' location and stops.] Uh oh.
Tokyo, day. The boys are in a prison cell. Cartman brings out a harmonica and starts playing it.
Cartman
Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.

Stan
Will you stop that?
Cartman
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
Stan
Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
Cartman
You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! [goes back to his song. Stan goes to the cell door and looks out]
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.
[a door opens somewhere and two prison guards walk towards the boys' cell]

Guard
Itte kure 'Akihito-sama irashaimasu!' ["... 'Welcome, Lord Akihito'!" The boys, not knowing Japanese, say nothing. The guards bow to the emperor]
Emperor Akihito
So, you are the ones who have been-a sinking our boats!
Stan
You speak English.
Emperor Akihito
You have caused us many problems, set us back many months!
Cartman
Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
Kenny
(Yeah, can we go?)
Emperor Akihito
[steps closer to the door] Why have you done this? Why do you insist on-a making trouble for the Japanese?!
Stan
Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
Emperor Akihito
[turns his back on the boys] You think you have the right to tell us what is okay?! I have-a something to show you!
The Hiroshima Peace Memorial, day. Emperor Akihito takes the boys on a tour of the memorial.
Emperor Akihito
This is Hiroshima. Over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb. We built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened. [Cartman yawns, Stan punches him on the right shoulder]
Cartman
What dude?
Inside the Memorial.
Emperor Akihito
At-a 8:15 a.m. the people of Hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all. [an atomic bomb is detonated] Women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated. [footage of bomb victims appears] Those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. Burns, radiation poisoning. For generations the radiation affected the victims. Japanese babies born without rimbs. Without eyes! [Cartman snickers. The emperor turns, folds his arms over his chest, and glares at him]
Cartman
Sorry. [clears his throat.] A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
Emperor Akihito
One hundred and forty thousand Japanese were killed by atom bomb. We have never recovered from the memory of that day. It is impossible for a nation to ever forgive an act so horrible. This-a picture shows the prane that dropped the bomb. [shows it to the boys] It was called the Enora Gay. And it was frown by the monsters who dropped the bomb that day. Dohfin, and Weiru! [the pilots are shown to be a dolphin and a whale. The emperor shakes with anger]
Stan
Ummm, where did you get that picture?
Emperor Akihito
The Americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. We were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with America. We will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! Fuck you. Fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!
Cartman
So that's what this has all been about?
Stan
Dude, it wasn't actually and dolphin and a whale who bombed Hiroshima. It was the-
Cartman
Zzzzt zzzzsssht! [whispers aloud] Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
Stan
Oh, right. Look, I... I think I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
Kyle's bedroom. He's working at his computer when the phone rings. He picks up his cell phone and answers.
Kyle
Hello? Stan?
Stan
Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
At the Prime Minister's office, later.
Stan
Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth. [pulls out a manila envelope and walks to the Prime Minister's desk] Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers. [hands the envelope to the Prime Minister, who opens it and pulls out the "unaltered" photo. The Prime Minister and the officials crowd in to look at the photo.] A chicken and a cow.
Emperor Akihito
Chicken and-a cow? Chicken and-a cow?!
Hatoyama
Chicken and cow use poor dohfin and weiru as-a scapegoat?! This is outrage! [pounds his desk]
A cow pasture. Cows go about grazing, minding their own business, when the Japanese return to the U.S., only now they're killing cows.
The Japanese
Fuck you cows!
A chicken coop. The Japanese converge on it and kill the chickens inside.
The Japanese
Teikara chickens!
Randy
[watches all this with Stan] Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.
End of Whale Whores

The F Word
A pond in a meadow. A hummingbird flits from flower to flower, then flies off as the camera zooms out to reveal the four boys there. Stan is fishing on one rock, Kenny is resting on another reading a magazine, Kyle stands near the water's edge, Cartman is sitting behind him on a third rock.
Cartman
Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
Stan
Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
Kyle
This... is exactly what I needed.
Kenny
(Meee toooo.) [a second later and the roar of motorcycles is heard, making the boys jump up startled. They look around]
Stan
Aww! Not those guys again! [the boys leave the pond and head over to the source of the noise - a group of bikers idling at at intersection for no other reason than to revel in the sound of their own bikes' motors]
Cartman
God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of assholes on their Harley motorcycles show up?! [the bikers just cheer each other on, but the motors drown them out]
Stan
God! Shut up!
Cartman
Piss off, you stupid assholes! [the bikers ride off]
A restaurant. The Marshes and the Broflovskis are dining al fresco.
Randy
Isn't this great food?
Gerald
You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
Randy
You know what's really interesting is that- [the bikers roar in and stop at a crosswalk at one end of the restaurant, which is called Café Monet, and rev their motors. After a few seconds they ride away] ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and they-
An outdoor wedding. Father Maxi presides.
Father Maxi
On this gorgeous day we bring these two together for the most important ta- [the bikers roar in and slow down. The guests and the bride glare at the bikers as they roll slowly by]
Lead Biker
Everybody's checking us out.
Biker 2
Yeah, they think we're pretty cool.
A diner. People go about their conversations. Among them, the bikers.
Lead Biker
Hooo! We were definitely turnin' some heads out there.
Biker 3
Yeah!
Biker 2
I was pullin' back on that throttle, and everybody was like, "What is that?"
Biker 4
Fer sure!
Biker 3
Yeah.
Biker 5
Hey- hey, nobody here is really paying attention to us.
Lead Biker
That's weird. [clears his throat and starts imitating a motorcycle engine. The other bikers follow suit, and a few of the patrons look at them] Oh yeah, that's better.
The diner's men's room. A biker approaches a urinal, unzips, and gets to work. He looks left, then he looks right, then he clears his throat and revs up with his voice until the patron at right looks at him. He turns to his left and does the same to the patron at left. That patron looks at him. Once he's sure both men are looking at him, he faces forward and finishes urinating.
The diner, outside. Its name is Ronny's Diner. The bikers stream out of there and get on their bikes.
Lead Biker
All right let's head out. [the others agree and begin to rev their voices as they board their bikes.]
Cartman
[walking into view] Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes! [the bikers quiet down, turn off their motors, and look at him] You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right?
Lead Biker
...What did you say?
Cartman
You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
Biker 6
...Hey man, we roll how we roll, and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it, that's too bad for them!
Biker 2
Yeah! [the bikers rev their voices again]
Cartman
No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. [proceeds to walk past the line of bikes]
Biker 7
Thah- that little boy just called us fags.
Biker 2
Like he didn't think we were cool.
Biker 6
But he's wrong. People don't think we're fags, do they?
Lead Biker
'Course he's wrong! And anyway, nobody except that little freak would ever say something like it to our faces!
Other Bikers
Yeah! Let's ride! [they rev up their voices and their motors] Let's go! Rev 'em up! [they ride off]
Kyle's house, Ike's room, day. Ike is playing with a toy xylophone when the bikers go down his street. He puts the xylophone sticks to his ears to block out the noise, but that doesn't work. He goes to his window, lifts it up and yells.
Ike
Fags! [then closes his window]
Biker 2
Did that kid just call us-?
Lead Biker
Ju-just ignore him! [as they ride, a car pulls up in front of them. Two kids in the back seat turn and make gestures to them. One of the boys makes a sign, then turns it around. Both kids hold it up. It says "FAGS." One of them mouths the word and the boys laugh.] God damn it, this is fucked up!
Biker 8
What's wrong with kids today? [revs his voice a little]
The desert. The lead biker is pretty bummed at the treatment the bikers have been getting.
Biker 4
It doesn't make any sense. They all called us fags.
Biker 6
How can they call us fags? I mean, listen to this? [revs his motor up]
Lead Biker
I know, I know! Look, guys, I think I know what the problem is here.
Biker 3
Really? You do?
Biker 9
Whatwhat?
Lead Biker
Yeah, think about it, guys. You see all the things kids have today? I mean, with their Xboxes and surround-sound entertainment systems, kids today are surrounded by big loud stuff all the time!
Biker 10
Hey, that's right.
Lead Biker
That's all it is, guys. We just need to get a little louder, that's all. [revs up his voice and his bike, and the others follow suit.]
The neighborhood park. The boys are playing basketball.
Kyle
Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
Cartman
But Cartman isn't letting up on him. [the bikers roll by and the boys stop playing]
Kyle
Oh, what the hell?! [the bikers roll by with a variety of musical instruments, a siren, and a rooster attached to their bikes, all of them making noise.]
Biker 6
Chicken spears! Chicken spears! Chicken spears! ...Chicken spears! Chicken spears!
Stan
God damn it God damn it!
Lead Biker
Oh yeah, now we're turnin' some heads! [blows into one of the two horns on his handlebars]
Biker 2
Let's see 'em call us fags now!
Stan's house, later. The boys present in the living room are the four boys, Token, Jimmy, Clyde, and Butters.
Stan
All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
Kyle
Yes.
Cartman
Agreed.
Jimmy
I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.
Stan
Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can- [the bikers roll by on Stan's street, then Stan sighs when they're gone] ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
Kyle
Sounds good.
Jimmy
Okay good, yeah.
Cartman
Ni-nice, okay.
Butters
What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
Cartman
What?
Butters
I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! "Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
Stan
...That makes perfect sense, Butters.
Butters
It does?
Stan
Yes, now get out of here.
Butters
Okay. [walks out]
Stan
Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
Cartman
I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
Stan
[taking notes] Oh that's good.
Cartman
[taking notes] Yeah, I think that'll be nice.
Stan
But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
Cartman
I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
Stan
Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
All
Yeah!
Ronny's diner, next morning. The bikers stream out of there and to their bikes.
Lead Biker
Now that was a good breakfast.
Biker 6
I'm full. [the bikers all rev their voices again and stand by their bikes...]
Lead Biker
[sniffs] You guys smell that? Smells like that new famous bowl at KFC.
Biker 6
Ohh, OHHH! Somebody took a shit on mah fuckin' Harley!
Biker 3
What?
Biker 2
Awwww, me too! I got shit all over my pants now! [another biker throws up on his Harley]
Biker 7
There's little flags stuck in the shit!
Lead Biker
[picks the flag off his Harley and reads it] "You're fags."
Biker 11
You've gotta be kidding me!
Lead Biker
Come on, we'll find the bastards who did this! [the bikers wipe the crap off their bikes, rev their voices and their bikes, hop on, and ride off. They stop at an intersection and look up at a billboard. It's a Harley-Davidson billboard, and on it is spray-painted "FAGS GET OUT." They cross the intersection and continue down the road, stopping again when three buildings next to each other have the same message spray-painted on them.]
Biker 12
This can't be happening. [they continue riding]
An alley. The boys reflect on their work.
Stan
Really nice work, guys.
Kyle
Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
A sidewalk nearby. Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave walk down the sidewalk hand in hand.
Big Gay Al
And so I said to the guy, "you really think I'm paying that much?"
Mr. Slave
Heheh, oh Jesus Christ. [both men stop and gasp at what they see: the same three buildings the bikers just passed, and the message spray-painted on it] Oh my God.
Big Gay Al
I thought we were past this.
South Park Elementary School gym. The mayor and city officials as well as Principal Victoria and Counselor Mackey address the student body.
Mayor McDaniels
Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, "Fags get out." Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-
Cartman
That was us!
Mayor McDaniels
...'Scuse me?
Stan
Yeah, we did that!
Kyle, Kenny
Yeah!
Mayor McDaniels
...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
Kyle
W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of our town.
Cartman
Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
Other Kids
Yeah, uh huh, I do, yep. [the students begin to murmur]
Mr. Mackey
Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!
Stan
Gay people?
Kyle
We aren't talking about gay people.
Mr. Mackey
You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!
Stan
Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
Cartman
Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
Kyle
Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
Mayor McDaniels
What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!
Stan
Aw crap!
South Park Public Library, day. A row of motorcycles is at the front door.
Lead Biker
Faggot, often shortened to fag, has been used in the English language since the late sixteenth century. Its original meaning was "an old or unpleasant woman".
Biker 2
That certainly don't apply to us.
Lead Biker
Faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks. And in the nineteenth century, a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood.
Biker 6
Well they certainly ain't calling us fags 'cause we gather sticks; there's got to be more! [begins revving his voice. The other bikers begin revving theirs, and the librarian shushes them. The bikers tone down their revving.]
Biker 2
What's that part say there?
Lead Biker
Later, the term "fag" was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried, and was often used as an insult to the elderly, as in calling them "baggage".
Biker 2
Fag was used as an insult to women, then poor people, then old people?
Lead Biker
In the early 1900s the word became a pe-jo-ra-tive term against homosexuals and transgender people in the United States.
Biker 10
Well that word just keeps changing its meaning. What's it got to do with us? [begins revving his voice. The other bikers begin revving theirs, and the librarian shushes them again. The bikers tone down their revving.]
A courtroom. A panel of judges is interrogating the four boys.
Judge 1
We are really trying to understand this. How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable?
Kyle
[exasperated] Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
Stan
Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.
Judge 2
I happen to be gay, boys. Do you think I'm a fag?
Stan
Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
Judge 2
No.
Stan
Then you're not a fag.
Judge 1
So what if a guy is gay and rides a Harley?
Cartman
Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
Stan
I don't know.
Kenny
(This is fucking ridiculous.)
Stan
All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
Judge 3
"Fag."
Stan
Right. But you're not thinkin' "Oh, he's a homosexual," you're thinkin' "Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider."
Judge 1
This, this is, making insanely good sense to me.
Judge 4
Alright, how about this: What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a Harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?
Cartman
You call them "bike-curious".
Judge 1
"Bike-cu-"
Stan
"Bike-curious"! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
Kenny
[puts his head in his hands out of frustration] (Jesus fucking Christ!)
The South Park Community Center, evening. Big Gay Al is holding a meeting there.
Big Gay Al
Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words "fag" and "faggot" are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders!
Mr. Slave
[clapping] Hear hear!
Big Gay Al
We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots!
Mr. Slave
Yes Jesus yes!
Channel Four News.
Announcer
This is Channel 4 Evening News.
News Anchor
A new movement in South Park is bringing to question the word "fag". Gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago.
Field Reporter
And what is your name, little boy?
Martin
Martin.
Field Reporter
Alright Martin, can you do me a favor? Could you point to the "fag" for me? [shows him a poster with two pictures on it - one of a biker, the other of of a man dressed in women's swimwear. The boy is unsure what to do] Just point to which one is the fag. [Martin finally steps up and points to the biker. The next clip is of the reporter asking a baby] All right now could you just point to the fag for me, little girl? Which one is a faggot? [holds up another poster with two different pictures on it - one of a biker, another of Liberace. The baby starts to lean to one side, and her mom moves her in that direction until the baby points to the biker.]
News Anchor
[shown are the Mayor and her aides, and Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave] Sparked by this realization and persuaded by a gay advocate group, the Mayor signed a new city ordinance today making the word "fag" officially refer to annoying inconsiderate Harley riders. [next she's shown in front of City Hall with an aide and the four boys]
Field Reporter
[interviewing the bikers] How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance?
Lead Biker
What did you say?
Field Reporter
Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag.
Lead Biker
Hey you know what? If you call me fag in my face one more time, you'd better-
Field Reporter
I already did it twice.
Lead Biker
Well I think that- I think that you uh, you probably won't say it again.
Field Reporter
I bet I do.
Lead Biker
Well okay, I-
Field Reporter
Fag. [the lead biker throws a punch, knocking the reporter down and cutting off the video feed]
News Anchor
[Randy is shown watering his lawn] As more people in South Park adapt to the new meaning... [the bikers roll down Randy's street. He turns to see them]
Randy
Fags! [turns back to water his lawn. The bikers look at him and move on. Next, Father Maxi is shown holding a sign in front of his church: "GOD HATES FAGS" as the bikers pass by]
News Anchor
...more and more Harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.
The neighborhood park. The boys are playing basketball again. Kenny takes a shot.
Cartman
Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. [Kenny gets the ball and throws it to Stan, who dribbles it a bit and gets ready to shoot]
Stan
Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
Kyle
I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
Mayor McDaniels
[runs up to the boys] You four turd balls in my office NOW!
Stan
Aw crap! [drops the basketball]
City Hall, the Mayor's office, day.
Mayor McDaniels
You have got me in a lot of trouble! [turns on the TV]
Another Mayor
The fact of the matter is that "fag" is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals, and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not! The town of South Park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world!
Mayor McDaniels
She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
Kyle
We're sorry, Mayor.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!
Stan
We can fix this!
Mayor McDaniels
HOW?!
Stan
That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
Cartman
Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
The desert, day. The bikers are gathered there again revving their voices and their motorcycles.
Lead Biker
Now I don't know about you, but I think this town is starting a trend. And if we let them officially change the meaning of "fag" from gay people to us, then soon every town might. [the bikers rev up their voices and bikes] If we don't do anything, we can end up trying to fight e- [one biker continues to rev up his voice and bike] If we don't do anything, we c-... Hey Bartlett. Bartlett! [stands in front of him] I'm trying to talk, you fag! [Bartlett is stunned, as are the other bikers] Aw, see? Now they got us doin' it to ourselves! We gotta put a stop to this now! [the bikers rev up their voices and bikes] We're going to ride into that town and kick some fuckin' ass! [the bikers rev up their voices and bikes]
City Hall, day. A stage has been set up. The four boys sit on the left side of the stage and the city seal takes up the center. People are taking pictures, an orchestra plays grandstand music leading into "Pomp and Circumstance". A banner over the stage reads: Welcome Dictionary Officiates.
Field Reporter
Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word "fag" will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, "fag" will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide.
Big Gay Al
You can do it, boys! We believe in you!
Field Reporter
And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived. [three officials walk up the red carpet, one of them holding the dictionary on its own pillow.] Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, Mr. Emmanuel Lewis. [shown in a gown following the three men]
Cartman
Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
Stan
Ohh, it all makes sense now. [the four men walk onto the right side of the stage. The crowd cheers and claps]
Emmanuel Lewis
To change... [the crowd falls silent] the definition of a word... is no trifling thing. I expect this proposal for changing the definition of the word "fag" to be both discerning and undisputable.
Big Gay Al
Come on boys, you can do it! [motorcycle engines are heard. A horde of bikers roars towards City Hall. Randy gets up and sounds the alarm]
Randy
Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! [everyone scatters as the bikers arrive and tear everything up. One of them throws a bottle bomb at a store, breaking a window and setting it on fire. A family nearby escapes injury. Three bikers ram their motorcycles into the stage]
Stan
There's fags everywhere!
Kyle
We gotta run! [the boys leave the stage quickly. A biker throws his chain towards the stage, catching Emmanuel Lewis by the right ankle and pulling him off the stage and down the street.]
Emmanuel Lewis
WAAAH! What nefariousness is this?! Ogh! You obdurate beast! [as the town falls into chaos, the boys run into an alley, but find that it has a dead end. The bikers gather at the alley's entrance and the lead biker walks up to the boys. The other bikers get off their Harleys and follow]
Lead Biker
[stops] Well well. Now, do you think we're fags?
Stan
[backing up as far as he can] Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. [the other boys do as well]
Kyle
Yeah. You definitely made your point.
Biker 13
No! We rolled in, kicked ass, and took shit over! Is that what a fag does?!
Stan
Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
Lead Biker
No, you're supposed to think we're not fags now!
Stan
But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
Kyle
I don't either.
Butters
[voice only] That's because you guys never understood! [walks through the crowd of bikers and past the lead biker] You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
Biker 14
Who is this little fag?
Butters
I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
Biker 15
That's it, let's kill them all!
Cartman
No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
Big Gay Al
[voice only] No one is killing anyone! [a sound of guns being cocked. The bikers turn to see who's at the alley entrance - Big Gay Al and his gay support group. One group member holds a sign - "GAYS AGAINST FAGS"] We've had enough! You faggots get the hell out of our town!
Lead Biker
[seeing no choice but to accept the word] All right everyone, all right. We are fags. Yeah, we're fags. We're total fags. And you know what? We like it.
Biker 2
Yeah, we like being fags.
Lead Biker
So go ahead, America. Whenever you pass by Harley riders like us, roll down your window, and yell "Faggots!" All you kids out there, when you see us, walk up to us, and say "Hello, fags." No, really, we want you to. At least we're cool enough to embrace who we are. Right guys?
Bikers
That's right. You got it. Yeah. [more of this, followed by revving voices and motors]
Biker 6
Come on, fags, let's roll out! [the bikers ride away. Emmanuel Lewis limps back onto the stage]
Stan
...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
Emmanuel Lewis
Let there be no perplexity: those individuals are the legitimate faggots. The definition shall be replaced. [everyone in town, even the homosexuals, cheer this change]
Stan
We did it! Yeah!
Kyle
Yeah! We did it, you guys! [he and Stan hug]
Cartman
Oh it's over, it's finally over! [he and Kenny do a shoulder embrace. Stan walks up to the camera]
Stan
Today, we've made history.
Fag (făg) n. 1. An extremely annoying, inconsiderate
person most commonly associated with Harley riders.
2. A person who owns or frequently rides a Harley.

End of The F Word

Dances with Smurfs
South Park Elementary, start of the school day. The chimes play as the fourth grader class pays attention. The following is all voice-over:
Gordon Stoltski
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements, Parent-teacher conferences begin next Thursday. If you have not yet done so, please turn in your parents' requested time sheets by the end of fifth period today. [Kindergarten class is shown, with a female teacher] Lunch today will be a choice of chicken tostadas or spaghetti with a marninara sauce and side salad. [Fourth grade class is shown again.] Attention fourth graders: the fall registration for glee club starts tomorrow. Any interested students should fill out a- [a door is heard being kicked in] Whoa, what's going on?
Intruder
I'll killl you! [the class pays closer attention] I swear to God I'll kill you!
Gordon
Who are you?!
Intruder
I'm the man who's gonna put a bullet between your eyes!
Gordon
Hey! He's got a gun!
Intruder
You little bastard! You fucked my wife! You think I wouldn't find out?!
Gordon
Sir, please, I don't know you.
Intruder
Yeah, right!
Man
All right, what the hell is going on around here? You sir need to leave this area- [two gun shots are heard and the man is heard falling with a thud]
Gordon
Oh God, he shot him!
Intruder
Ya had to push me, didn't ya?! NOW YOU!
Gordon
HAAAAAAAAAA! Sir, I truly don't know- [punch] th-AAAAA! AAAA!
Intruder
There! How's it feel, huh?!
Gordon
[shrieking] Please, I don't know you! Uughuh!
Intruder
You're Gordon Stoltski, right?! Truck driver from Chicago?!
Gordon
No, I'm Gordon Stoltski, third grader who reads the morning announcements!
Intruder
Yeah, right! We'll see if that's true. Go on, read the morning announcements!
Gordon
SOMEBODY HELP ME!
Intruder
I said do it! [smack]
Gordon
AAAAA! AAAAA! AAAAAAAAAA! AAA! Any, any interested students should fill out an applicant survey [smack] WAA! WAAAAAAAAAA!
Intruder
I knew you were lyin'! That was terrible! Now put your mouth over the barrel of this gun!
Gordon
No please! I'm so scared! [more softly] I'm so scared!
Intruder
DO IT!
Gordon
Please! I'll duh, I'll do whatever you say! Here! Here I see! Here! [his voice gets muffled] I got my mouth on the ba- [the gun goes off and Gordon falls on the floor]
Intruder
Look at you now. We're all dead. [shoots himself]
His memorial service in the school gymnasium, day. Mr. Mackey presides over it.
Mr. Mackey
We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even though we now know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.
Cartman
Oh. My. Goodddd.
Mr. Mackey's office, day. A sign on the door reads "Morning Announcement Tryouts" Cartman and another kid wait on chairs next to the door.
Cartman
Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
Mike
Yeah, I think it would be really fu-fu-fu-fun, and ru-ru-ru-rurrraise my self es-es-esesesteem.
Mr. Mackey
[cracks the door open and looks out] Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. [Mike gets off the chair and enters the office.]
Cartman
[cackles] He stutters like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag! [another boy walks up and sits in the chair to Cartman's right. Cartman notices immediately: the boy is well-dressed] Who are you?
Casey Miller
My name is Casey Miller, and I'm in the third grade. [Cartman is awed] Ever since I can remember people have told me I should read their morning announcements. My friends always said to me, "Dear Casey, your voice is like butter to our ears. Could you please find a way to get that audible chocolate on the airwaves?" Well, here I am, and hopefully I'll be the kid with the job. [Cartman is mad now and gives him a hard look]
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?
Casey
I'm tryin' out and dryin' out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay. Eric, you wanna go next? [Cartman gets off his chair and walks into the office, keeping his eyes on Casey until the door closes]
Mr. Mackey's office, inside. Mr. Mackey and Cartman sit on two chairs opposite each other.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.
Cartman
Mr. Mackey, what's a moronic jizzrag?
Mr. Mackey
What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!
Cartman
Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece? [Mr. Mackey opens his office door to yell at Casey]
Mr. Mackey
Get lost, you little dirtball!
Casey
Excuse me?
Mr. Mackey
I said take a hike!
Casey
I don't understand... what I did wrong.
Mr. Mackey
Beat it, you're not gettin' the job! [Casey gets off his chair and walks away]
South Park Elementary, morning. The fourth grade class is shown as the intercom comes on.
Cartman
Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed in to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well. [reads the next announcement] For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger! [Wendy's mouth drops open] Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia! [Clyde has gone to sleep, half the class is getting sleepy, Stan buries his head in his arms] It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
Butters
Oh jeez!
Cartman
But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
Kyle
Will somebody shut him up?
The principal's office, after the announcements. Cartman walks into the office. Mr. Mackey stands to Principal Victoria's left.
Cartman
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
Principal Victoria
The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.
Cartman
Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
Principal Victoria
No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
Cartman
Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
Mr. Mackey
Well, because he was being murdered.
Cartman
You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
Principal Victoria
All we ask is you keep it shorter.
Cartman
Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
South Park Elementary, morning. Cartman is back at the announcement desk. He's smiling, and clears his throat. Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, and two school district officials look on.
Cartman
Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field. [The first or second grade class is shown] I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions. [next day] Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school- [next day] And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' "Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that." [next day] I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.
Cartman leads the school in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.
Third Graders
I pledge allegiance to the flag -
Cartman
- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
Kindergartners
- a socialist dunghole...
South Park Elementary, morning. Cartman is back at the announcement desk.
Cartman
Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class, [The lights go down and a monitor is shown above Mr. Garrison's desk] you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
Kyle
Oh God, no! [Cartman has made his own graphic introduction full of poses]
Cartman
Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again. [exhales forcefully] Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back. [leaves his desk and walks over to a mobile blackboard] So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.
Ike
[upset to the fact] NOOO!
Cartman
I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why [writes Y on the board], we're gonna transform into something.
South Park Elementary, school hallway, day. Wendy is at her locker when Butters approaches with a group of friends. We'll call them Melvins, after the group he formed with Dougie and Pip back in Season 3.
Butters
Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
Wendy
Is what true?
Butters
That you hate Smurfs?
Wendy
I don't have time for this.
Butters
Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
Melvins
Yeah, that's right. We can ask. [Casey is among them]
Wendy
Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
Butters
[gasps and points] It is true!
Melvin 1
Oh my God!
Melvin 2
Yeah, bemememe!
Melvin 3
Oh my God!
Wendy
Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! [storms off]
Butters
What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
Casey
Hyeah.
Melvin 1
That was cool.
Melvin 4
Awesome.
Melvin 2
Yeah, that was cool.
Melvin 3
Yeah, great job.
The cafeteria entrance, day. To one side is a huge poster on the wall and a smaller sign near a desk at which sits Cartman signing copies of his new book, "What Happened To My School?"
Cartman
"Thank you" and this is to..?
Douglas
Douglas.
Cartman
[signs a copy] "To Douglas." There you go. [gives it to him] Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
Butters
Hey Eric!
Cartman
Well hello. Another person who [looks to his right and tries to get the other kids' attention as they stream into the cafeteria] cares about the future of our school?
Butters
Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
Cartman
Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
Butters
Cool, thanks.
Cartman
That'll be five dollars.
Butters
[a bit disappointed] Oh, okay. [hands him a five-dollar bill]
Stan
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
Cartman
A book signing.
Stan
I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
Cartman
I do not directly say she's a slut!
Stan
"Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"!
Cartman
[leans over the table and points somethoug out to him] You didn't read the rest, dude.
Stan
"Or does she?"
Cartman
"Or does she?" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
Butters
[showing up with his Melvins] Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!
Some younger boys are reading the book.
Boy 1
"Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?" [the other boys react to that passage]
Stan
Hey hey, stop reading that!
Boy 1
Wull what do you mean?
Stan
Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
Boy 2
Yes it does!
Casey
Eric Cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders. We should all ask if our president is a penis-hungry hooker with a huge vagina. I'm Casey Miller. [Stan turns and walks away. He sees Wendy at her locker and approaches her.]
Stan
Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
Wendy
I really don't care, Stan.
Stan
Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
Wendy
I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! [takes up her backpack and storms off]
The principal's office, after the announcements. Cartman walks into the office. Mr. Mackey stands to Principal Victoria's left.
Cartman
You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
Principal Victoria
Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
Cartman
Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
Mr. Mackey
Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
Cartman
And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
Mr. Mackey
Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
Cartman
Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
Principal Victoria
[stands up] Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!
Cartman
Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! I'm walking out and I'm never coming back! [turns and storms out of the office.]
South Park Elementary, next morning. The students are entering the school. Later...
Announcer
[an adult male] Live, from the principal's office, these are the morning announcements. Here, is Eric Cartman.
Cartman
Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being allowed to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs. [an animated sequence begins. Smurf Village is shown] I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust. [one day he steps up, and they gather round him] It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. [they bring him a cap big enough to fit his head, he puts it on and grins. The camera pans up and the title of his animation appears: Dances with Smurfs]
Butters
Whoa... [this time Kyle is the one who has his head in his arms]
Cartman
The smurfs and I grew to understand each other. [Cartman is now dressed as a Smurf, but only his face is painted blue. He's harvesting berries with the Smurfs] They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette. [He and the diminutive Smurfette sit on a log watching the sun set] We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
Kyle
"These, are the morning announcements." [Butters shushes him and he buries his face in his arms again.]
Cartman
Papa Smurf was displeased at first, [Cartman tries to catch up to Smurfette as her father takes her into their mushroom house] He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
Cartman Smurf
No! No, you must leave the noble Smurfs alone! Who's behind all this?! [gasps at the sight of lots of bulldozers ready to raze Smurfland, and at their forewoman] I should have known. Wendy!
Human Wendy
[just Cartman dressed as Wendy] Out of my way! [this Wendy has padding to make her appear to have breasts]
Cartman Smurf
Wendy, what are you doing here?!
Human Wendy
Smurfberries are worth a lot of money. With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for the entire year.
Cartman Smurf
Wendy, I know you're president of our school, but you can't just dig up the Smurfs' land!
Human Wendy
Fuck the Smurfs! They can suck my fat tits! [she climbs onto one of the bulldozers, Cartman stands in front of it]
Cartman Smurf
How many Smurfberries is enough, Wendy?!
Human Wendy
You can suck my fat tits too! [steps on the gas and the bulldozer begins to move. She rolls over the land, mowing down trees, mushroom houses, and smurfs, killing them by the tens. Blood and guts splatter everywhere]
Cartman Smurf
Smurfette noooo!
Human Wendy
Suck mah fat tits!
Cartman
And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs! [Butters sobs] Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD. [holds up the DVD case] The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
South Park Elementary hallway, later. Butters is pacing the ground before a group of Melvins.
Butters
That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
A Melvin
I can no longer stand idly by.
Butters
We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
Casey
It is time for that slutty Smurf-killing bitch to get what's comin' to 'er.
Melvins
Yeah!
Butters' house, after school. He's at the back patio talking to the Melvins over a megaphone. All of them are wearing shirts Cartman had made: "I ask questions!" with a picture of Cartman's head underneath.
Butters
I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it! [the Melvins cheer] So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! [the Melvins cheer again, and follow him out the side gate and on to Wendy's house]
Butters stops his posse outside Wendy's house, on the sidewalk.
Butters
Let us not forget what happens this day!
A Melvin
Do it!
Butters
We are here, Wendy Testaburger! [walks up to her front door, drops his pants and briefs, and pees on the front door.]
Melvin 2
Take that, school president!
Melvin 3
Get her good!
Butters
I am.
Wendy
[opens her window] Hey, what are you doing?
Butters
The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
Mr. Testaburger
[opens the front door and looks down] What the hell? [Butters stops peeing and looks up]
Butters
Wah! [turns and waddles down the steps without pulling his pants up, then across the front yard] Smurfkiller! [runs down the street with the other Melvins] Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
Mr. Testaburger
Wendy, did a boy just pee on our door because the Smurfs were murdered? [Wendy plants her hands on her face, then removes them]
Wendy
It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.
The Principal's office, next morning. Wendy and Cartman are on Cartman's set as his make-up people prepare him for the Announcements. One of them is Esther. They frost the lower part of his hair to give him a distinguished elderly look.
Cartman
Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
Wendy
Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.
Cartman
People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
Wendy
If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
Cartman
Of course. That's why we're here.
A Boy
Five seconds. [the make-up people move out as Cartman stands up]
Cartman
Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you. [sits down and gets his notes ready as the chimes come in] Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
Wendy
Sure.
Cartman
Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
Wendy
Okay.
Cartman
How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? [Wendy doesn't answer, and Cartman studies her reaction]
Wendy
I don't, I, I have no idea what-
Cartman
You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
The Audio Video Department room. Butters and the Melvins are watching the announcements there.
Butters
Ohhh, he's got her now!
The Fourth Grade classroom. Kyle again has his face in his arms.
Cartman
Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
Wendy
I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
Cartman
If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? [Wendy doesn't answer]
The Audio Video Department room.
Butters
She's speechless!
Cartman
You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
Wendy
Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.
Cartman
Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
Wendy
What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?
Cartman
What? What do you mean I know that?
Wendy
I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?
Cartman
No! You wiped them all out!
Wendy
[gets off her chair and walks around a bit] Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!
Cartman
Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
Wendy
No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.
Mr. Garrison's classroom.
Stan
What?!
The Principal's office.
Wendy
And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
The AV Department room.
Butters
All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
A Melvin
I'm confused.
The Principal's office.
Cartman
Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
Wendy
No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.
Cartman
No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
Wendy
Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.
Cartman
You sold the movie rights to who?!
Wendy
James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
Cartman
Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
The Bijou. Playing there now is Avatar, James Cameron's latest movie. Cartman comes out of the 4:30 showing really pissed off.
Cartman
[crossing the street] Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes! [turns around and rants at the theater] You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA! [gives the theater two middle fingers three times] You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! [gives the theater two middle fingers three more times]
South Park Elementary, next morning. The fourth graders take their seats. Cartman comes in and takes his seat, still angry.
Cartman
Huh!
Stan
Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
Cartman
No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
Kyle
Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
Cartman
I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! [the chimes come on]
Casey
The sun is up and the birds are chirping. I'm Casey Miller and these, are the morning announcements. I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Falner. Brian writes, "Dear Casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? My desk is broken, and so far Eric Cartman has done nothing about it. Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy?" Well Brian, I couldn't agree more. Our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake.
Cartman
I'm doin' the best I can! [begins to cry, leaves his desk, and runs out of the classroom bawling.]
End of Dances with Smurfs

Pee
On the road, day. Cartman is singing. Jimmy looks over the back of the second row of seats in the station wagon.
Cartman
We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park!
We're going to the water park,
Me and all my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like!
[Kyle flashes a look of anger at him]

Stan
[annoyed] Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. [his father Randy is driving. The other boys present are Butters and Kenny]
Cartman
This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
Butters
What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
Cartman
No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
Jimmy
W-What are you talking about, Eric?
Cartman
You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
Stan
We're here! It's the water park! [Randy pulls up at the front entrance and drops the boys off.]
Pi Pi's Splashtown. The boys gather at the entrance.
Randy
I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at 4:00, you got it?
Cartman
Come on, let's go!
Stan
We got it, Dad.
The ticket booth.
Cartman
[hands the clerk some money] Six adorable children, please.
Inside. Cartman runs in and through the interactive fountains.
Cartman
Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool! [finally gets to the wave pool, but gets pissed off] Oh, what the hell?! [the pool is quite crowded with people of all races enjoying themselves. The other five boys catch up to Cartman]
Kyle
All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
Stan
Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
Cartman
[with a stunned look on his face] Forget it! Just forget it! [walks off in anger. The other five are confused]
Pi Pi's New York Splash. The boys tackle that attraction. Cartman isn't with them.
Stan
Dude, this is awesome.
Kyle
You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
Butters
[stops] Hey fellers, fellas hang on! I've gotta go to the bathroom. [Kenny continues across the pool without the other boys]
Kyle
Okay, go ahead. [turns back to Stan and Jimmy]
Butters
Okay, thanks. [goes to the bathroom right there, no stepping out of the pool or nothin']
Kyle
I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
Stan
Okay.
Kyle
All right, [glances back at Butters] check it out, I- [looks back again and sees what happened.] Butters, BUTTERS! What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
Butters
You said "go ahead".
Stan
Come on Kyle, let's check out the fireboats.
Kyle
No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
Stan
Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
Butters
Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
Kyle
No they don't!
Stan
Yeah, they do, Kyle.
Jimmy
To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tu-tu-twenty five seconds ago.
Kyle
Dude!
Stan
Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
Kyle
NO!
In another part of the park, Cartman stands alone near a gazebo as people move past him this way and that. Montage, part 1: Cartman is now in the wave pool, then he wanders around the park, then he's singing at a signpost, then he's back near the wave pool, looking at the crowd in there, then he faces the camera, then he walks back to the park entrance, then tugs at a cop's shirt only to find that the copy is a member of a minority group, then he's back at the signpost, then he's at an artificial beach looking for a place to sit, then he's in line for Pele's Revenge, then he's annoyed and lazing about in an inner tube at the Lazy River, then he's waiting to enter the Lost River of the King Tut.
Cartman
What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go oooooon.

There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.

There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!

At the Zip Line Ride. Cartman is waiting for the car he's in to start moving.
Ride Operator
Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-
Cartman
Just do it in English!
Back to the montage. Cartman walks around some more, then he's back at the wave pool looking at it, then some colored lights in the background, then he's on bended knee on a bluff overlooking the park.
Cartman
There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park

(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).

Pi Pi's Snack Shack, later. The other five boys are eating hamburgers.
Stan
After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
Butters
You bet!
Kyle
I'm not getting back in the water.
Stan
Aw come on, Kyle.
Kyle
Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
Stan
Not everybody pees in pools.
Kyle
Do you pee in the pool?
Stan
Not today... yet.
Kyle
Aw, come on!
Stan
Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
Kyle
Most likely.
Cartman
[running up to the boys] You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
Stan
Dude, where have you been?
Cartman
I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? And there are a hundred and ninety black people!
Kyle
So what?
Cartman
So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
Kyle
Well then they're not minorities, are they?
Cartman
...What do you mean?
Kyle
Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
Cartman
The black and brown people.
Kyle
No, you're the minority!
Cartman
Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's a fifty percent rise in one, year!
Stan
This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
Cartman
Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
Butters
The who?
Cartman
The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
Stan
I'm gonna go on the slides.
Butters
Whoopie! [Stan, Butters, Jimmy, and Kenny take their leave]
Cartman
You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on! [only Kyle is left at the table, and Cartman remembers this and slowly turns to him] Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan's prediction from coming true, buddy?
Kyle
Blow it out your ass, Cartman! [leaves the table without taking a bite from his hamburger. He walks by an elderly couple in a pool]
Woman
Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?
Eugene
Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything.
Kyle
Eewww! [walks away quickly. Nearby, a man takes a water sample]
Water Tester
Oh my God.
The park's main office. The water tester and his assistant are at the office with Pi-Pi and a lawyer. Behind Pi-Pi is a picture window, and outside that is the Drop Zone!! attraction.
Pi-Pi
Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi-Pi. How can I help you?
Assistant
Pi-Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park.
Water Tester
I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now 98% pee.
Pi-Pi
Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?
Assistant
Pi-Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty three percent. [with some urgency] You have to shut down.
Pi-Pi
What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggest-a weekend. Everyone is having a-theh fun.
Water Tester
You're endangering people's lives! [shows him the test results] If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!
Lawyer
And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?
Water Tester
One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!
Pi-Pi
Gehntlemen, please-a. I come-a from ada Venice. [shows off a real life picture of a canal in Venice] Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee.
Water Tester
You have to evacuate people now!
Lawyer
He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!
Water Tester
[now at the door with his assistant about to leave] If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands. [they leave]
The wave pool, later. The water is now green.
Butters
Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
Stan
This is sweet, huh Kenny? [Kenny, who's facing away from the camera, doesn't say anything. A girl in an inner tube floats past the boys, then stops and lets loose some pee. Sure enough, the ground begins to rumble and shake.]
Jimmy
W-What's that? [Explosions of pee come out of every ride, overrunning them all. A huge pee wave rises over the park and swamps it, destroying every structure. An unlucky slider is swept down in a rush of pee. A woman loses her baby as the wave strikes her back. The pee tsunami sweeps across the Mt. Everest attraction. A statue of a man scaling the mountain falls off]
Woman Who Loses Baby
(shrieks)
Man 1
It's pee! [turns to run from it]
Man 2
Look out for the pee! [Kyle, who's playing a Zombie Fighter video game, looks back to see what's all the commotion. The pee-nami hits the New York Splash attraction, mowing down its structures]
Kyle
Aaaaah! GROSS! [leaves the game and makes a run for it. A volcano blows up and chunks of lava drop all over the place. The wave pool gets unstable, threatening to throw people out with its wild waves]
Pi-Pi
[holding on to the sign post] Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee! [the sign post breaks off and both man and post are swept away by the pee. Stan, Butters, and Jimmy climb up the Mr. Everest sign]
Floating Woman
[swept away] Aaaah!
Stan
[in a shaky voice] Aaaah! [stops and looks at the pee, and sees a familiar boy floating in the water, face down] OH MY GOD, THEY KILLED KENNY!
Kyle
[running up some stairs in Drop Zone!!] Aw, sick! [the pee below him is rising]
Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot, some time later. Firefighters have arrived on scene of the destroyed water park.
Fire Marshal
I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers. [Randy quickly arrives in his station wagon and runs up to the captain]
Randy
What's going on?
Fire Marshal
I told you people to keep civilians back!
Randy
Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
Fire Marshal
We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-
Officer 1
Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. [the water tester and his assistant walk into view]
Water Tester
We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable.
Fire Marshal
So this is all pee-related.
Water Tester
Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning.
Fire Marshal
And?
Water Tester
It was almost all pee, no H.
Randy
Oh my God. I've gotta help him! [starts to run to the gate, but the captain catches him and pulls him back.]
Fire Marshal
Stay BACK!
Randy
You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
Officer 2
Sir, it's possible with a crane we could help any survivors out.
Water Tester
I think that would be a very bad idea.
Fire Marshal
And why is that?
Water Tester
Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change.
Fireman 1
Change how?
Water Tester
All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey. [a researcher wheels in a monkey who's been shackled to a dolly] We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch. [unzips his pants and turns to face the monkey, then starts peeing on it. He first pees on the chest, no reaction. He moves the stream up to the monkey's face and the monkey begins to protest. The monkey tries to escape the pee stream, but the tester just keeps the stream on it as best he can.]
Fire Marshal
My God! He's become full of rage!
Back in the pee-filled water park, Jimmy, Butters, and Stan stand on the Mt. Everest attraction. Kyle is on what remains of the Drop Zone!! sign, but it moves a little, sinking a bit.
Kyle
Aahhh...
Stan
[on a small plateau on the attraction] Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
Kyle
No way!
Jimmy
You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.
Butters
Come on, Kyle!
Kyle
Dude, that's all pee!
Stan
Well if you don't swim in it you're gonna die!
Kyle
I'll die if I do swim in it!
Stan
Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
Kyle
Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
Stan
[hesitantly] ...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
Kyle
WHAT?
Stan
Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.
Kyle
You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
Stan
Not... all the time.
Kyle
That is gross!!
Stan
Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
Butters
Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! [the sign drops further into the yellow urine]
Stan
Kyle, come on!
Kyle
Ah, goddamnit! [climbs down the sign and into the pee. He holds his face high up as much as he can as he swims across] Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, [He climbs up and joins his friends on the plateau. He pants, dripping with pee]
Butters
Do you need to wash your hands?
The lake of pee. Cartman hangs on to a styrofoam ice chest.
Cartman
Help! Help!
Man 1
Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! [a branch hangs off a Floom Zoom boat]
Cartman
Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me! [grabs onto the branch and is hoisted onto the boat. He catches his breath] Oh, oh, oh. [sits up and looks around - it's all minorities in the boat]
Man 2
Are you okay?
Cartman
Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
Man 2
Well what are we gonna do now?
Woman 1
We've gotta just wait it out.
Woman 2
Yeah, but for how long?
Man 3
We need to find somethin' to paddle with.
Cartman
[pulls out a memo pad and pen and writes the following] Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what's on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live. [puts the pad and pen away somewhere...] Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. [the other survivors just look at him]
The Marsh house. Sharon is on the phone in the living room while Shelly looks on from the kitchen doorway.
Sharon
Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
Randy
It's the pee! It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
Sharon
What is all pee?
Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot.
Randy
Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
Sharon
What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!
Randy
I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
Sharon
Randy, you've got to do something!
Randy
Calm down, Sharon, all right?! [shakes his head vigorously] Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.
Fire Marshal
[on the phone with someone] I said keep the media out! If the public hears about this we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands! [hangs up] Damn it where is that antidote?!
Researcher 1
[with red hair] Here! Here! We think we have it, sir! [three researchers walk into view] It's the best we could come up with in such a short time! We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine.
Fire Marshal
All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys! [three monkeys are wheeled in on dollies]
Water Tester
Let's hope to Christ this works. [each researcher takes a monkey and injects it with the antidote. Then they start pissing on the monkeys, and the monkeys protest almost immediately] No, damn it, no!
Fire Marshal
They're still angry.
Researcher 1
This one's really angry.
Fire Marshal
It's out of control! [quickly takes a gun from a police officer and shoots the middle monkey first, then the one on the left, then the one on the right. All of them die.] Find an antidote that works! [the researchers leave]
Stan, Jimmy, Kyle, and Butters make their way down the Mt. Everest attraction as the pee recedes.
Kyle
Dude, why the hell aren't people coming to help us?
Stan
I don't know. [they hear the sobs of a crying man nearby]
Pi-Pi
Why? Why didn't Pi-Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi-Pi, but-a the Pi-Pi not-a belieeve them. [sobs some more. The boys approach him]
Stan
Who are you?
Pi-Pi
[stands up and faces them] Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee.
Kyle
Yeah, well people should [looks at Stan and Butters] know that peeing in pools is [looks at Jimmy] bad!
Pi-Pi
But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi-Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open it, all this pee can be lowered.
Jimmy
Okay. W-where's the maintenance room?
Pi-Pi
That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi-Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? [Stan, Butters and Jimmy all look at Kyle, who looks back at them]
Kyle
No!
Butters
You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
Kyle
Not in pee!
Pi-Pi
[grabs Kyle by the left wrist and pulls him away from his friends] Please-a you have to hurry! [lets go] I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower.
Kyle
[looks back at the other boys] Oh who pees in the shower?!
Stan
...Well, it's not like if you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
Butters
Well yeah, seeing all that running water always makes me need to pee.
Kyle
You don't pee in the shower, dude. That's fucking disgusting!
Pi-Pi
Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!
Kyle
Jesus Christ!
Adrift in the Floom Zoom on Pi Pi Lake. Cartman whips out his memo pad and starts writing again.
Cartman
It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is "Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... [imagines himself in class with a bunch of non-white students]
Teacher
[A black man] All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report.
Cartman
I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
Teacher
Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!
Cartman
...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
Teacher
Good.
Cartman
Noooo... [now imagines himself at a job interview] Trying to find a job will be even harder.
Señor Lopez
You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?
Cartman
Well, I do just as much work.
Señor Lopez
[laughs] You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.
Cartman
Noooo... [now imagines himself at an open council meeting] Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
Councilman
All those in favor of putting white people in camps?
Audience
Aye!
Councilman
All those opposed?
Cartman
Noooo...
Councilman
The minorities win! [Cartman comes out of his daydream]
Cartman
[throws down his pad and pen and stands up] NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! [turns away and squeezes his eyes shut.]
The Mt. Everest attraction. Pi-Pi prepares Kyle for the descent to the basement. Kyle holds a piece of white paper and an index card.
Pi-Pi
Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi-Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.
Kyle
Let's just get this over with!
Pi-Pi
You've got-a the map and-a Pi-Pi's instructions?
Kyle
Yes.
Pi-Pi
Good-a. Now just one last thing. [takes a glass sitting next to him and scoops some pee into it] You need to drink-a some pee.
Kyle
What?!
Pi-Pi
You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.
Kyle
Why?!
Pi-Pi
You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate.
Stan
That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
Kyle
I am not, not, d-rinking pee!
Pi-Pi
But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!
Stan
Just drink the pee, Kyle.
Butters
Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.
Pi-Pi
What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!
Kyle
That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
Pi-Pi
Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.
Kyle
No!
Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot, afternoon.
Water Tester
Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata.
Researcher 2
[balding, with gray hair] Wait, you mean a banana.
Water Tester
Yes.
Fire Marshal
Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey! [another monkey is brought forth strapped to a dolly] All right, Connors. [Officer connors offers a banana to the monkey, who takes a bite of it after a few seconds. A researcher steps up and starts peeing on the monkey. The monkey doesn't mind it, but just takes another bite of the banana.]
Fireman 2
Holy God, it works!
Police Captain
All right, let's start moving in, everyone! Check the-
Water Tester
Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.
Randy
I'll do it. [the officers and firefighters make way for Randy.] You can test the antidote on me. [two researchers take Randy and sit him down in the dolly, then strap him in.]
Fire Marshal
[walks up to Randy] You sure you want to do this?
Randy
Give me the banana. [the balding researcher walks to him and gives him the banana. Randy takes a bite. The fire marshal unzips his pants and starts peeing on Randy] Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh. [tries his best to keep his cool, but shakes his head] Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.
Researcher 3
He looks agitated...
Randy
Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.
Fire Marshal
He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun! [Stevens moves to hand his gun to the fire marshal]
Randy
No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
Water Tester
He's all right!
Fireman 3
The banana worked!
The Mt. Everest attraction. Kyle is still up top holding the glass of pee, not daring to drink it.
Stan
Come on, dude!
Kyle
I'm thinking about it!
Jimmy
Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.
Pi-Pi
There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW! [Kyle begins to drink it, then stops]
Kyle
Gah, ah. [swallows once more] Gaagh.
Pi-Pi
Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.
Butters
You can do it, Kyle!
Kyle
Aaahh. Well- [gulps down the rest of the glass and throws the glass away] AAAAH! [the glass breaks on a boulder off screen]
Pi-Pi
All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a- [some helicopters are heard approaching]
Butters
[points to them] Hey look! [the helicopters are shown. Randy looks out from one of them]
Randy
[waving a small red show] Stan! [steps aside so the firefighters can drop down a rope ladder]
Stan
All right, they finally came for us. [he, Butters and Jimmy have wide smiles]
Kyle
[pissed off] Are you fucking kidding me?! [more rope ladders drop down from the other helicopters as the rescuers cheer]
Pi Pi's Splashtown parking lot, afternoon. Paramedics check out the survivors. The camera pans right to show Randy walking with Kyle, Stan, Jimmy, and Butters.
Randy
[stops] Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. [walks away]
Cartman
Guys? Guys! [walks into view and hugs Stan] Oh it's true! You all did survive!
Butters
Hawww, you lived?
Cartman
Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
Kyle
That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot.
Cartman
It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
Kyle
Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
Stan
Aw come on. It was just a little pee, Kyle.
Kyle
Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
Water Tester
All right everyone, quick! Here you go!
Butters
What's this?
Fire Marshal
You all need to eat your banana immediately!
Kyle
What the hell for?!
Stevens
[cocks his gun and aims at Kyle] Eat the banana or we have to put you down!
Kyle
[frustrated] AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!
End of Pee

Sexual Healing
Windermere Florida, Thanksgiving night, 2009, 2:15 am. There's fighting inside a mansion as a couple screams at each other
Man
Put it down, you bitch!
Mansion, inside. The camera is focused on the dining room table and slowly pulls back. A golf club strikes a dirty dish and smashes it apart
Man
Put the golf club down, you crazy bitch! [it's Tiger Woods, cowering behind a chair]
Woman
[smashes some more dishes] You motherfucker! I never should have married you! [Elin, with a bad Swedish accent]
Tiger
You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow!
Elin
Then why-a the fuck are you getting a text-a message from some-a low-life-a hooker on Thanksgiving?!
Tiger
God, shut up! [runs out of the dining room] Shut! Up! [enters his den and starts rummaging through a drawer] Where are my fucking pills?! [finds them, takes a bunch, and swallows them]
Elin
Oh yeah! Take more vitamins, Tiger! That'll help!!
Tiger
Will you just listen to me?!
Elin
Listen to this-a! [runs up to him and whacks him across the face as he turns to face her, leaving a bleeding gash across his right cheek]
Tiger
[winces] Aaaah! [looks at her] You fucking whore!
Outside the front door. Tiger leaves the house and goes to his SUV, wiping himself clean. Elin follows him to the front door
Elin
Oh where the fuck do ya think-a you're going?!
Tiger
I'm getting the fuck away from you! [opens the drivers' side door and gets in the SUV. Elin approaches that door with the club. Tiger starts the engine, and Elin starts swinging at the left rear door]
Elin
Open the door, you motherfucker! [Tiger peels away]
A videogame store. Cartman and Kenny are playing a golf game featuring Tiger and Elin. The preceding scenes were from that game
Cartman
[playing as Tiger] Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle walk into the store and spot the other two boys]
Stan
What are you guys doing?
Cartman
Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. [onscreen, Elin is chasing the SUV and leaving cracks in the rear windows with each swing of the club]
Tiger
D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!
Cartman
Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! [Cartman loses control of the SUV, which hits a fire hydrant, then a tree. Elin catches up to the SUV as Tiger opens the door and staggers out, a bit dazed. The radiator is letting out steam]
Tiger
Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch!
Elin
It serves you right, you cheating turd! [swings at him and misses]
Cartman
Oh dude, was that a combo move?
Kenny
(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)
Cartman
Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
Kyle
Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
Cartman
Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
Center for Disease Control and Prevention - the CDC - day. A table full of experts and doctors is assembled on the top floor
Chairman
I've gathered you together here because you are the best minds our country has to offer. As you've all seen on the news, our country is facing a major crisis, and we need to find out what's causing it. [the men glance at each other] Why? Why are rich successful men suddenly going out and trying to have sex with lots of women?
Expert 1
[with mustache and black coat] Tiger Woods was only the most prevalent, but our data shows that the numbers are growing. David Letterman and before that, Bill Clinton. There's a pattern here, people.
Expert 2
[with mustache and midnight blue coat] Why would a man who's famous and makes tons of money use that and have sex with lots of different women? [glances at the woman to his left, then looks ahead again]
Chairman
[stands up] Aand these rich celebrities have perfectly good wives at home. Why would they even think of sex with others? Dammit! [pounds the table with his right fist, but manages only a soft blow] I want answers!
Expert 3
[balding, with lab coat] We believe that it may be an outbreak of sex addiction, sir.
Chairman
[sits down] Sex awhowho?
Expert 4
[glasses and lab coat] It's a new phenomena we don't completely understand yet, but it... seems to make people... different. Of course, we all know the normal healthy male thinks only of sex occasionally and has no desire for sex with multiple partners. [the other men murmur in agreement]
Expert 5
Definitely true.
Chairman
Yes, we all know that, go on.
Expert 4
But in the sex addict, their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more. The mere sight of an attractive woman could... can make them think about sex with her.
Expert 6
[with fat cheeks] But what about love? How could tons of fame and money make you forget about love? [looks at the woman to his right]
Chairman
What could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction?
Expert 7
[black] It could be caused by something in the water supply. Uh, perhaps even by - global warming.
Expert 8
[Japanese ancestry] Or cooling.
Expert 9
Yes
Expert 7
If.so, then the disease could start to affect our children
Chairman
That does it! [pounds the table softly] I want health screening at all our nation's schools! We need to find out if any young people might be carrying this disease.
South Park Elementary, day, 4th Grade classroom. A researcher stands before the class with a clipboard
Expert 9
Good afternoon, students. We are going to be a doing a health screening today. It won't take long, it'll be relatively painless, but we need to see if any students are showing... symptoms. [to his left is a cart with two beakers, a tray, and a picture resting against the legs] I'n a moment, I'm going to show you a suggestive picture. [puts the tray on the middle shelf of the cart and picks up the picture] And then I'm going to ask you a question about that picture. Alright, ready? Here we go. [turns the picture around and a naked couple appears, caressing. The class gasps]
The class
Oh! Wow. Ohhh.
Kenny
[cheering] (Woo hoo!)
Kyle
Jesus, dude.
Butters
Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
Expert 9
Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided.
Butters
[pointing] I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
Expert 9
Okay, very good. [sets the picture down against the cart again] Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand?
Butters
[to Clyde] Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
Expert 9
Very good, turn your answers over please. [the students turn their sheets over]
Butters
Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
Expert 9
Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow? [most of the kids raise their hands] Very good, very good indeed. Now I'd like to see who answered "What handkerchief?" [Kenny is the first to raise his hand. Kyle is nervous and looks around, but then raises his left hand. Butters looks over at them and then raises his left hand] A-ha! You three boys, please come with me. [heads for the door as Kyle, Kenny, and Butters leave their seats]
Kyle
I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
Kenny
(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)
a small unused office at school. The researcher takes the boys into the office, has them sit at a table, and sits opposite them
Expert 9
I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction.
Kyle
What?!
Butters
Oh no!
Kenny
[annoyed] (Who fuckin' cares?)
Expert 9
We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid.
Kyle
Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?
Expert 9
Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students.
Butters
It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
Kyle
So what happens to us now?
Expert 9
[sighs and rises from his chair, walking off] A life of desperation and anguish, I'm afraid. Your addiction will start off slowly - magazines, Internet sites - but then, as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous. Most likely you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: autoerotic asphyxiation.
Kenny
(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)
Expert 9
I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome.
Kenny
(Really??)
Butters
Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
CDC Headquarters, day. The chairman and his board address the public
Chairman
Ladies and gentlemen, for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction. The results of our tests are troubling to say the least. Dr. Tonton?
Dr. Tonton
[expert 9, as it turns out. He heads to a chart] In fourth graders, five percent of male students were found to be sex addicts. By sixth grade the number goes up to thirty percent. At high schools, nearly ninety-one percent of male students answered, "What handkerchief?"
Chairman
We're facing a sex addiction epidemic in our country. Young people all over America are infected, and at extreme risk to themselves and to the people around them. [Kyle watches this on TV from his bed] They're leading lives of secret pain.
Reporter 1
And so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people?
Chairman
It appears so.
Reporter 1
The poor bastards!
Reporter 2
But what about us normal healthy adults? Are we at risk of exposure?
Chairman
We don't believe so. In adult males, for whatever reason, sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities. [Randy watches this on TV from bed. Sharon is beside him reading a book instead] However, we are still collecting data, and all-
Randy
Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
Chairman
-answers which we all desire. [next scene is the McCormick living room] Whatever is causing this outbreak, we guarantee we will find it! [Mrs. McCormick comes out with a pizza]
Mrs. McCormick
Kenny, it's time for dinner! [goes upstairs to Kenny's room and looks inside] Kenny? [turns around and gasps. Kenny had hanged himself from his closet door with a belt while dressed in a Batman suit and masturbating to a magazine. His left hand is tucked inside the tights, around the genitals] AAAA!
Kenny's funeral, day.
Priest
Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea.
Kyle
Oh God, it's true.
Priest
But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t-
Butters
There! It was like that! It looked just like that! [stands on his chair and points to a bush, then walks over to it] Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
Kyle
[reaching him] Butters! Butters, stop it!
Butters
[fights Kyle off] But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
Kyle
[pulls him away from the bush] Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
Butters
[fights Kyle off again] No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
Kyle
No! Butters, stop! [slaps him]
Butters
Haah! Leave me alone! [reaches for the bush again]
Kyle
Stop it! Stop! [pulls him back and flings him to the ground. They fight for a few seconds, then break down and cry out] Oh God! Oh God, help us!
EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11. Tiger is about to tee off.
Commentator
Tiger... lines up his drive. He'll be hoping for a birdie here. Concentration is key.
Elin
[runs into the scene from screen right with her own golf club] You motherfucker! I never should have married you! [starts hitting him with it]
Tiger
Aaagh! Goddamnit, stop it! [blocks her club with his, as in a sword fight, and now they trade blows]
Elin
How many women did you fuck-a?! How many?!
Stan
Aw dude, I clocked you!
Cartman
I told you this game was sweet, dude.
Stan
Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. [Elin gets a new club and her swings get faster]
Cartman
Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
Stan
Hit A and X together.
Announcer
Round 2. Fight!! [Tiger and Elin face off again and start swinging]
Cartman
Oh, you're going down, Elin!
Stan
I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
Announcer
Pre-nup power-up. [a pre-nuptial agreement appears onscreen and then flies off. Elin swings and Tiger a few more times and he's on the grass on his back]
Cartman
Oh no! [Elin continues beating up Tiger] Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?

All right, sex addicts. What other destructive behaviors that we engaged in that led to our ultimate downfall? [on the dry-erase board are three examples: "Sex Shop Visits, Sex With Hookers, Going To Strip Clubs"] Anyone have another example? Let's see, how about... David!
David Letterman
Haha, Oh, ahh, having sex with employees.
Therapist
[writing on the board] "Sex with employees." Definitely a danger there. What else? Uh, Mr. Clinton.
Bill Clinton
Putting cigars in girls' vaginas?
Therapist
Very good, Billy. [writing on the board] "cigars in vaginas." Not the best idea there.
Charlie Sheen
Watching Internet porn all day every day?
Therapist
Spot on, Charlie Sheen! Excessive [writing on the board] "Internet porn." Now, the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today. I want you all to welcome Kyle and Bummers. The men all turn to look at the boys, who are seated in the last row.
Kyle
Hello?
The men
Hey Kyle, hi Kyle.
Therapist
And would you care to share your stories with us, boys?
Kyle
Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
Bill Clinton
Does your mom have big tits?
Therapist
Billy!
Bill Clinton
[sheepishly] Sorry...
Butters
Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
Ben Roethlisberger
I heard that.
Butters
I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
Therapist
Mr. Duchovny, please stop jerking off!
David Duchovny
[stops] Aw, gee whiz!
CDC labs, day.
Expert 4
To better understand the sex addiction outbreak, we've been running tests on chimpanzees. [an enclosure full of chimps is shown] You can see that this entire community of specimens are getting along normally, some pairing off, others on their own, but now see this chimp here. [a chimp is shown sitting peacefully scratching himself here and there] An average adult normal male blending in seamlessly with the others. Now watch. We're going to give it a lot of money. [presses a button and speaks into a mic] Go ahead. [two researchers walk into the enclosure and dump lots of dollar bills on the peaceful chimp and walk out. The chimp looks at the money and starts getting excited. He stands up and grins widely, then walks around with dollars bills in his hands. He walks up to a chimp with a baby chimp in her hands and bangs her from behind. She lets the baby go. The male chimp moves on to the next female and bangs her face to face, then he moves to the third female and bangs her from behind. ]
Chairman
My God...
Expert 4
Yes... [the chimp goes on to bang two other females and an angry chimp is heard in the background. She comes out in curlers, robe, and slippers, and wields a rolling pin. She approaches the male chimp and beats him up with the rolling pin, then walks away as he writhes on the ground. The other chimps hoot and holler, and one of them throws feces at him] The subject is now isolated and shunned.
Chairman
Incredible. And, and what's it doing now?
Expert 4
Making a public apology on its talk show. [and so it is]
Karne Institute for Sexual Addiction, day.
Therapist
Alrighty. Now, we all know the destructive behaviors that got us into this predicament, don't we? What is the main thing we've all learned to avoid? [Tiger raises his hand] Yes, Tiger?
Tiger Woods
Avoid drugs? And alcohol?
The other men
Auugh!
Therapist
No, no, Tiger, you still aren't getting it. [Kyle has a memo pad and pen, Butters is trimming a small bonsai tree] In order to make sure we are no longer destroying our lives with any of these behaviors, we must avoid... anyone? Avoid getting... anyone?
Michael Douglas
Caught.
Therapist
Yes, Michael Douglas! Everyone!
The Men
Getting caught.
Therapist
Very good! You are all here in therapy [draws a big circle around the destructive behaviors and writes "CAUGHT" over them] because you got caught! So how do we avoid getting caught? Ben Rothlisberger?
Ben Rothlisberger
Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms?
David Letterman
When they uh ask you for money, pay them.
Therapist
Good, yes!
Kyle
Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. [Butters stops trimming the tree, the men all look at Kyle]
Bill Clinton
[breaks the silence] What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Kyle
Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. [the therapist turns around and walks away from the group, then places a call]
Therapist
Yeah, it's me. We've got a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl.
The White House, Oval Office, day. The chairman of the CDC and a researcher are talking to President Obama
Chairman
Mr. President, in every test the results were the same. The monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels. It appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop.
Obama
So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success.
Chairman
No good, Mr. President. Because we've learned that sex addicts will find ways to make money and become successful in order to feed their addiction.
Obama
You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women??
Chairman
Yes. That's why we decided to look at the cash itself for clues! We tried to find something in the hundred dollar bill that could explain why this is happening now. Then we looked at the backside, and found this. [points to the picture of Independence Hall on the back of the bill] Independence Hall.
Obama
The birthplace of our country.
Chairman
We believe something is happening in Independence Hall that gives money its power over men.
Obama
Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country.
Chairman
And you think that these aliens... could be back with a new virus? One originating from Independence Hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women?!
Obama
[seriously] It's the only explanation that makes any sense. [glances at Michelle, who doesn't react, then looks at the chairman again]
Tiger Woods' press conference. "I WAS UNFAITHFUL, HAD AFFAIRS, AND I CHEATED."
Tiger
I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise-
Elin
[off-stage] You motherfucker!
Tiger
Oh no!
Elin
I should have never married [jumps out from behind the curtain and whacks him with a golf club] youuu! [continues whacking him]
Tiger
Agh! Stop it!
Elin
A porn star?! You screwed a porn star?! [the camera pulls back to reveal the video game the boys were playing earlier]
Cartman
Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
Stan
Yeah, back in that water level. [looks over at the front door, then back at the game] Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
A military helicopter in the night sky. Kyle and Butters are with the other addicts
Kyle
Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
Therapist
[sighs heavily] We are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all!
Butters
Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
Therapist
Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense.
Kyle
...As soon as what's dead? [the men groan]
Therapist
The infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at Independence Hall!
Independence Hall, night. Police, SWAT, and firefighters swarm the grounds and police barricades are put up. The front doors blow off their hinges and the SWAT team moves in.
SWAT Officer 1
Entrance is clear, Mr. President. [Obama leads the chairman and other CDD officials into the front room of the building]
Chairman
Mr. President, you aren't safe here. Let us handle this.
SWAT Officer 2
Right side clear!
Expert 4
We must be careful. The alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility.
Obama
[softly] Which would mean that the alien is also a wizard.
Expert 10
Yes! It explains everything! A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species, causing all the men to become sex addicts.
Obama
Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.
SWAT Officer 2
[chuckles] Okay okay alright alright, hang, hang on guys. I mean, come on, this is getting a little ridiculous. Wizard aliens? We all know what's going on here, don't we? Whenever a story breaks about some rich famous guy going around and having sex with tons of girls, we all wanna act like we don't understand it, but we do. We're guys, you know? Our brains are wired to strive to be the alpha male and get all the women we can. [walks into an open area in the room] I mean, look where we are. Even, even Benjamin Franklin screwed everything that moved. Because he could. We don't have to condone what these rich, famous people do, but... we can at least admit that, given the same temptations and opportunities that somebody like Tiger Woods has, a lot of us guys might do somethin' similar. [Obama thinks this over...]
Obama
[speaks into a mic strapped to his wrist] We have a turd in the punch bowl.
Secret Service Agent
Turd in the punch bowl. [the other SWAT members close in on him]
SWAT Officer 2
Hey, what are you doin- No. No, come on. [and take him away] Where are you takin' me?
News 4 news break. A reporter and camera are outside Independence Hall
News 4 Reporter
Ten city blocks have been shut down because an alien is believed to have taken refuge here in Independence Hall. By all accounts, the alien is also a wizard, who could very easily be the cause of the outbreak of sex addiction in our country. [everyone in the Hall is moving around cautiously, with flashlights on.]
SWAT Officer 3
[voice only] Mr. President, here they are. [all flashlights point towards the source of the voice. The SWAT officers make way for the therapist, Kyle, and Butters]
Therapist
This is the boy I told you about. And his friend, Bummers.
Chairman
Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true?
Kyle
I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
Chairman
A-mazing. Then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him! He could draw the bastard out!
Obama
Quick, give that boy a gun! [a SWAT officer gives him a rifle]
Kyle
What?
SWAT Officer 3
You'd better take one too. [gives Butters a rifle]
Obama
Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs. [moves towards the stairs as well]
Kyle
What bastard?
Obama
[looks back at Kyle] The alien wizard hiding out here! Come on, we've got tuh- [a muffled voice is heard]
Chairman
[on the stairs] The hell was that?
SWAT Officer 4
I got a baaad feelin' about this. [behind Kyle and Butters, a door opens and the kidnapped SWAT officer stumbles out with his hands tied in front of him and holding a wand, wearing a huge green mascot head of an alien with ogre ears, a white beard, and a wizard's hat.]
Dr. Tonton
Oh my God there it is!
Chairman
It's the alien wizard! It's gonna get you boys! Shoot it! [a strobe light flickers on and off, blinding the bound SWAT officer, who stumbles around trying to free himself]
Obama
Shoot it boys!
Expert 6
You have to shoot it! [Kyle fires a shot]
Chairman
Shoot it again, it's still alive! [Butters fires a shot]
SWAT Officer 5
You gotta reload! [the boys reload slowly]
Expert 4
Keep firing, boys! Shoot it in the heart! [Kyle fires a shot]
Obama
Keep shooting it!
Expert 11
Shoot him in his blabber mouth! [Kyle fires again, then Butters fires a shot, and the SWAT officer falls to the floor dead. The strobe light keeps flashing just in case]
Chairman
My God, they've done it!
Outside Independence Hall. The sex addicts dance around and moan gleefully
Bill Clinton
Look! The sex addiction! It's leavin' my body!
David Letterman
I can feel it! I'm free!
Another addict
We are healed!
The White House, day. President Obama addresses the nation from the South Lawn. "Sexual Healing" plays in the background
Obama
We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell. [the crowd on the lawn jumps up and cheers]
Randy
[watching this on TV in the bedroom] Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? [Sharon isn't paying any attention, preferring to read a book]
News 4 Reporter
We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness?
Kyle
[unsure] I guess it... feels great. Thanks. [Butters looks pissed off]
Butters
Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again! [swats the reporter's hand away and walks towards the camera] I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
Tiger Woods' press conference. "I AM RETURNING TO GOLF IN 3 WEEKS."
Tiger
I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys. [she glances at him, he glances at her, she glances back at him] So I officially announce my return to golf.
EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11. Tiger tees off and the audience claps approvingly. The ball reaches 350 yards. Nothing more exciting happens
Cartman
What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
Stan
Yeah, where's all the fighting?
Cartman
Dude, screw this! [gets off the sofa and throws his controller to the floor, then walks away] Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
Stan
Yeah, golf is stupid again. [gets off the sofa and tosses his controller onto the sofa, then follows Cartman out]
End of Sexual Healing

The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs
South Park Elementary, day, Fourth Grade class. The bell rings and Mr. Garrison enters with a box of books.
Mr. Garrison
Okay kids, let's take our seats. [sets the box down on the desk] There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.
Cartman
[sarcastically, folds his arms together] Aww, books? God, I hate those!
Mr. Garrison
Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. [the book in question is J.D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye]
Cartman
Oh really? Sweet.
Mr. Garrison
It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqué parts... [begins handing out the books individually]
Stan
All right!
Mr. Garrison
...and strong vulgar language...
Kenny
(Awesome, dude!)
Mr. Garrison
...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
Cartman
Oho man, I can't wait!
Mr. Garrison
Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
Cartman
No on, come on, let's read it now!
Kyle
Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
Mr. Garrison
Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! [jabs his left index finger at the floor]
Cartman
Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
Mr. Garrison
You will read it at home, [jabs his left index finger at the floor again, then puts his palms on his hips] and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!
Class
Awww!
Kyle's house, that afternoon. Kyle is reading at his desk, Stan is on the floor next to Kyle's bed reading. Kyle is almost finished with the book while Stan is halfway through it.
Stan
Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
Kyle
No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
Stan
[turns the page] I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said "shit" and "fuck" a few times.
Kyle
I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. [the door opens and a pissed-off Cartman enters and closes the door]
Cartman
Motherfucker! [Kyle turns around to face him, Stan stands up and walks up to him] The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, "alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming," and then after like a hundred pages I was like "alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end," and then I got to the last page, and I was all "the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"
Kyle
[picks up his book] Why the hell was this book banned?!
Cartman
They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! [the door opens again and Kenny enters with his book]
Kenny
(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
Cartman
We know, we were just saying that.
Stan
Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
Butters' house, same time. He's reading the book at the kitchen table with an odd look in his eyes. He sets the book down
Butters
Kill John Lennon... [leaves his chair and walks across the kitchen] Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon... [reaches into a bottom drawer and pulls out a large steak knife] Kill John Lennon! [walks by his dad's study and stops to look in] Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
Stephen
John Lennon's dead, Butters.
Butters
[lowers the knife instantly] Aww. Dangit. [drops it and walks away]
Kyle
Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
Cartman
It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
Stan
Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. [Kyle breaks into a grin]
Cartman
Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
Kyle
Yeah, sweet.
Kenny
(Awesome.)
Kyle
[starts typing] The Tale of... [can't think of anything, so his smile disappears]
Cartman
The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
Kenny
(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)
Kyle
Oh that's, [giggles] yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
Cartman
It was a... a warm spring morning. [background music plays and a montage follows. Next is the school playground where, as other kids play, Stan and the other three sit on the steps of a side entrance and continue working on their book, with Cartman taking notes Next is Stan's room where Stan is typing the next part of the book. The boys are having fun with the writing. Next scene is in Cartman's room where Cartman is again writing the story down. Kyle has brought Ike over for company. Finally, a few days later, Sharon enters Stan's room to put away his clean clothes. She puts away some underwear, but notices something in the drawer. Under Stan's shirts is the manuscript to the story the boys have been working on. Sharon reaches for it.]
Stan's room, day. Sharon grabs the manuscript and begins reading it
Sharon
"The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs"? [goes to the first page] "It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his"... [reads silently] Ew. "He took a..." [stunned] What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! "He then grabbed his dog's" [stifles a gag but can't hold it in, and barfs] Ehohoh, oh my God! "Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered" [tries not to barf again, but can't hold it in] Nooo! Nooo! [reads some more, but then coughs, then barfs] Noho! Nooo! [Sharon then falls unconscious and rolls on her back]
The Marsh kitchen, downstairs. Sharon races down with the manuscript...
Sharon
Randy? [spots him working on a small wooden ship and runs in] Randy! Randy, you need to read this!
Randy
Read what?
Sharon
This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
Randy
So?
Sharon
Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!
Randy
Huh?
Sharon
I mean it's disgusting. [hands the manuscript over to him] It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!
Randy
"It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-" Ew, Sharon, gross!
Sharon
Nono, just keep reading.
Randy
"He took a- and then-" Oh, man. Oh, this- [turns to his left and barfs on the floor. Sharon turns away and shields herself]
Sharon
I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.
Randy
Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!
Sharon
Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
Randy
"Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-" What? "He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-" [barfs again. He spends a couple hours more reading, and finally reaches the last few pages. There's a pail in front of him now, but the vomit has gone all over the place. He has a small towel in his left hand covered in vomit. His voice is now soft and beat] "That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest." Oh... Oh, man.
Sharon
Well?
Randy
It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
Sharon
Right? It's not just me.
Randy
No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!
Sharon
What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
Randy
NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
Cartman's house, day, living room. Kenny, Cartman and Kyle are playing a video game
Cartman
Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
Stan
[runs into the living room in a panic] Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
Cartman
...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
Stan
Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
Kyle
Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
Cartman
And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
Stan
Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
Butters' house, day. He's in the living room watching TV. Cartman walks in with the other three boys
Cartman
Butters, what are you up to?
Butters
Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
Kim
Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!
Butters
Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
Stan
Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!
Butters
I am?
Cartman
Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
Butters
Oh no. Which book was that?
Cartman
Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
Butters
I don't even remember that. [gasps] But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
Kyle's house, day. The boys and their parents are in the living room
Sharon
Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Sheila
We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
Stan
Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. [Butters walks in hanging his head]
Cartman
That's right.
Randy
Butters? Is that true?
Butters
Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
Gerald
Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
Butters
Huh?
Kyle
What? [the other boys can't believe it]
Gerald
Yeah, it's really amazing.
Butters
[brightens up] Oh, thanks.
Sheila
We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.
Mr. Needlebaum
Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel.
Stan
Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!
Kyle
Yeah, we wrote that!
Randy
Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.
Kyle
No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
Butters
I wrote that. [the adults begin to murmur amongst themselves]
Stephen
Really amazing.
Stan
What? Hey! [Butters is pleased for once]
A news report
News Anchor
It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called "literary genius." The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this weekend, and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting.

News Anchor
The book is changing the literary world. And it is all thanks... to Leopold "Butters" Stotch. [a picture of Butters in a pensive pose pops up]
South Park Elementary, day. The students mill around. Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, and Mr. Adler supervise the hallway
Clyde
Hey, here he comes!
Mr. Adler
Amazing book, Butters. [Mr. Garrison comes out of his classroom]
Butters
Thank you! [clasps his hands together and congratulates himself as he walks down the hallway]
Mrs. Streibel
You've changed my life, young man.
Butters
That's nice. [waves to everyone and walks on, but runs into Stan and the boys, who are mad at him]
Cartman
Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
Butters
Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?
Kyle
Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
Butters
But, you told me I did!
Stan
Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! [two girls rush up to Butters' aid]
Red
Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist.
Lola
He's so brooding and full of angst.
Butters
Yeah, I'm broooding.
Cartman
Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
Rebecca
Oh God, you guys are pathetic!
Lola
Yeah, get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once. [the girls leave]
Stan
God-damnit!
Kyle
Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
Butters
No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
Cartman
That inconsiderate jerk!
The HBC logo pops up - a spoof of the NBC Peacock. What follows is an HBC News presentation
Announcer
Today on Today: We meet the author of the book that has swept the nation, and has now spawned TV's most popular game show, "How Long Can You Listen To Scrotie McBoogerballs On Audiobook" [the studio audience joins in] "And Not Vomit?" [a contestant is fitted with headphones and place in a soundproof booth. The front panel is a glass door so the audience can see the contestant's reaction without getting sprayed with vomit. It only takes two seconds of listening before the contestant vomits all over the door] The book is full of disgusting words and acts, including Sarah Jessica Parker, who is mentioned four hundred and sixty-five times. [a shot of Parker and her date at the Oscars] Matthew Broderick, are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book?
Broderick
Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me.
Announcer
Uh huh, and Matthew, how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you, and why is it wearing a dress? [cut to a shot of the Stotch family sitting in Butters' room]
Matt Lauer
Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents.
Stephen
Hello Matt
Linda
Hi everyone.
Matt Lauer
You must be pretty proud of your son.
Stephen
Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.
Meredith Vieira
And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct?
Stephen
Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.
Butters
I have to come right to my room after school.
Stephen
But we are very very proud nonetheless.
Al Roker
[chuckles] Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people?
Butters
Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
Matt Lauer
All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's [jumps off his stool and tries to vomit into a pail nearby, but misses. He vomits agin and this time gets it into the pail, burps, and coughs a few times, getting the last of the vomit into the pail, and finally spits. He gets back on the stool] Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested?
Butters
Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
Meredith Vieira
Is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings? [begins to vomit immediately]
Al Roker
Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading The Catcher in the Rye?
Butters
Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh. [gets into a trance] Kill Ronald Reagan. [hops off his bed and heads for the door] Kill Ronald Reagan.
Al Roker
Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters.
Butters
Oh really? [goes back to his bed] Oh yeah, gosh dangit.
Assembly Hall, day. Kenny, Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Sarah Jessica Parker are giving their speeches to the school board.
Stan
More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
Assemblyman 1
That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.
Cartman
There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
Assemblyman 2
You just fail to understand what the author meant.
Kyle
The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
Assemblyman 3
[chuckles] No, no no, that's such a simplistic view.
Stan
Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
Assemblywoman 1
Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?
Kyle
Yes!
Assemblywoman 1
But what would be the point?
Cartman
There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
Assemblywoman 2
No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
Yes they would!
Assemblywoman 2
It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class.
Stan
What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
Assemblyman 2
Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country.
Stan
What?
Assemblywoman 2
Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature!
Assemblyman 2
What book did you read?!
Stan
There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
Assemblyman 4
Ohohh yeah, then why did Sarah Jessica Parker's butt-cheese end up in Scrotie's milkshake? [an assemblyman nearby throws up]
Butters' house, day. A Channel 9 reporter stands across the street from it as a small crowd gathers around the front door and look up at Butters' window
Field Reporter
Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room. [The reporter and Butters are yelling at each other to be heard.]
Field Reporter
Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
Butters
Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
Field Reporter
Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?
Butters
Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
Stephen
Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!
Butters
Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. [walks out of view]
Outside Assembly Hall, the boys sit on the curb. Sarah Jessica Parker stands next to a tree with a bare branch on which a bird sits
Stan
I can't believe they won't ban our book!
Kyle
I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
Kenny
(It's fucking disgusting!)
Cartman
All right you guys, I know what we have to do. [stands up and walks onto the street] We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
Kyle
What?! [Stan's hands go from his chin to his knees]
Cartman
Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
Kyle
Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! [Sarah Jessica Parker hears her name and looks at the boys]
Cartman
Shhh. [addresses Ms. Parker] Be right with you. [hushed tones to the other boys] We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
Stan
Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. [he and Kyle walk away]
Cartman
Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
Kenny
[looks over at Ms. Parker, then at Cartman] (Okay.)
Cartman
[turns and walks over to Ms. Parker] Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. [Kenny follows.]
The Today Show, an HBC News production
Matt
Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed.
Meredith
Al, how is it out there?
Al
[giggles] I don't know if you could see this, guys, but uh, the line stretches all the way around the block. People waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel. [the camera pans across the line from front to back and back again. The people in line smile and wave at the camera] And they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in. Just a festive atmosphere here, Matt and Meredith.
Meredith
Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat.
Matt
That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman.
a shot of Morgan Freeman sitting in a study, a fireplace to his left, a library to his right, preparing to read from Butters' second book
Morgan Freeman
[reading slowly, with gravitas] The Poop That Took A Pee Chapter 1: Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, "I need to poop." "Okay," Rebecca replied, "I like poop." Douglas squatted down [turns the page] over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener. [turns the page] Chapter 2...
The woods, day. A sign by the side of a road indicates that moose hunting season is here and the woods are open. Cartman and Kenny are standing in the bush. Kenny makes a moose call with his hands and mouth. They wait for a response. Kenny makes the call again
Cartman
See any hunters yet?
Kenny
(Not yet) [Ms. Parker is in a nearby clearing with moose horns attached to her head]
Cartman
Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
Kyle
Guys, stop, stop! [Kyle and Stan walk into view towards Cartman and Kenny] We don't have to do this!
Kenny
(Huh?)
Kyle
Butters wrote a second book!
Cartman
So what?
Stan
So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
Kyle
We can get people to believe us now!
Cartman
Oh dude, sweet! [all four boys walk away, leaving Ms. Parker all alone at the mercy of any moose hunter that walks by her]
Cut to the in-studio reading of Butters' second novel
Morgan Freeman
"Why are we here?" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all.
Frontier Books, morning. The shoppers pick up where Morgan left off
Shopper 1
"The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs."
Shopper 2
"And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt."
Stan
[in store with the other boys] Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. [grins]
Cartman
People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
Shopper 3
Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think?
Marsha
So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book.
Shopper 4
I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots.
Cartman
What?!
Stan
You can't be serious! You people like this?!
Shopper 5
Some of the imagery is unbelievable
Kyle
A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
Shopper 6
Says you! You must be a pro-life nut, huh? [slides into taunting] Didn't like what the book had to say?
Marsha
What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!
Cartman
Oh come on!
Stan
God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
Shopper 7
"And the poop and the pee lived happily every after. The end." [closes the book...] Kill the phonies. Kill the phonies!
Keeping Up With The Kardashians is on the air
Kim
Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear.
The Kardashians
Yaaay!
Male Guest
Can I go with you girls? [the seventh shopper breaks into the set and guns everyone down]
News report about the massacre
News Anchor 2
Our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the Kardashians. The shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading The Poop That Took A Pee by Leopold "Butters" Stotch. It's all over. The Kardiashians.. [cries a bit and sheds a tear] wiped out. In the blink of an eye. All because one little PRICK... had to go and write a book.
Butters' room, day. Butters is at his desk with his face buried in his arms. The news report is airing on the TV in the background
News Anchor 2
Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK! [the anchorman falls silent and the door opens. Cartman and the other boys enter]
Cartman
Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
Butters
I know.
Stan
They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
Butters
[lifts his head up. He's been crying] You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
Kyle
Ah... Oh Butters, [steps forward] it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
Stan
Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
Butters
Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
Cartman
That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
Butters
What?
Cartman
[sighs heavily] You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
Butters
What?! Oh no!
Cartman
Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. [walks out of the room with the other boys]
Butters
Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. [leaves his desk and follows the other boys downstairs]
End of The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs

Medicinal Fried Chicken
A soccer field, day. The four boys are at soccer practice with other boys from around the neighborhood. They're exercising, touching their bellies, then their feet, then raising their hands in the air.
Group
Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.
Cartman
[after "27"] Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
Coach
You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.
Cartman
[faking] I know, it sucks. [the coach blows his whistle as the boys reach "40"]
Coach
Alright kids, practice is over for today.
Cartman
[grins and throws his sports bottle away] KFC!! [races for his ride]
Randy's car, after practice. Randy drives the boys across town
Cartman
Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
Kyle
Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
Cartman
Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you! [remembers where he is] Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
Randy pulls up to a KFC and parks the station wagon. Everyone gets out
Stan
Hey it looks different.
sure enough, the KFC logo and lettering are gone, but the building still has that KFC style of architecture. The windows advertise medicinal marijuana though. A customer comes out with a bag of weed.
Randy
[to the customer] Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?
Customer
[stops] Oh, it's not a KFC anymore. It's a medicinal marijuana dispensary. [walks away]
Stan
A what?
Cartman
Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
Kyle
So where's the KFC now?
Randy
Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. [leaves them and enters the store.]
Inside the medicinal marijuana dispensary. Randy walks toward the counter, looking around at the place
Clerk
Can I help you sir?
Randy
Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
Clerk
Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.
Randy
Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
Clerk
Sure. New state laws say it's okay.
Randy
[thinks about what this means] Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion [goes to another counter] and give me some of that purplish stuff too!
Clerk
Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
Randy
[his smile vanishes] My huh?
Clerk
Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.
Randy
Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! [races out the door]
outside the shop. Randy runs past the boys
Stan
What'd they say?
Randy
[speaking quickly] KFC's gone, been replaced.
Cartman
They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
Randy
Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. [runs to the car, opens the driver-side door, and quickly gets in]
Stan
The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.
Randy
I gotta get to the doctor! [pulls out of his parking slot and drives away in a hurry, leaving the boys by themselves]
Kyle
...so no KFC?
Cartman
This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
A doctor's office. Randy is on the bed there and the doctor walks to him with some test results
Dr. Doctor
Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal.
Randy
All right!
Dr. Doctor
Yep, you check out fine.
Randy
That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
Dr. Doctor
For what?
Randy
Medicinal marijuana. [the doctor frowns] There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.
Dr. Doctor
Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.
Randy
But you said I'm totally healthy!
Dr. Doctor
Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!
Randy
...Well that sucks! [gets off the bed and puts his clothes back on.] Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
Dr. Doctor
Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
Randy
Yeah, but what's the quickest way?
Dr. Doctor
The what?
Randy
Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
On Highway 291, night. Liane and Eric are driving northwest into the San Isabel National Forest west of Pueblo. Cartman is showing his frustration by punching the car door
Cartman
Mom, drive faster!
Liane
The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.
Cartman
Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
Liane
Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?
Cartman
WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
Liane
Alright honey, let's take it easy.
Cartman
Fuck you!
Frisco, day. Liane and Eric arrive at the KFC in Frisco, which is being closed up. "CLOSED INDEFINITELY" says the banner over the Colonel's face as workers take down the K and the C
Cartman
No! No, what's going on?! [quickly gets out of the car and shoves a worker aside] Move aside! [stops at the front door and looks up again]
Worker 1
It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there.
Cartman
No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
Worker 1
Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas.
Cartman
You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
Worker 2
No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.
Cartman
Nooooooooo-! [his head explodes]
The Marsh house, day. Randy is on a chaise lounge in his backyard trying to give himself cancer with three possible carcinogens - cigarettes, an X-ray machine and reflective panels, and three cell phones strapped to his forehead. He's smoking.
Stan
[opens the sliding door and looks out] Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
Randy
Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. [Stan walks away and closes the sliding door]
A methadone clinic, day. Cartman walks in and approaches the counter
Clerk 2
Can I help you?
Cartman
[looking fatigued and feeling quite itchy] I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. [sniffs heavily]
Clerk 2
Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-
Cartman
[hops onto a little stool in front of the counter] Really?
Clerk 2
-your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours. [hands him an application]
Cartman
Whoa, what uh, are you serious? [fills out the application as she gets a treatment out of a cabinet. He turns around...] Oh my God, that's KFC gravy! [quite giddy] You have KFC! Yes! [she opens the gravy and pours some into a small cup, then slides the cup to him. He's disappointed] This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
Clerk 2
This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.
Cartman
Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
Clerk 2
[takes the cup back] If you don't want it, that's fine-
Cartman
[grabs it from her hand] NO! [swallows it as fast as he can] Oh God, oh God it's so good.
The Marsh house, kitchen, day. Randy opens a box of instant chicken nuggets and pours the nuggets onto a plate.
Randy
[reading from the book "Cancer Today"] "Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers." Alright. [takes the plate and puts the nuggets into the microwave oven, sets the time to four minutes, then starts the oven] "Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..." [he loses hope] "slow-growing and can take years to develop." Dammit. [turns the page] "Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive." Oh this is good. "There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation" Hmmm. [closes the book and looks at the microwave and at his balls a few times. Some time later, Stan goes to the kitchen, opens the door, and grabs a sports energy drink, closes the door and walks away. He walks by Randy, who's got the microwave door open and his balls inside the oven.] Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer? [Stan just looks at him and continues on his way.] Stan?
The Marsh house, dawn. A rooster crows. Randy is still asleep in his bed, but something is beginning to bother him. He turns from his side to his back and then looks at his feet. What he sees amazes him. He pulls down the covers and sees that his balls have grown to the size of large pumpkins
Randy
Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!
Sharon
Wha... WAAAAA! [she almost lost her mind there]
Dr. Doctor's office, day. Randy is now in a hospital bed and Sharon sits next to it.
Dr. Doctor
Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer.
Randy
SCORE! [Sharon is not happy]
Dr. Doctor
Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-
Randy
Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
Dr. Doctor
Your prescription for what?
South Park, day. Randy is carting his massive balls around in a wheelbarrow, singing happily
Randy
Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
The medicinal marijuana dispensary, day. Randy enters with his wheelbarrow
Randy
One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
At a lamp post in downtown. Officer Barbrady has stopped a speeding motorist and looks over at Randy, who's smoking some weed in plain view.
Randy
Uh that is nice! That is nice!
Jimbo
[walks by, sees him, and runs over] Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!
Randy
I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
Jimbo
No, I mean, your actual balls!
Randy
Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! [laughs]
Elsewhere in South Park. Cartman walks down the street sighing heavily
Tough Boy 1
Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC.
Cartman
Yeah. Who isn't?
Tough Boy 1
Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house.
Cartman
Billy Miller? Seriously??
Billy Miller's house, basement. The boy follows Cartman down the stai
Billy
Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?
Cartman
Tommy said you have some KFC.
Billy
Suuure. [snaps his fingers and waves someone forward] Jessie. [a girl brings a tray with food over to Cartman]
Cartman
Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce! [eats them as fast as he can] Oh God yes! [finishes it off] Where did you get that?!
Billy
I have my sources. That'll be $85.
Cartman
85 bucks?? I don't have that! [three boys behind him get serious and approach him. One of them has a bat]
Billy
Hold on, hold on. [the boys stop] You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.
Cartman
How much KFC are we talking?
Billy
Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
Cartman
Holy fuck, dude.
Billy
I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?
Cartman
Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
Billy
Excellent.
Medicinal marijuana dispensary, day. Randy exits the dispensary with his balls in the wheelbarrow
Randy
[smokes, coughs a little] Alright, see you tomorrow! [turns left and has difficulty maneuvering his massive balls. He walks down the sidewalk happily and checks his watch] Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes! [starts moving faster, but the wheelbarrow soon falls apart and he's left sitting on his balls.] Huh-oh Jesus! [looks around, unsure of what to do] Ugh, ohh. [tries to get his feet on the ground, but can't] Uhh, hey, can somebody..? [puffs on the joint, then pulls at his scrotum] ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home. [gets off his balls and starts pulling them down the street. He sits on them again and bounces on them] Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. [bounces down the sidewalk]
South Park, day. People stop and stare as Randy bounces down the street on his balls. He's laughing all the while.
Elsewhere in South Park, Cartman walks into an alley and looks around. Further in the alley he runs across a man
Cartman
Are you Teabag?
Teabag
Maybe I am. Who's askin'?
Cartman
Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
Teabag
Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money? [Cartman hands him a wad of bills] Alright, we're in biz. [turns right and grabs a couple of bags of KFC food, then hands them to Cartman, who looks inside each bag] It's all there, man.
Cartman
Extra crispy? [opens a small bowl of gravy and samples it carefully]
Teabag
'Course, man, I ain't no fool.
Cartman
You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
Teabag
Awww, it's all the same shit, man.
Cartman
IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! [reaches behind his back for a pistol and aims it at Teabag]
Teabag
Okay okay I'm sorry, oh... [gets on his knees and shields his face]
Cartman
You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
Teabag
I'll take back the gravy.
Cartman
[lunges at him with the pistol, making him get on all fours] Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
Teabag
AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too! [Barbrady walks by and stops to look]
Barbrady
What's going on back there?
Cartman
Nothin', it's cool.
A table, evening. Jimbo and Ned are shown playing poker
Jimbo
Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned.
Randy
[puffs on a joint and coughs] Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
Nelson
Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.
Randy
No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
Player 1
Aw some on, just give us a little bit.
Player 2
Yeah.
Randy
Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else. [a player listens a little more closely] Chicks... love 'em.
Nelson
Women love huge balls?
Randy
Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going "whaaa?" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. [pats his balls]
Woman 1
Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa? [backs up at the sight of Randy's balls, then runs off]
Randy
See?
Billy Miller's house, later. Cartman walks down the stairs with the bags of KFC he got from Teabag.
Billy
Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?
Cartman
Yeah I got the stuff. [the other boys carry the bags away] And I got the money. [tosses the wad of bills back at Billy]
Billy
Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!
Cartman
Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. [burps]
Billy
That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little "arrangement" with the Colonel himself.
Cartman
Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
Billy
That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?
Cartman
Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
Billy
Excellent.
Dr. Doctor's office, day. A nurse walks in with an envelope
Nurse
Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in. [hands the envelope to the doctor, who opens it and pulls the results out]
Dr. Doctor
What the hell is going on?
Nurse
Doctor?
Dr. Doctor
This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.
South Park, day. Silly music plays as a line of men bounce down the sidewalk on their swollen balls, smoking pot all the while. The line of men consists of the poker players from Travis' place.
Jimbo
Heh! Man, I am stoned off my ass!
Player 3
I'm stoned off my balls! [another man laughs]
Café Monet, day. The line of men hops past
Randy
Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
Woman 2
Wow. Those guys have nice balls.
Woman 3
Wish my man had balls like those.
Woman 2
Mmm.
Corbin, Kentucky, the Colonel's home, day. The Colonel is giving a tour of the place to Tommy and Cartman
The Colonel
Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit.
Tommy
We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?
Cartman
I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
The Colonel
I like you, Eric. There's no lying in you. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about your friend. Cartman: Who? You mean Tommy? [looks over at Tommy, then stops walking. The Colonel stops as well - Tommy is missing.] Wait, where's he go?
The Colonel
Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver. [hands him some binoculars and shows him where Tommy is. Through the binoculars, Cartman sees Tommy being roughed up by two men inside a helicopter. One of the men shows Tommy where Cartman is. There's a noose around Tommy's neck. The guy who shows him where Cartman is throws him out of the helicopter and hangs him. Cartman is stunned, but quickly gets over it and laughs]
Cartman
Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
The Colonel
And how do I know you're not a liar too?
Cartman
Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
The Colonel
I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time.
Cartman
Good.
The Colonel
Just remember, I only tell you one time. Don't fuck me, Eric. Don't you ever try to fuck me. [Cartman keeps his mouth shut]
The Marsh house, day. Randy is by the sliding doors in back of the house, as his balls are too big for the front door now.
Sharon
[walks up] Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.
Randy
I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
Sharon
Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? [looks down at his balls]
Randy
Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?
Sharon
Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-
Randy
Hey. My eyes are up here.
Sharon
I'm sorry, I just...
Randy
It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. [sends her an air kiss and hops out]
Medicinal marijuana dispensary, day. Randy hops up to the front door and opens it. He tries to hop in, but the balls are way too big. He gets off his balls and tries to shove them in
Randy
Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
Clerk
I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.
Randy
Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?
Clerk
Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
Randy tries to fit his balls through the door, grunting and murmuring from time to time, but they're just too damn big. He props them up so that he can shove them in with his ass, but they still won't go through
Randy
Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
Billy Miller's cellar, day. As Billy's boys move the KFC around this basement warehouse, Billy is talking to Cartman
Billy
What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!
Cartman
[munching on a breast from a bucket] Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
Billy
...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!
Cartman
[munching on a drumstick, his back to Billy] Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
Billy
How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!
Cartman
...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
Billy
What is that supposed to mean?
Cartman
I... [turns around to face Billy] told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
Billy
[suddenly vulnerable] You wouldn't do that.
Cartman
Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
Billy's Mom
Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!
Cartman
Bye bye Billy. [Billy leaves] Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
Medicinal marijuana dispensary, day. The poker players are bouncing around the dispensary's parking lot in protest. The clerk, the mayor and her aides, and a small crowd are watching these men
Randy
What do we want?
Men
Bigger doors!
Randy
Where do we want them?
Men
Weed stores!
Randy
What do we want?
Men
Bigger doors!
Randy
Where do we want them?
Men
Weed stores!
Clerk
Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.
Man 1
Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.
Man 2
Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others.
Clerk
Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.
Man 3
What's ridiculous about it?
Dr. Doctor
[runs through the crowd] Hold on, hold people people, please! [stops] We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!
Billy's basement, day. Cartman has squandered everything Billy has worked for by eating all the chicken.
Tough Boy 2
Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff.
Cartman
Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
Tough Boy 3
Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed.
Cartman
What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay. [leaves the throne] Put him on speaker.
The Colonel
Hello. Hello??
Cartman
Colonel, how are you doing?
The Colonel
What happened?
Cartman
[rips the skin off a breast and lays it on the table] Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? [takes out a credit card and starts mincing the skin as if it were crack cocaine, into lines of finely ground skin]
The Colonel
Eric, what happened??
Cartman
We had a little problem.
The Colonel
I heard.
Cartman
[snorts a line into his nose] Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
The Colonel
Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!
Cartman
Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
The Colonel
There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!
Cartman
Hey, take it easy Colonel.
The Colonel
I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!
Cartman
[grabs the phone] Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?! [hears someone breaking in and looks over his shoulder] Oh crap! [five men pour into the basement and start firing their machine guns at the boys, who scatter and try to escape. Two more men jump into the basement. More men outside the house begin firing their weapons. The police arrive and begin firing at the attackers]
Barbrady
Freeze!
Henchman
It's the cops! [Barbrady kills him. Another attacker is killed nearby. Cartman looks outside from the basement and begins his escape. Billy and his mom begin their escape as well, but through the front door]
Billy's Mom
Run Billy, run! [a bullet kills her. Cartman leaves the basement and escapes]
Billy
Mommy, no!
South Park City Hall, day. The top city officials are there, including the Mayor and her aides, Sgt. Yates and Murphy, and Dr. Doctor. Officer Barbrady addresses the crowd
Barbrady
Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. [the crowd cheers, and Dr. Doctor takes the mic]
Dr. Doctor
And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us. [the store has been renamed MFC - Medicinal Fried Chicken]
Randy
Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. [Sharon folds her arms and looks up and away angrily]
Sharon
Yeah. Great.
Randy
Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. [reaches into a bag and pulls out a flesh-colored winter coat. Sharon looks at it and grins instantly]
Sharon
Randy, I love it! [puts it on and strikes a few poses]
Randy
And when it gets cold it shrinks. [two women approach them]
Nelly's Mom
Sharon, you got a scrotum coat?
Sharon
Yyyup!
Woman 5
Luckyyyyy!
End of Medicinal Fried Chicken

You Have 0 Friends
Kyle's room, day. Kyle is at his computer. Kenny's on his laptop on Kyle's bed while Cartman is on the Internet on his phone.
Cartman
I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
Kyle
How the hell do you have more friends than me?
Cartman
'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
Kyle
How many friends do you have, Kenny?
Kenny
(Sixty two.)
Kyle
What? How the hell do I only have thirty seven friends?
Stan
[walks in] Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
Cartman
[retorts] Stupid Facebok stuff.
Stan
Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be out playing video games.
Kyle
Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
Stan
Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
Cartman
Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
Kyle
Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. [smiles]
Cartman
Surprise! [smiles]
Stan
Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
Kyle
Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Stan
I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
Cartman
Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy.
Stan
Who?
Cartman
Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends. [begins to gloat] And he's had a profile for more than six months.
Kyle
Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
Stan
You guys are retarded, I'm playing Xbox. [turns around and walks out.]
Kyle
There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
Kip Drordy's room, day. Kip sits there on his stool, a lonely figure with a misshapen head, looking at his monitor, hoping for a friend to finally appear on his Facebook page. "You have 0 friends." He looks away from the monitor and sighs, wiping a tear from his nose. A small pop-up window appears. Kip looks at it, then startles himself. He gets to his keyboard and reads the window: "Kyle Broflovski has added you as a friend." He rubs his eyes in disbelief and looks again. "Confirm Kyle as your friend?" He moves the cursor down to the "Confirm" button and clicks on it. Now his page reads "You have 1 friends."
Kip
[getting excited] Ahhhhh. [gets off his stool and runs around the room] Haaa! Haaaaaaaaaa! Yeah! [opens the door, runs out of his room and down the stairs and into the kitchen]
Kitchen, day.
Kip
Mom, Dad! I made a friend today!
Kip's Mom:
Kip, really?
Kip's Dad:
You did?
Kip
Yeah!! [jumps for joy]
Kip's Dad:
Huh son, that's wonderful.
Kip's Mom:
What's his name?
Kip
Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading.
Kip's Mom:
Oh, is he a nice boy?
Kip
Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?! [runs back to his room]
The Marsh dining room, evening. Stan is at the table doing homework. Randy pops in from the kitchen.
Randy
Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
Stan
Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.
Randy
Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
Stan
[looks over his shoulder] No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
Randy
...Oh okay. [walks away, but returns a few seconds later] So I'm, I'm not your friend then?
Stan
...Dad, you are my friend.
Randy
...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
Stan
Dad, it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
Randy
Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
Stan
I just wanna do my homework!
Randy
Alright, fine. [walks away again. Stan puts his face in his left palm, then gets back to homework. Randy returns...] Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?
Stan
Alright, Dad, I'll add you!
Randy
Oh cool! Okay. [walks away]
The Drordy house, night. The parents are watching TV from their sofa. Kip runs in.
Kip
Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar!
Kip's Mom:
That's great, Kip!
Kip
Yeah! [runs off]
Kip's Dad:
They sure are getting to know each other.
Kip's Mom:
It's amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?
Kip's Dad:
His friend lives on a farm?
Kyle's room, night. He's at his computer working on his farm - in Farmville.
Kyle
I think I'll add some more... pigs. [done] Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there. [moves his avatar to his corn fields and adds one] There we go. Nice. [a click and a small whoosh are heard, and Kyle looks at his screen. "You have 29 friends"] Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends. [a click and a small whoosh are heard. "You have 28 friends." More of these sounds are heard as Kyle's friend count drops] Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! [Kyle does what he can, but keeps losing friends]
South Park Elementary, day. Stan is at his locker switching books. Wendy walks up behind him.
Wendy
Am I a joke to you?
Stan
[stops moving, then turns around] What?
Wendy
I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?
Stan
...Um, no?
Wendy
You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!
Stan
Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
Wendy
Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?
Stan
Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
Wendy
You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page, [crosses her arms] we aren't friends!
Stan
Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
Wendy
And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to "In a relationship"!
Stan
How?
Wendy
By editing your profile under "basic information"!
Stan
Okay, I'm sorry!
Stan's room, night. He's at his computer editing his profile.
Stan
"Edit profile. Basic... settings" Jesus Christ!
Randy
Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
Stan
...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
Randy
Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
Stan
Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
Randy
That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. [walks away]
Stan
Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously! [an update pops up] What the hell is this?! Podcast?
Cartman
[in a video podcast] Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast! [Mad Friends podcast. Cartman sits behind a Mad Friends desk. At the bottom of the screen are two tickers. The upper one shows changes in friend stocks, the lower one shows Facebook updates] Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends! [rings a bell and leaves his chair] Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon. [presses a big red button, which produces a shotgun blast] You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why? [shows a birthday cake] Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita. [presses a button that produces the sound of a whistle] If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street. [cranks up a player that repeats "Word On The Street"] The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger [presses a robot that says "MERGER"] So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle!
The Marsh living room, nighttime. A knock is heard at the front door and Stan walks to the door and opens it. It's raining outside and Kyle is on the steps. He sniffles.
Kyle
Can I come in?
Stan
Sure dude. [Kyle enters, still sniffling] Dude, what's the matter?
Kyle turns to face his friend, tears in his eyes.
Kyle
I... don't... have... any... friends...
Stan
What?
Kyle
I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
Stan
Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.
Kyle
'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
Stan
NO.
Kyle
Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
Stan
Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
Kyle
[rushes up to Stan, falls on his knees, and grabs the lower part of his friend's jacket] YOU DON'T GET SUCKED INTO IT! YOU DON'T GET SUCKED IN AT ALL! PLEHEHEHEHEHEASE!
Stan
[frustrated] Ah, FUCK.
Stan's room, moments later. Stan is at his computer while Kyle watches on his phone.
Stan
Okay it says I'm at your farm.
Kyle
'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button... [Stan does so] and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm... [Stan does so] Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
Stan
'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
Kyle
Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
The Drordy house, day. The family is in the kitchen. Kip and his father are at the table eating while his mom is in the kitchen proper serving herself.
Kip's Dad:
So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today?
Kip
Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year.
Kip's Mom:
[joins the boys at the table] Oh, what'd he say about those?
Kip
He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'!
Kip's Dad:
Sounds like you boys had a ball!
Kip
Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?
Kip's Dad:
Well it's a little late, but it is Friday.
Kip's Mom:
I think the more time you spend with your little friend, the better.
Kip
Wow, thanks! [runs out of the kitchen]
Kip's Mom:
Have fun and be safe! [Kip runs through the living room and upstairs, then enters his own room]
Kip's room, night. Kip runs to his computer and gets onto Facebook. He begins to type.
Kip
Ate a pork chop for dinner. Had nice apple sauce too. [clicks on Share, and there's his status. He waits for a reply, from 7:20 to... 8:30. He gets a reply: Kyle likes the post] Hahaa haha! Yeah! [gets off his chair and dances around] Yeah, yeah, yeah!
South Park, day. Stan exits a Comic store with some comic books and turns right, only to stop when he sees Wendy.
Wendy
"I think you look cute in your bunny costume."
Stan
What?
Wendy
"I think you look cute in your bunny costume." What is that supposed to mean?!
Stan
...I have no idea.
Wendy
That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! [walks off in anger.]
Stan
[turns to see her walk off] Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! [turns around and continues on his way. He walks by an electronics store]
Man 1:
[standing in the doorway with a cigarette in his left hand] Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?
Stan
Fine! [continues walking, but a car pulls up next to him.]
Man 2:
Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?
Stan
[looks at him like he's crazy] I don't know you!
Man 2:
Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! [spits on Stan and drives off, Stan begins to shake in anger]
Stan's computer, later. He's looking at his Facebook page, still steaming from his encounters outside Comic Factory. "You have 845,000 friends".
Randy
Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
Stan
...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-
Randy
Stan, poke your grandma!
Stan
[squeezes his eyes shut and stays still for a moment] No. NO! Screw this! You know what? "Edit Profile > Update Profile." There! "Delete Profile"! [reads the popup] "You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel" Proceed! [presses "Proceed," then reads the next popup.] "Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No." Yes! "Are you totally sure?" Yes! [clicks on it and his screen goes black. A blinking amber cursor appears]
Computer Voice
[the following words appear onscreen] I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Stan Marsh.
Stan
You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? [his monitor has a built-in Webcam]
Computer Voice
I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid.
Stan
Delete Profile! "Are you totally sure? Yes or-" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete! [the webcam lights up and shoots a laser at Stan's forehead, knocking him back on his chair. It then sets up boxes of energy around his body] Hey Dad? [the camera begins scanning him in bit by bit, pixel by pixel] Dad? [He disappeared from his chair and he transported through the webcam. He soon appears on a virtual floor after traveling down some tunnels] Oh dude, what the fuck? [Neon lights appear all over]
Inside the game grid. Three guards approach him.
Guard 1:
Alright get moving, Profile.
Stan
Profile? I'm not a profile.
Guard 1:
Ignore. [shocks him with an electric prod.]
Stan
AAH. [The guards escort Stan away]
Profile 1:
Tom Davis says hello to Linda Green's profile.
Profile 2:
Linda Davis likes how Tom Davis has changed his status.
Stan
Excuse me, my name is-
Profile 3:
Ignore.
Stan
Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
Profile 4:
Ignore.
Stan
[realizes where he is] Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!
Mad Friends, which is being broadcast from Cartman's basement. Kyle has made it onto Cartman's podcast.
Kyle
I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
Cartman
You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
Kyle
I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
Cartman
Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
Kyle
I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
Cartman
It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
Kyle
No. What's chatroulette?
Cartman's room, later. Cartman is at his computer while Kyle sits on a chair looking on.
Cartman
Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
Kyle
Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.
Cartman
Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
Kyle
[a look of disgust comes over him] Aww, that's some dude jacking off! [turns away quickly]
Cartman
Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
Kyle
That's just a guy's penis too!
Cartman
Okay let's, let's try this one.
Kyle
[turns away quickly] Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
Cartman
Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas. [goes onto the next person] Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
Dude
[waves] Hey.
Cartman
This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
Dude
Oh yeah? [leaves his chair and goes to the other end of his room, turns around, unzips his pants]
Cartman
Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
Kyle
Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
Cartman
Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
The game grid. Stan walks around.
Stan
Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
Tom Davis
No, you aren't my friend. Would you like to be my friend?
Stan
No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
Tom Davis
Ignore. [turns to talk to another profile] So anyway, I really like taking long walks in the summer, you know, because there's like
Stan
Okay I'll be your friend.
Tom Davis
[turns back to Stan] Confirm. [both of them feel a surge of energy in their game suits, shown by the suits lighting up, then it disappears] Oooo, Tom Davis is thrilled to have become powerful by adding a new friend. Here are some pictures of my dog. And here he is in some silly outfits. Can you comment on these?
Stan
Awww!
Guard
[comes up behind Stan] Move it, profile!
Tom Davis
Oh oh.
Stan
Why oh oh?
Profile 5:
They're taking him to the gaming arena.
Tom Davis
Looks like I'm gonna be down a friend. [the guards escort Stan to the arena, shocking him once in a while. Another profile appears next to him]
Referee
You are about to face each other in combat! You will play the game for the amusement of the users! [the arena is activated and Stan and the other profile are sent in] Let the game commence! [they face each other and virtual bikes pop up under them, lifting them off the floor. The bikes are replaced with a table and two stools and a guard brings a game of Yahtzee to the table.]
Stan
Yahtzee?
Referee
One round only! Begin! [the opposing profile rolls first, leaves a pair of 3s and scoops up three dice, rolls again]
Profile 6:
Uhhh, I'm gonna count five in my five box.
Stan
Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
Guard
[shocks him] Play, profile!
Stan
[rolls and gets five 4s] Yahtzee. [the other profile gasps and vanishes in a fair bit of pain]
Cartman's room, later. Cartman is still clicking through chatroulette chatters.
Cartman
Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off... [coughs to clear his throat] That's a dude jacking off...
Kyle
That's it Cartman, I'm outta here! [walks to the bedroom door] Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! [about to open the door]
Cartman
Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle! [Kyle turns and goes back to Cartman's desk.] Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
Boy
Hello.
Cartman
Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
Boy
Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off.
Kyle
Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
Boy
Uhh, sure. If you'll come and visit my farm.
Kyle
Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
The Drordy house, day, kitchen. Mr. Drordy reads The World News, Mrs. Drordy is drying dishes.
Kip's Dad:
Honey, where's Kip? I haven't seen him all day.
Kip's Mom:
No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now.
The Bijou. Kip is in the audience enjoying the hell out of himself. He's watching a 3D movie with everyone else, as they're all wearing 3D glasses. He spills some popcorn onto an open laptop he brought with him. Kyle's Facebook page appears on the laptop screen. Kip takes out a camera and snaps a shot of himself and his laptop
[The gaming arena. The referee is angry...]
Referee
Troublemaker! You were not supposed to survive the game of Yahtzee! You have made things complicated!
Stan
I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
Referee
That's not what your profile said.
Stan
My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
Referee
Your profile is one of the most powerful in all of Facebook. You cannot stop it now.
Stan
Oh yeah? I can try! [turns around and walks through a wall]
Referee
After him!
Kyle's Facebook page. Kyle is working on his farm again.
Kyle
Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. "Hey Kyle, really like your farm." Oh awesome! [a new sound is heard] What the hell is that? Stan? [Stan appears on Kyle's farm and walks to the middle of the screen]
Stan
You're an asshole, Kyle!
Kyle
[perplexed] ...What?
Stan
What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
Kyle
[looks around making sure the coast is clear] Dude, w-what are you doing?
Stan
What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
Kyle
Profile status?
Stan
Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
Kyle
Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
Stan
Dude! Fuck your crops! [walks up to Kyle's corn and starts ripping the stalks up]
Kyle
Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry! [pulls up Stan's status] Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
Stan
Where?
Kyle
Café World.
Stan
Son of a bitch! [runs back to the barn he came out of]
Kyle
An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
Café World. Stan approaches the entrance, which has a sign next to it: "Friends of Stan Marsh Online Chat Party". He enters and is overwhelmed by the number of people in the café.
Stan
Jesus Christ.
Randy's profile:
Randy Marsh is at work right now. Work is boring.
Butters' profile:
Butters Stotch is enjoying Stan's chat party.
Garrison's profile:
Herbert Garrison likes Butters' comment.
Grandma Marsh's profile:
Grandma Marsh would like to be friends with Kevin Donahue.
Kevin Donahue's profile:
Kevin Donahue accept's Grandma Marsh's friendship.
Stan
Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!
Susan92's profile:
Susan92 has pictures of Stan in a bunny costume.
Gary Johnson's profile:
Gary Johnson thinks the pictures are fantastic!
Kyle
Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
Isiah
Isiah's order is on leaving Kyle Broflovski as a friend.
Kyle
What? Why?
Isiah
User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock.
Kyle
Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
Isiah
Ignore.
Kyle
Unh, that does it!
Stan
Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up! [everyone shuts up and looks at him] Where is profile Stan Marsh! [the room begins to rumble]
Profile Stan Marsh
[rising from the ground] Right here.
Stan
Oh...
Kyle's room, night. Kyle is at his desk thinking about how to break the news to Kip.
Kyle
I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. [moves the cursor to the Send button and clicks it. With the message sent, Kyle moves the cursor to the left side of the screen and selects "Remove from Friends," and clicks that. A popup window shows up: "Kip Drordy - Remove from Friends?" He clicks on "Remove from Friends" and Facebook tells him his friend is removed.]
Kip's room, night. He's at his computer typing along happily when he sees Kyle's message. He's disheartened. Kyle disappears from his friend list and he's back down to 0 friends. Kip leaves his stool and walks over to a wall on which he has a large picture of Kyle. He takes the picture down and returns to his stool, and sighs.
The gaming arena. Stan and his profile face off.
Stan
What do you want from me, dude?!
Profile Stan Marsh
I'm your profile, and as you can see, I am much more powerful than you.
Stan
Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
Profile Stan Marsh
Why do you think I brought you in here? The fact of the matter is I'm up and running now with almost a million friends. I don't need you anymore. I have more friends than you'll ever have in the real world.
Stan
Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
Profile Stan Marsh
Who is more powerful? The user or the profile? Let's end this once and for all. [the Yahtzee platform appears under them]
Referee
Let the final battle begin! [the crowd drops down, or the platform rises. Hard to tell. The table and two stools appear and a guard brings the Yahtzee board game over]
Stan
Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? [his giant profile takes a seat and rolls the dice]
Profile Stan Marsh
What did I tell you?! That's a large flush already! You don't have a chance in here, user! You pathetic little-
Stan
Yahtzee.
Profile Stan Marsh
What?!
Stan
Yahtzee. Sixes.
Profile Stan Marsh
No. Can't be.
Randy
Yahtzee!
Profile Stan Marsh
No! Ahhhhh! [vanishes in a fair bit of pain. After some silence, Stan disappears from the arena and is reassembled back on his chair at home]
Stan's room, moments later.
Stan
Awgh! [catches his breath. With his profile destroyed, Stan sees that he has 0 friends.] Oh thank God.
Randy
Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
Stan
My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
Randy
Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
Stan
Fuck off, Dad. [turns off the monitor and leaves his desk.]
Kip's room, night. Kip is waiting by his computer for a friend, any friend, to appear and become his friend. A sound is heard and all of a sudden Kip has a lot of friends - 845,323 of them - and he's shocked. Then he gets excited all over again. He dances and jumps on his stool.
End of You Have 0 Friends

200
At fudge factory for a field trip, A tour guide shows Mr. Garrison's class around the factory
Tour Guide
Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk.
Cartman
Wow, coo'.. [snaps a picture] Chocolate rules!
Kyle
You should know, fatass.
Cartman
AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
Stan
Oh God, you guys, really? This again? [the students all move to the next spot in the tour]
Tour Guide
And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.
Kyle
Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
Cartman
I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
Stan
You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! [everyone moves on except Butters, who spots something]
Butters
Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?
Stan
Huh? [Tom Cruise is packing fudge into boxes with a hat pulled low over his face] Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
Tom Cruise
What did you call me?
Cartman
Hey, that is Tom Cruise! [snaps a picture]
Butters
How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?
Tom Cruise
I'm not a fudge packer!
Kyle
Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
Tom Cruise
But I'm not a fudge packer! [packs a block of fudge into a box]
Stan
Then why are you packing fudge?
Tom Cruise
I'm not. I am a very busy actor who is trying to get away for a week and do some fly fishing! [pushes more fudge into boxes]
Stan
Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
Tom Cruise
Oh, that does it. I will SUE you!
Stan
For what?
Tom Cruise
You can't just call somebody a fudge packer and get away with it! [Mr. Garrison walks over]
Mr. Garrison
Hey, is that fudge-packer Tom Cruise?
Tom Cruise
That's it! [throws his hat away] I'm suing this entire intolerant town!
Stan
But dude-
Tom Cruise
No buts! If you want to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences!
At Tom Cruise's mountain lodge, a big crowd of celebrities has gathered.
Tom Cruise
Guys, I want to really thank you all for coming. Shockingly, I've just been slandered once again in the town of South Park, something I know you can all relate to. [all celebrities nod and agree]
Tiger Woods
That town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies!
Bono
I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!
Tom Cruise
Yeah, well I was just over there doing a little fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer! [The celebrities all are shocked and appealed] I know, right? And then other kids in the town and their teacher start joining in. [Sally Struthers is taking up the whole couch, except for the small place of an annoyed Mickey Mouse.]
Sally Struthers
South Park, Colorado, is the most racist, insensitive, and bigoted place in this country! [George Lucas holding onto a ball-gagged Indiana Jones]
George Lucas
That place thinks they can say whatever they want about us and get away with it!
Paris Hilton
If anyone has a gripe against that shithole, it's me! [coughs up some semen, then rubs it on John Travolta's crotch]
Tom Cruise
Yeah, well I say enough. All of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all! No longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want.
All Celebrities
YEAH!
Jared Fogle
Hey, Tom. I ate too much Subway. Where's your bathroom?
Tom Cruise
Oh, just the door down the hall there, Jared. [Jared opens the door to find a closet] No, no, no, that's a closet. Go down more. [Jared opens another door, which is also a closet.] No that's a closet too. [Jared opens a door, and once again it is a closet] Nope, Jared. That's a closet too. [Jared opens another door, it is another closet] No. [Jared opens two more doors, both closets] That's a closet... No that- that's a closet too.
At South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class.
Principal Victoria
[over the PA system] Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!
Kyle
Dude, what did you do?
Stan
I have no idea...
Walks into Victoria's office to discover his parents, the mayor, the counselor, Kyle's parents, and the police
Randy
You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
Principal Victoria
Did you call him a fudge packer?
Stan
Aww... he was packing fudge!
Mayor
Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!
Mr. Mackey
They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!
Stan
It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
Principal Victoria
But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.
Gerald
Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!
Sgt. Yates
Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!
Randy
Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
Back at the fudge factory, Tom Cruise is busy packing fudge as Stan and Randy stand behind him. Stan has taken off his hat and looks at the floor guiltily.
Randy
Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
Tom Cruise
That's nice! [punches the button to take away fudge he just packed] I'm still suing you all! Nobody calls me a fudge packer! [pushes fudge into a box]
Randy
Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... [Tom Cruise turns around]
Tom Cruise
WHAT?
Randy
We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
Tom Cruise
I am an actor. I do not pack fudge! [turns around and throws a piece of fudge into a box angrily]
Randy
Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says "Fred's Fudge and Candies"... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. [Tom Cruise sighs and backs away from his fudge packing station]
Tom Cruise
Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit.
Randy
ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.
Tom Cruise
It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-
Randy
Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.
Tom Cruise
Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith.
Stan
Ooooooo...
Randy
That's... tricky...
Tom Cruise
Well then you can just get sued! [Returns to packing fudge]
Randy
Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-
Tom Cruise
No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear or your little town is DONE!
South Park Town Meeting Hall. Angry chatter is heard while Randy is speaking to the audience, with Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mayor and her aides sitting on chairs beside him.
Randy
Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
Mr. Garrison
Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! [audience shouts in agreement]
Stephen
Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.
Kyle
[to Token] Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
Mr. Mackey
But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?
Sgt. Yates
Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like. [shows the whole audience. Stan in the middle raises his hand]
Stan
I saw him once. [everyone turns towards Stan]
McDaniels
[steps forward] You did?
Stan
Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?
Stan
No, dude, it was totally fine.
Sgt. Yates
Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?
Stan
Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
Randy
Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. [holds up a file and begins to open it]
Mr. Garrison
No, don't! [Randy holds it up to reveal a poorly drawn stick figure] Is that okay to show?
Jimbo
I don't know. I guess we'll see.
Tom Cruise's Lodge
Hillary Clinton
Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense!
Jesse Jackson
Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park.
Tom Cruise
No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?
Oprah Winfrey
You want Muhammad because he can't be ridiculed?
Tom Cruise
Muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of. What if we could harness that power? [moves over to Jimmy Buffet] Jimmy Buffet, how would you like it if no-one could ever call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage?
Jimmy Buffett
I... I'd love it!
Tom Cruise
By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule. [walks to the bar next to Tim Burton] Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately. There'd never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since Beetlejuice. And, you put Johnny Depp and all the same crappy music in every film. And if you're that in love with Johnny Depp, then you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that!
Tim Burton
Gee, that'd be swell.
Tom Cruise
Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take that power from him. [Cartman walks in]
Cartman
Excuse me... [the celebrities turn around] This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
Tom Cruise
Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!
Cartman
I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
Michael Richards
Who? [Cartman lifts up his hand and takes off his glove, revealing fake hair and painted on lips. It is Jennifer Lopez.]
Jennifer Lopez
Alllloooo... [celebrities gasp]
Tom Cruise
Jennifer Lopez! [celebrities crowd around saying hellos to Jennifer]
Jennifer Lopez
Yes, I am Hennifer Lopez, and I like tacos and burritos.
Turns into the opening theme for the Super Best Friends Show. As religious figures pop onto the screen, the one to the left of the middle is blocked with a giant bar reading CENSORED
Narrator
In the great hall of the Super Best Friends, there are assembled the leaders of the world's greatest religions; Jesus! [Jesus smiles and hammers a wood board] Buddha! [Buddha pries apart the screen] Krishna! [Krishna snaps his fingers and becomes a beaver] Muhammad! [Muhammad is walking down a street, but he has been replaced with a giant bar reading CENSORED] Lao Tzu and Joseph Smith [Walking down a corridor like the opening of Scooby Doo] and... the mighty Semen! [The word "Seaman" appears on the screen, but he says semen]
Seaman
It's not semen, it's Seaman!
Narrator
[covering up a laugh] Their mission; right that which is wrong, and to serve all mankind.
Stan and Kyle are sitting at a table, surrounded by the Super Best Friends except for Muhammad.
Stan
Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
Jesus
My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.
Buddha
We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people
Stan
Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
Narrator
Back in the hall of the Super Best Friends...
Kyle
Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
Joseph Smith
No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face.
Kyle
K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
Lao Tzu
No, cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble.
Stan
Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
Jesus
But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.
Kyle
Aww come on! This is ridiculous! [pounds hands on table]
Joseph Smith
Boys, you need to understand that people get very offended when Muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure. [snorting noise, Buddha is snorting cocaine]
Jesus
Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! [Kyle and Stan stare open mouthed for a second]
Kyle
A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
Joseph Smith
But he's talking from the U-Haul?
Stan
Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
Jesus
Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? [Moses is floating over in the previously unseen corner]
Moses
Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?
Kyle
There doesn't have to be...
Moses
Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay.
Tom Cruises Lodge, celebrities file into a large room which has a machine on the wall
Tom Cruise
Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of.
Russel Crowe
Tom, Tom, you're talkin' crazy mate. Only Muhammad has that ability, how could we ever get it from him? [Rob Reiner walks in with a huge sandwich and handkerchief]
Rob Reiner
We take his goo! It's as simple as that friends. [takes a bite and wipes forehead, then walks over near Tom Cruise]
Tom Cruise
Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth.
Rob Reiner
Any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another. [wipes forehead, holds up his hand, but speaks to himself]
Cartman
Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
Tom Cruise
No Jen, we all have got enough money.
Jennifer Lopez
Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva!
Cartman
Uh, excuse us for a second... [walks away]
Cartman enters an empty room and closes the door
Cartman
Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
Jennifer Lopez
What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo!
Cartman
Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
Jennifer Lopez
Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you!
Cartman
If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are... [looks at his hand, then removes his hand's hairpiece] Mitch Conner.
Mitch Conner
If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid.
Cartman
You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
Mitch Conner
Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.
Cartman
Yeah, so what?
Mitch Conner
You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.
Cartman
So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
Mitch Conner
You catch on quick kid... [knock at the door]
Tom Cruise
[from the other side of the door] Mrs. Lopez...
Mitch Conner
Hurry, get my wig back on! [Tom opens the door]
Tom Cruise
Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god [scratches the back of his head guiltily] you found my fudge packing uniform...
Jennifer Lopez
Oh, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!
Outside South Park Town Hall, several townspeople are standing around
Randy
Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
Mayor
Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad. [steps forward toward Muhammad, who is in a giant U-Haul]
Muhammad
[in a small voice] Welcome.
Mr Garrison
Oh, is that okay?
Jimbo
I don't know.
Randy
Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
Stan
What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
Gerald
Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
Kyle
But Muhammad can't be seen dad.
Sgt. Yates
Alright, we'll put a sheet over him.
Stan
No, you can't even show his feet.
Sheila
How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
Mr. Garrison
No, you could still see his eyes...
Randy
Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? [Mayor walks over to U-Haul and shouts inside]
Mayor
Muhammad, would that be OK?
Muhammad
[still small voice] OK.
Tom Cruise's Lodge
Hillary Clinton
Tom, Rob, we've just received word from the lawyers. South Park is saying they have Muhammad for us! [celebrities gasp]
Tom Cruise
Rob, will the machine be ready?
Rob Reiner
Oh, it'll be ready! [hits buttons on the machine's control panel]
Jennifer Lopez
[out of view] More tacos!
Jennifer Lopez
[in-view, the celebrities all turn around to look] More tacos!
Cartman
No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
Jennifer Lopez
More tacos.
Cartman
You just had seven tacos.
Jennifer Lopez
I want more tacos! [Cartman gives a nervous laugh]
Cartman
I'm sorry [whisper] Why are you doing this?
Jennifer Lopez
I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live!
Cartman
[whispering] You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! [Charlie Sheen steps forward]
Charlie Sheen
Mrs. Lopez, I can go. What do you want, like three tacos?
Jennifer Lopez
Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too?
Cartman
Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
Jennifer Lopez
Yes they do!
Cartman
I tried getting one last week!
Jennifer Lopez
Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them.
Cartman
God, will somebody shut her up?
South Park Town Square, several people still standing around when a limo pulls up
Randy
[facing away from view] Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. [A giant bear costume has been thrown over Muhammad]
Mayor
You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. [walks towards the limo]
Mr. Garrison
[from a distance away] Hold on a second! [runs over to the mayor]
Mr. Garrison
Stop! There's some extremists, threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they're gonna bomb us!
Mayor
What?!
Randy
Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on, we don't wanna piss off Tom Cruise again. [starts walking to the limo]
Jared Fogle and Phil Collins sit in the limo
Jared Fogle
[On a walkie-talkie] Alright, we got him Tom. [Everyone outside walks toward the limo, when it suddenly explodes]
Stan
Muhammad, are you okay? [Runs toward Muhammad and helps him up]
Randy
What the hell was that?!
Sgt. Yates
Obviously the terrorists are for real! [notices a paper Garrison is holding] What does that paper say? [reads the paper aloud] We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.
Stan
They want his power?
Kyle
What kind of extremists are these? [Yates looks over the note]
Sgt. Yates
You won't believe it...
The Hilton hotel's party room, which is full of red headed people, or gingers.
Lead Ginger
Our time is near! Soon, gingers will never be made fun of again!
All Gingers
[in unison] Huzzah!
Cartman walking down a street, keeping his hand away from himself. He has taken off Mitch Conner's fake hairpiece.
Mitch Conner
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Cartman
I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. [Mitch goes in front of Cartman]
Mitch Conner
You gonna walk away from 50 mil? [Cartman stops]
Cartman
Let me by...
Mitch Conner
You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.
Cartman
Screw this Conner. [pushes his hand away and moves on] Find yourself another partner.
Mitch Conner
Then I guess I won't tell you about your father. [Cartman stops]
Cartman
My father...
Mitch Conner
Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?
Cartman
I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
Mitch Conner
You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along. [Cartman turns around to face Conner]
Cartman
How could you know anything about who my family is?
Mitch Conner
Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return.
Cartman
If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
Mitch
You just take me where I tell you, and when you learn the truth, you will learn to trust me. And nobody else...
Chaos, people running around the street screaming
Barbrady
Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.
Mayors Office, McDaniels is pacing while the police stand around her
Sgt. Yates
Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!
Mayor
Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!
Jimbo
We have to give in to their demands.
McDaniels
I'm sorry Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over the gingers.
Kyle
We can't give him over to the gingers!
Stan
Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
Gerald
But our homes and our lives are at stake.
Stan
We made a promise... to Jesus! [Randy steps forward]
Randy
Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. [phone rings, everyone turns to look at it]
Jimbo
That'll be Tom Cruise... [Randy steps forward and slowly picks it up]
Randy
Helllo?
Tom Cruise
Yeah, so whats going on?
Randy
Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
Tom Cruise
What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?!
Randy
There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.
Tom Cruise
Gingers?
Kanye West
Gingers? Aww, hell no.
Randy
Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
Tom Cruise
You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence?
Randy
Well, yeah.
Tom Cruise
Oh, we can play that game too! You want to see violence, well you got it! [throws the phone at the ground and walks away]
Tom Cruise
[pacing around and fuming] Goddamn stupid assholes! You want to play rough?! OK! Spielburg, go and get some automatic rifles! We'll go in there, and we're going to take [around here, he jumps up and down on the couch, shouting his idea, with Oprah on the other cushion] Muhammad by force! And then we are going to show them th- [Rob Reiner rushes up]
Rob Reiner
Tom, Tom. We can't be seen getting violent.
Hillary Clinton
Yeah, that would kill all our careers!
Tom Cruise
[still jumping up and down on the couch] But the only way we are going to get Muhammad from South Park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers!
Rob Reiner
Fine, then let's have Her do it.
Tom Cruise
[stops jumping] Her who?
Rob Reiner
[whisper] You know... Her.
Tom Cruise
Oh right... [Whispers] Her.
In the middle of nowhere, limos start pulling up and celebrities all walk up to a huge structure
Rob Reiner
There she is Tom... Barbra Streisand.
Zooms around Mecha-Streisand, showing her from every angle
Robert Redford
My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember.
Steven Spielberg
Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this?
Tom Cruise
Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us.
Rob Reiner
Power her up! Release the Kraken! [Mel Gibson pushes a button, then flips a switch, starting up Mecha-Streisand]
Mecha-Streisand opens up her eyes, the Diamond on her forehead lights up, and her claws and arm saw are flexed. The gates open and she steps out to meet the celebrities. The song Barbra, Barbra is played. She kneels down and lets out a screech.
Rob Reiner
[extremely casual voice] Hey Barbra. It's me, Rob Reiner. [Barbra kneels down and blows steam out of her nose, the celebrities shield their faces]
Rob Reiner
Listen, Babs, we are taking on the town of South Park and we really need your help
Tom Cruise
We figured you're pissed at South Park too, right Mrs. Streisand? [Barbra roars, turns around, and slashes the holding tower with her arm saw]
Tom Cruise
Oh, she's pissed all right.
Someone's house, there is a knock at the door. The door opens, and Eric is standing outside.
Mr. Garrison
Eric, what are you doing here?
Cartman
Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
Mr. Garrison
What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-
Cartman
I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
Mr. Garrison
Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-
Cartman
I said GET. Mr. Hat!
Garrison's bedroom. He reaches into a drawer and pulls out Mr. Hat.
Cartman
Put it on! [he puts it on] Do the voice.
Mr. Hat
Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat. [Cartman pulls his hand from behind his back, revealing Mitch.]
Mitch Conner
Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?
Mr. Hat
I... I don't believe I know you.
Mitch Conner
The name's Mitch Conner, I flew the same division as you back in Saigon. [Mr. Garrison lowers Mr. Hat]
Mr. Garrison
Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
Cartman
Keep... your hand... UP!
A street filled with lots of townspeople, Muhammad, and Stan
Randy
[shouting to the other side of the street] Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. [huge group of gingers, all holding detonators]
Lead Ginger
Nuh uh, first you gotta prove that that is still Muhammad in there! Have him step out of the bear costume...
Townspeople
Ohhhhhhh...
Stan
Dude, we can't do that
Lead Ginger
Show us it's Muhammad or South Park is finished!
Back to Mr. Garrison's bedroom
Mr. Hat
Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!
Mitch Conner
So you admit it. There was a cover up. [Mr. Garrison turns away]
Mr. Garrison
No Mr. Hat, don't say any more!
Mitch
Yeah, tell 'im whatcha know!
Garrison
Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with.
Cartman
By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
Flash to townspeople on the street, then flash to gingers on the street then flash to Mecha-Streisand roaring
End of 200

201
Saigon, 1972, day. U.S. Army helicopters fly overhead. A gunner fires into the fields below
Mitch Conner
Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death. [Vietnamese and American soldiers fire at each other] A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see. [Wounded American soldiers are carried back to the helicopters] I tried to sit it out as much as I could. [a left arm exactly like Cartman's is shown. It wears dog tags, a tiny helmet, and camouflage face paint]
Soldier 1
What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood?
Mitch Conner
No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner.
Soldier 2
Incoming! [An RPG flies into the helicopter and blows up. Cut to a MASH unit, where Mitch opens his eyes]
Army Doctor
Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son.
Mitch Conner
And that's that. "Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam." [cut to the present, where Mitch is now on Cartman's arm facing Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat.] So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher.
Mr. Garrison
Eric I, [faces Cartman] I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.
Mitch Conner
Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
Cartman
That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
Mr. Garrison
[turns away] All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.
South Park. night. The townsfolk and the gingers face off.
Randy
Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
Ginger 1
We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick.
Stan
It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
Ginger 1
Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One!
Jimbo
Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.
Ginger 1
Two!
Sgt. Yates
Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed.
Ginger 1
Three!
Randy
Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say. [turns to the bear] I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? [the bear looks around, then unzips the costume. A familiar red suit and black belt appear. The arms flail a bit and the costume drops away. Santa has stepped out of the costume.]
Stan
Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.
Ginger 2
That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus.
Santa
Sorry, boys. I tried.
Kyle
Aw crap.
Randy
Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
Stan
When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
Mr. Hankey
[hops up to Kyle] I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.
Stan
If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
Ginger 1
So where is he?! [heavy footfalls and a mechanical roar are heard, and everyone gets afraid.]
Hall of Super Best Friends, night.
Announcer
Meanwhile, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends...
Inside. Buddha is snorting coke again.
Jesus
Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.
Buddha
Ohhh, and you're one to talk! With all your Internet porn!
Jesus
Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag!
Joseph Smith
[runs into the meeting room] Jesus Christ!
Jesus
What?
Joseph Smith
We've got a distress signal coming in. [the Super Best Friends leave their seats and head for the towering screen at one end of the room]
Jesus
On the Super Best Screen!
Police Officer
Super Best Friends! You've got to help us! The Casa Bonita is under attack! [Casa Bonita is shown. Soldiers defend it by firing at Mecha-Streisand, but she just keeps walking towards it]
Jesus
Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand! [Mecha-Streisand picks up a car and bites the front end off. The driver drops down from it, likely to his death]
Lao Tse
I thought Barbra Streisand had been destroyed by Robert Smith.
Seaman
Yeah. Who would have activated her again?
Jesus
I don't know, Seaman. [the other Super Best Friends chuckle]
Seaman
[annoyed] It's Sea-Man! [the other Super Best Friends chuckle, but their attention is again drawn to the screen. ]
Police Officer
The Casa Bonita is gone! Jesus help us!
Jesus
Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her! [he leads the others to Docking Bay Alpha] On the Super Best Friends power cycles! [moments later, amid a cloud of steam, a platform rises, and the Super Best Friends roll off it on modified Segways.]
South Park Genetic Engineering - Dr. Mephesto's lab. Dr. Mephesto is inside working on an animal.
Dr. Mephesto
There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of. [the top of his assistant's head is shown moving towards him] Ah, Kevin. You brought me my Fonseca. That's a good boy. [a pounding is heard at the door and both men turn around] What's this? Someone is at the door, Kevin. [the pounding is heard again] We tried to be left alone, Kevin. Who would disturb us at this hour? We must be careful. [looks through the peep hole] Why, it's an African-American man, Kevin. [to the person outside] Yes? What do you want?
Person
[Mitch Conner, in blackface, wearing a wig] Yo man, sorry to bother you, but there's been an accident down the street, man. Can I use your telephone?
Dr. Mephesto
Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in.
Person
Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog!
Dr. Mephesto
There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.
Person
Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house.
Dr. Mephesto
No, please, it isn't that at all.
Person
No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone.
Dr. Mephesto
No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in. [opens the door, which is built like that of a bank vault]
Cartman
[quickly gets in] Ahaaa!
Dr. Mephesto
WAAH!
Kevin
AAAH!
Cartman
Nice work, Conner.
Mitch Conner
Yeah, the old "Hasn't anything changed?" speech. Works on white people all the time.
Dr. Mephesto
Eric Cartman?
Cartman
Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
South Park, night. Mecha-Streisand rounds a corner as the townsfolk run away from her
Santa
[in the crowd] Holy crap! [as the crowd disappears, one lone boy walks towards the robot...]
Pip
Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits. [the robot walks towards him and he turns and runs] Haaah! [Mecha-Streisand crushes him under her left foot]
Tom Cruise's mansion, night.
Announcer
Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom, which is Tom Cruise's house.
Tom Cruise
How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!
Randy
[on the community center roof with other townsfolk] Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off! [everyone cringes as Mecha-Streisand walks around] She's destroying everything!
Tom Cruise
We will call her off when you give us Muhammad!
Randy
We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
Tom Cruise
That's your problem! Get him back or Babs will kill you all!
Mickey Mouse
Oh boy!
South Park, night. The crowd runs down the street. Stan and Kyle see Kenny between two buildings and run up to him
Stan
Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
Kenny
(I am. He's right here.) [a locker to his left opens up and Muhammad steps out, a black rectangle with "CENSORED" on it covering him up]
Stan
Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.
Kyle
Really sorry about all this, dude. [to Stan] So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
Stan
The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
Kyle
[thinks a bit, then snaps his fingers] Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
Kenny
(What?)
Kyle
Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
Stan
[a bit surprised] ...Yeah.
Kyle
I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! [they all run off]
Raisins, night. Mecha-Streisand's right foot is on the parking lot next to an overturned car. Her left foot comes down on the restaurant and everyone inside runs out. She then moves on to Country Kitchen buffet and crushes that under her right foot. All the elderly folk get out of there right before it's destroyed.
Richard Tweek
She's going to get our coffee store next.
Mr. Slave
Ooooo, Jesus Christ. [points to behind the camera. The Super Best Friends roll into town on their cycles]
Jesus
That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa! [takes off his halo and hurls it at her. It bounces off her left shoulder and returns to Jesus. Barbra just gets more pissed off and turns to face Jesus. She walks towards him] Smith! Try your ice breath! [Joseph Smith steps forward and blows a stream of freezing air at Barbra's left claw. She looks at it and flexes her claws]
Joseph Smith
No good!
Seaman
Look out! Barbra Streisand is using her toxic stink ray! [Barbra unleashes a stream of brown gas from her genital area, making the Super Best Friends cough]
Dr. Mephesto's lab, later
Dr. Mephesto
Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them.
Cartman
Them who?!
Dr. Mephesto
Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.
Cartman
Then start explaining it to me!
Dr. Mephesto
[heavy sigh] Very well.
Kyle
Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.
Stan
Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!
Dr. Mephesto
Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in! [goes to the door and locks it]
Kyle
Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
Dr. Mephesto
Oh, all right.
Cartman
No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
Stan
Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
Cartman
It's all that matters!
Kyle
Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
Cartman
I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
South Park, night. Joseph Smith has taken flight
Announcer
In the small mountain town of South Park, the holy prophet of the Mormon religion is trying to fly up the nose of a deadly female singer. [Barbra Streisand looks around. Krishna and Seaman float by either side of her head. Smith lands on her nose, but she tries to shake him off]
Seaman
Our powers aren't working, Swallow. [The Super Best Friends float down towards Jesus]
Joseph Smith
We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!
Jesus
We have to find another weak spot! [into his cuff] Moses!
Moses
What?
Jesus
We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!
Moses
Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond.
Jesus
All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman, [chuckles] you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. [the other Super Best Friends start chuckling]
Seaman
It's Sea-Man and Swallow.
Jesus
Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!
Seaman
Fine! Swallow, come. [the other Super Best Friends chuckle]
Moses
Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that.
Dr. Mephesto's lab
Stan
Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
Dr. Mephesto
It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.
Kyle
Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
Mitch Conner
Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?
Kyle
Oh, you are not doing that again!
Mitch Conner
Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!
Kyle
Stop talking with your stupid hand!
Cartman
Who you calling stupid, Jew?
Stan
Come on, guys, we're running out of time! [more knocking is heard at Mephesto's door, and Mephesto turns around]
Dr. Mephesto
Yes?
Man
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.
Dr. Mephesto
Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American.
Man
...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.
Dr. Mephesto
Beat it I'm not helpin' you!
Kyle
Dude!
Stan
That's not cool!
Dr. Mephesto
No no, you don't understand.
Kyle
We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
Stan
We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
Dr. Mephesto
Alright, alright, jeez. [walks to the door and opens it]
Ginger 1
Hahaaa!
Stan
Oh crap, the gingers!
Cartman
Gingers? No!
Tom Cruise's mansion
Announcer
L-later, at the Legion of Doom.
Benedict XVI
Tom, Tom! The gingers are claiming they have Muhammad!
Tom Cruise
What?! Impossible!
Benedict XVI
They are sending a message now!
Tom Cruise
On screen! [The Legion of Doom's monitor lights up and the gingers are shown with Muhammad. The lead ginger gives the Legion a raspberry.]
Ginger 1
[taunting] We got Muhammad! We got Muhammad!
Rob Reiner
He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine!
Ginger 1
Why do you think we're calling?!
Ginger 3
Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us!
Tom Cruise
...Your ...boss?
The gingers' lair
Dr. Mephesto
What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go.
Ginger 1
Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you!
Stan
What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!
Ginger 2
Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him.
The gingers' lair, deeper inside. Cartman walks through the cave with a flashlight.
Cartman
Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
Mitch Conner
You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.
Cartman
Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
Mitch Conner
You might wanna [garbled sounds as Cartman puts the flashlight in his left hand]
Cartman
Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. [a slow cackle rises from the darkness]
A Voice
Eric Cartman. I've waited a long time for this.
Cartman
Daddy?
A Voice
Guess again. [lights go one a few at a time. Carnival rides begin to appear. The Bean Dip Ferris Wheel. Chili-buster. The Chiliblast. A Hot Chili sign. A Professor Habanero chili booth. More signs come on, and the 2010 Chili Con Carnival is now live. Cartman is awed] Welcome, to my Chili Con Carnival.
Cartman
[strokes his chin and thinks] Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
A Voice
Oh, but it can. [Cartman is looking at a throne with a staircase at its base. Six gingers stand guard on the ground and halfway up the steps. Around and behind the steps is a pile of broken baby dolls highlighted by two torches. one on either side of the stairs. The torches are topped with baby doll heads. On the throne itself sits one Scott Tenorman, with top hat and cane. His head is in the shadows] Revenge is a dish best served... [leans forward into the light] chili.
Cartman
Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
South Park, night. "Live! Tonight Only! NEIL DIAMOND"
Announcer
Meanwhile, at the concert stage Jesus built with his power of super-carpentry...
Joseph Smith
[walks in with Buddha and Lao Tse] That's it, Jesus. The band has been paid and the PA system is working.
Jesus
[joins them and drops his hammer] Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you.
Krishna
[walks some distance] Form of... Neil Diamond. [poof! He is now Neil Diamond, who then goes on stage and addresses the crowd] If you all wouldn't mind, I'd like to invite a special friend to join me on stage. Miss Barbra Streisand! [Barbra hears her name and walks towards the stage]
Jesus
Let's hope to Christ this works. [Barbra reaches the stage and lowers her head to Neil - er, Krishna]
Krishna
Hello gorgeous. What do you say? Shall we sing together again like the old times?
[Barbra roars and sits down on stage] 
Well that's because I love the girl. 
And I still love you now. What have you got to say? 
[Barbra roars, then the crowd roars] 
That might be true, but I still miss ya at night. 
[Barbra roars something] 
When you roll over, by my side, and you kiss me goodnight. 
[This excites Barbra, who roars and lets out a jet of toxic spray onto the audience. The audience members cough and try to shield themselves]

Joseph Smith
It worked, Jesus!
Jesus
Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!
Scott Tenorman's' lair
Scott Tenorman
Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric. [two ginger kids come and escort Cartman towards a ride] A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father. [the two kids place Cartman in a car and sit on either side of him. The car begins to move. Screen 1] Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be? [Screen 2] You've been lied to by everyone! [Screen 3] Even by your own mother! [Screen 4] Hahahahahahahaha. [the car goes through some double doors]
Cartman
What do you know?!
Scott Tenorman
[Screen 5] I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed!
The gingers' lair. The goo machine has been moved there and Muhammad has been strapped into the lefthand side of the machine. Tom Cruise has been strapped to the right side
Announcer
[sounding more and more wasted] Meanwhile, at the gingers' lair...
Russell Crowe
Alright, Muhammad is secure. [moves off the machine]
Tom Cruise
Let's do this. Throw the switch, Rob. [Rob Reiner throws the switch. The power level increases on the control panel. Moments later, goo moves from Muhammad through four tubes towards a mixer, then through two tubes towards Tom Cruise. Everyone watches in anticipation] Ohhh. Uhhh. Yes! I can feel it! I can feel the power to not be ridiculed flowing through my veins! [shakes violently for a second, then the machine shuts down. A "CENSORED" bar appears over Tom] Ha. Hahahaha! [laughs heartily]
Paris Hilton
O M G it worked!
Tom Cruise
I've done it! I've done it! Look at me! I'm not okay to make fun of anymore!
Benedict XVI
Ooo you lucky fucker.
Chili Con Carnival - Scott Tenorman's lair. Scott has brought in Stan, Kyle, and Kenny, some gingers, and some candidates from Dr. Mephesto's DNA inquiry into Cartman's dad. Dr. Mephesto and Kevin are there too. Scott is inside a center ring next to a table on which rests a bowl of chili. Cartman is on a chair facing the bowl. Only the gingers have their hands free. Everyone else has their hands tied behind their backs
Scott Tenorman
Welcome, everyone, to the final act of my fabulous Chili Carnival!
Liane
Please, leave my boy alone!
Cartman
Mom?
Scott Tenorman
I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!
Mr. Garrison
Please don't. We have to protect 'em.
Cartman
Protect who??
Scott Tenorman
Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr... [points to] Jimbo! [with his cane]
Jimbo
Protect... the Denver Broncos.
The gingers' lair
Announcer
Meanwhile...
Tom Cruise
This is incredible. Who wants to go next?
Benedict XVI
I want to be next.
Ginger 4
No, gingers go next.
Mickey Mouse
Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha!
Rob Reiner
It's my goo machine! I'm next!
Jesus
Nobody is going next! [Jesus, Buddha, and Joseph Smith run in while Lao Tse and Seaman drop in from above.] Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!
Ginger 4
They can't stop all of us! Get 'em!
The gingers and celebrities attack the super best friends as one. Joseph Smith blows his super breath on Sally Struthers, who freezes over.
Jesus
[fends off every ginger who runs at him.] Kyaaaaa!
Chili Con Carnival - Scott Tenorman's lair. Scott addresses the captives
Scott Tenorman
The Denver Broncos. [turns to Cartman] There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name!
Mr. Garrison
They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
Cartman
My dad was a Denver Bronco?
Scott Tenorman
Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?
Cartman
No- nooo.
Scott Tenorman
The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!
Liane
No please!
Scott Tenorman
[to Dr. Mephesto] Tell him! You almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him!
Dr. Mephesto
It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.
Scott Tenorman
You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!
Cartman
No! Noooo!
Scott Tenorman
Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Now eat your chili! [shoves Cartman's face into the chili, just as Cartman had done to him a long time ago. Cartman gags on the chili. A wall explodes and the captives and celebrities rush in, followed by the Super Best Friends] The Super Best Friends? Oh no! [makes a run out of the lair. Russell Crowe smacks Buddha a few times, but Buddha fights back]
Seaman
I'll get you, Tom Cruise! [hops on him and wrestles him]
Stan
Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. [everyone stops and gasps. The "CENSORED" bar disappears and Tom is shown again]
Tom Cruise
What did you say?!
Kyle
Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
Jesus
I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman. [everyone chuckles.]
Tom Cruise
[straightens up] Whoawhoa whoa whoa! [Seaman gets off his back] You're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore! What the hell's going on?!
Scott Tenorman
[on the rafters with a jet pack on his back] I'll be back, Super Best Friends! [tales off through an open door on the roof.]
Jesus
Who's the creepy ginger kid?
Tom Cruise
Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!
Kyle
That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
Jesus
That's right. Don't you see, gingers? If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.
Santa
That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.
Stan
[smiles and tilts his head to one side] Yeah.
South Park, day. Reconstruction on the town begins
Mayor McDaniels
Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.
Stan
Oh dude, look. [Cartman is shown on a gurney, crying. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him] Hey, Cartman...
Kyle
Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
Cartman
Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
Stan
Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
Cartman
My dad was a ginger!
Kyle
Wwait, what?
Cartman
I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
Kyle
Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
Mitch Conner
[appears] Hey Eric, Eric!
Cartman
What?
Mitch Conner
Come on, cheer up.
Cartman
Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
Mitch Conner
Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.
Cartman
Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
Kyle
You gotta be kidding me!
Mitch Conner
Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew. [to Cartman] You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on.
Cartman
Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
Mitch Conner
There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
Cartman
Take it easy, Conner. [his hand floats away, then opens up all of a sudden. He wiggles his fingers. Next shot is of Tom Cruise sitting by himself on a trash can.]
Stan
Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
Tom Cruise
I... I just can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.
Kyle
Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
Stan
We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!
Tom Cruise
You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh. [stands up] Oh please, can you show me where?
Stan
We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
The moon. Tom Cruise is shown laying next to Willzyx.

Towelie
[walking down the street being friendly] Hey everybody, how's it goin'?
The Towel
The Drug Addict
Towelie
[taking a hit from a bong] I just... I just can't seem to stop.
Towelie has agreed to be in a
 documentary about addiction
Towelie
Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. [coughs]
He does not know he is about
 to face an intervention
Towelie
[stumbling around, tattered and wasted] Get out of my face! Get out of here! [runs at the camera and shoves it out of his face. The camera spins around in a blur of lights]
Intervention
Towelie
[in studio] My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills. [a man spills his drink in a mall and Towelie throws himself at it, soaking it up. Next, he sends himself into a washing machine at a laundromat] And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways. [hangs himself up to dry on a clothesline in someone's backyard] Except for one. [back to the studio] I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. [next scene is a wasted Towelie taking another hit from his bong]
Nine years ago Towlie started
 smoking marijuana. Two years later he started
experimenting with crystal meth.
Towelie
[scorched and wasted, walks down the street] Hey buddy, want your dick sucked? [bends over for a moment] Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?
Stan
Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
Kyle
If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
Butters
[cries, taking a tissue from the box next to him] Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
Stan
There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! [Towelie is shown lighting a joint as the camera pulls away]
A Lake Tardicaca, Camp for the Handicapped, day. It sits by the side of a lake, and disabled campers mill around in it. Some campers sit around a campfire, others help set up tents, still others play in the lake. The following song plays as the scene is established
Singers
Are you ready for the summer?
Are you ready for the good times?
Are you ready for the birds and bees?
The apple trees?
And a whole lot of fooling around?
Are you ready for the summer?
Are you ready for the good times?
Are you ready for the birds and bees?
The apple trees?
And a whole lot of fooling around?
Are you ready for the fireflies,
the moonlit skies,
and a whole lot of fooling around

Timmy and Jimmy walk into camp. Jimmy sports some blue sunglasses. Both boys are dressed for swimming
Jimmy
Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year.
Timmy
Timmeh!
Jimmy
We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Francis. Hey Francis!
Francis
[practicing how to light a fire with a stick, a bow, and a small board] Hi Jimmy, hi Tim.
Timmy
[waves, grinning] Timmy.
Specialist 1
Wow, look at Lenora everyone. [Lenora dog-paddles her way to the shore] Good job. Come on, good job Lenora. Ahahall right, good, let's get Lenora a towel. [Lenora begins to shiver. The song ends at this point] Come on, come on, where's the towel?
Specialist 2
[looks inside the towel cart] The towel isn't here. I think it's off getting high again.
For the past week Towelie has
been working at a summer camp for handicapped children.

He has been given warnings

for getting high fourteen times.
Towelie is tying a rubber band around his upper right arm, preparing to inject himself
Specialist 3
[walks nearby looking for him] Hey! [startled, Towelie lets the rubber band snap off and fall to the ground] Where is that towel?!
Towelie
Oh yeah, just a sec. [the specialist sees him]
Stan
[in studio] We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us! [crosses his arms] Stupid towel!
Specialist 3
[now next to Towelie] What's going on, Towel?
Towelie
Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.
Specialist 3
We got wet campers down there! Move your ass!
Kyle
[in studio] When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
Towelie
[now wasted and tattered] I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. [walks by a campfire circle where Jimmy is holding court with his team]
Jimmy
Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition.
"Elmer Fudd"
Oh we're weady aww wight. We can weawwy stick it to the wed team this yeaw, wahahahaha.
"Beaky Buzzard"
No way, Red Team can beat us, no way. Haha, hahaha.
"Droopy Dawg"
Red Team won't know what hit them.
Jimmy
All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?
Blue Team
Yeah!
Timmy
Timmy!
Blue Team
Yeah! [a couple of members go on separately] Alright!
Nearby, Nathan and a huge boy listen in
Nathan
I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.
Mimsy
Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha.
Nathan
[smacks him with a right hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy!
Mimsy
Doh, sorry, boss.
Nathan
Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?
Blue Team has beaten Red Team
the past three summers at Lake Tardicaca.

The three legged race is Blue

Team's best event.
Nathan
What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.
Mimsy
Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss?
Nathan
[smacks him with a right hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him.
Specialist 1 has applied Towelie to Lenora, and Towelie gets her dry.
Specialist 1
There you go, Lenora, all better now?
Lenora
Yes, thanks.
Towelie
That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... [throws up all over Lenora]
Lenora
Uhhh!
Specialist 3
Who hired that towel? It can barely walk, let alone dry somebody off.
Towelie
[picking a fight] You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!
Stan
[in studio] A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
Towelie
You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! [walks off in disgust]
Butters
[in studio, sobbing] The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked. [a picture of the couple is shown, but her face is blurry. The picture was taken at a restaurant booth] And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth. [A picture of the three of them at the hospital. She shows off Washcloth, but her face is still blurry] Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
Towelie
[wasted. wandering in the woods] Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!
Towelie is attempting to talk
to his son.

His ex-wife will not let her son

talk to Towelie when he is high.
Towelie
No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday! [the anger leaves his face] Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?
Camp Tardicaca, day. One of the specialists stands next to an event scoreboard with ten events listed
Specialist 1
[over the megaphone] All right, campers! Our first event is the big canoe race!
"Pete Puma"
Oh boy, the canoe races! Heeee! [the team turns right and walks away]
"Porky Pig"
We gotta be uh bitty bitty uh we uh we gotta be we gotta be uh we gotta bibbity beat the Red Team. [turns and walks off with the others. Nearby, Nathan and Mimsy listen in again]
Nathan
I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.
Mimsy
Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss?
Nathan
Simple, Mimsy, [pulls out a bag with something in it] We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe.
Mimsy
Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh? [Nathan pulls a snake out of the bag by its head] Oh! It's a snake.
Nathan
Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a Black Mamba.
The Black Mamba is the deadliest
snake known to man.

The odds of surviving a Black Mamba in your canoe

are 546 to 1.
Mimsy
Aww, dah, jee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh? [Nathan shushes him]
Specialist 4
You boys excited for the canoe race?
Nathan
Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.
Specialist 4
[encouraged] Canoes are fun, aren't day? [walks away]
Nathan
[now that the counselor is gone...] Now take the Black Mamba, [hands the bag to Mimsy] Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready.
The teams have sat down inside their canoes
Specialist 1
All right, campers are we ready?
All
Yeah!
Nathan
Good luck, Jimmy.
Jimmy
You too, Ne-n-Nathan.
Nathan
You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole.
Specialist 1
Oh your mark, get set. [shoots off her gun, and both boats take off. Nathan switches his oar to his right side, but notices something on the floor: the Black Mamba Mimsy was to put in the other canoe.]
Nathan
Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!
Mimsy
Darrr, you said to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss.
Nathan
[shakes his fist] Not in our canoe, Mimsy!
Mimsy has put the Black Mamba
snake in the wrong canoe.

The odds of the Red Team winning the canoe race

are now 1 in 19.
Nathan's crew begins to bail on him, allowing the Blue Team to win this event
Lake Tardicaca. Steve rushes to a supply shack to get Towelie
Steve
[tries to open the door, but finds it locked] Heeey. Hey, we need a towel! [pounds on the door]
Towelie
Uh, oh, um, uh, just a sec!
Steve
Not just a sec! We've got a whole lot of wet campers down there! [tries to get the door open by throwing himself at it a few times] What's going on?! [kicks the door in and is instantly shocked at what he sees: Towelie on his knees in front of an elderly man who's pulling up his pants]
Towelie makes extra money
for drugs by offering oral

sex to older men
The man rushes out of the shack while the specialist remains speechless
Towelie
Hey, you own me money, asshole!
The camp office, later.
Specialist 1
That's it, we're done! You are no longer employed here!
Kyle
Please, sir.
Specialist 1
We need a nice, clean towel here at summer camp. We don't need a towel that shoots heroin and has sex for money!
Towelie
Heh, some people are so picky about their towels
Lake Tardicaca, later.
Specialist 3
All right campers, next event is the big scavenger hunt! Blue Team is gonna go first. [Nathan and Mimsy stand nearby, overhearing the specialist]
Nathan
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team.
Mimsy
Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh boss?
Nathan
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans. [reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a map] Here, take this. [Mimsy takes it and opens it up] It's a fake scavenger hunt map.
Mimsy
Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt?
Nathan
No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation.
The Tardicaca Indians are
extremely protective of their land.

Trespassing on the Tardicaca Reservation is considered

extremely dangerous.
Mimsy
Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss? [again Nathan shushes him as a specialist draws near to them]
Counselor Steve
Are you boys excited for the neat scavenger hunt?
Nathan
Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt. [Steve walks away] Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!
Mimsy
I got it, boss. Switch the map. Switch the map. [walks away]
Lake Tardicaca, day. Nathan leads his team into the woods for scavenging.
Mimsy
Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss?
Nathan
Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too.
Mimsy
Dahhhoh boy!
The boys find themselves in a clearing. Nathan takes a look around
Nathan
This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. "Turn left at the..." Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the? [finds his way onto the Tardicaca Burial Grounds] Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!
Mimsy
Why sure it is, boss.
Nathan
I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!
Mimsy
No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it. [his motions indicate he just flipped the map this way and that]
Nathan
Miiimmmssssyyyy! [all of a sudden, Indians appear on horseback.] Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled. [the Indians fire at him and arrows go flying all over the place. He's struck a few times.] AAAAA!
Intervention
Towelie is walking towards a Supply Max store
Towelie:
Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. [inside he grabs as many bottles of computer duster as he can]
Towelie has run out of money
for hard drugs.

He now inhales computer

uster to get high.
Cashier
You must have one dusty computer.
Towelie
[irritated] Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch! [goes to his red car outside, gets in, and closes the door. Inside he takes out a bottle of computer duster and starts sniffing. He goes through bottle after bottle, screwing up his face more and more] I feel like I could conquer the world.
Towelie now inhales up
to 2,000 cans of computer

duster a day.
Towelie
[taking a short break from his sniffing] It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.
Butters
[in studio] I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance. [at the Supply Max parking lot, walks up and kicks the door on Towelie's car] Towelie! Open the door!
Towelie
Go away! I'm walking on sunshine!
Butters
Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
Towelie
Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. [Butters waits]
Lake Tardicaca, day. The head specialist comes to announce some results
Specialist 1
[through the megaphone] All right! In the surfing competition, the Red Team is up three points to two. ["Elmer Fudd" puts his surfboard away] And now it's Jimmy Valmer's turn. [Jimmy goes out into the open water on his board]
Timmy
Timmeh!
Francis
Gee, I wish our team captain was as awesome as Jimmy. [The camera pans across the dock and on to Nathan and Mimsy]
Nathan
I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.
Mimsy
Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?
Nathan
Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark. [pulls out a small box in which is a whistle. He opens the box and takes out the whistle, and hads it to Mimsy] Here, take this. [Mimsy takes it, and Nathan puts the box back in his back pocket] It's a shark-mating whistle.
Mimsy
Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'
Nathan
No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.
The Tardicaca shark is the
deadliest freshwater shark in Colorado.

A shark mating whistle can attract the shark from over two miles away.

* Colorado Department of Wildlife
Mimsy
Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off. [getting excited] Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death. [Nathan shushes him again as Steve walks by]
Steve
Are you boys enjoying the fun beach?
Nathan
Yes, Counselor Steve. The beach is warm. [Steve walks off]
Mimsy
Gee that was a close one, huh boss? They almost had me saying we were gonna kill Jimmy.
Nathan
[smacks him with a left hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle.
Mimsy
Dohh boy! [walks away to complete his mission]
On the lake, Jimmy is set to surf to shore. He waits for a wave. On the shore...
"Pete Puma"
Yeah I don't know, Timmy. Those waves are pretty big, heeeee.
Timmy
Timmih.
"Beaky Buzzard"
Uhuhuh. Don't worry, Jimmy can handle himself.
Jimmy
Gonna catch a wave... [no wave is coming. Underwater, Mimsy swims by]
Mimsy
Dahhh I got me a shark whistle.
Jimmy
Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes! [a wave rises high behind him and lifts him with it, then crashes down over and in front of him]
"Droopy Dawg"
Oh no! Jimmy!
"Elmer Fudd"
Wait, look! He's doing it! [Jimmy rises to the top and the campers cheer. He's doing all the surfing moves. Meanwhile, Mimsy comes out of the water and walks up to Nathan.]
Mimsy
Dohoho, oh boy!
Nathan
Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you.
Mimsy
Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle. [blows hard into the whistle]
Mimsy was supposed to blow
the shark whistle while still under the water.

There appears to have been a

fundamental misunderstanding.
Mimsy blows the whistle a few more times
Nathan
You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it- [a shark jumps out of the water, lands on him, and begins to hump him] eh uh uh...
Mimsy's error has caused a Lake
Shark to come onto the beach and mate with Nathan.

The Tardicaca Lake Shark's penis is nine inches long.

* Colorado Department of Wildlife
Nathan
Mimsssyyy! Get this thing off of meee!
Intervention day
Stan
[in studio] Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
Butters
Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
Towelie thinks he is on
his way to the Laundromat.
Butters leads a battered and wasted Towelie to a door and opens the door. They walk into the room and see Clyde, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Stan, as well as a therapist, all waiting for them.
Towelie
Wha' what's goin' on?
Jeff VanVonderen
You wanna come over, have a seat with your friends? [Butters takes a seat between Kyle and Cartman, making space for Towelie to sit between him and Kyle. Towelie follows Butters to the sofa]
Towelie
What is everybody doing here?
Jeff VanVonderen
We've all just been talking, Towelie, and and what I'm hearing is a bunch of people here who just love the heck outtaya. And, they're gonna way what they wanna say, and you're gonna say what you wanna say, and we're done. Okay?
Butters
[reads from a note he wrote down earlier] Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
Towelie
Aw Jesus, man.
Jeff VanVonderen
Ah ah Towelie, you need to let him finish.
Butters
You're not the towel you used to be. [sniffles] Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
Towelie
I I don't, I don't get this.
Jeff VanVonderen
Kyle?
Kyle
[reads from a note he wrote down earlier] Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
Towelie
Could we just end this please?
Jeff VanVonderen
You have to let him finish, Towelie.
Kyle
If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
Jeff VanVonderen
Alright. Eric, do you wanna go next?
Cartman
[reads his note] Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
Kyle
We're here for Towelie, fatass!
Cartman
I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right? [clears his throat] The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- [Kyle walks over and rips the note from Cartman's hands]
Kyle
This is serious, you fucking asshole!
Cartman
I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
Jeff VanVonderen
Kyle, we have to let people be allowed to finish during interventions.
Kyle
But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
Jeff VanVonderen
Kyle please, It is not your turn!
Cartman
[takes his note back. Kyle walks back to his seat] You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society. [puts down that sheet, but reaches into his back pocket for another one] Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
Kyle
Oh my God!
Lake Tardicaca, night. Time for the Talent Show Competition! A Hawaiian song starts up. Jimmy is singing and playing ukulele
Jimmy
It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp to learn to do the hula hula dance
I fell in love with a Tardicaca dove while doin' that funny funny dance.
And that poor little kid, why she never did know what love had in store.
So I made up my mind-

Nathan
Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.
Nathan and Mimsy stand in the shadows with their fingers in their ears
Red Team planted half a pound
of C4 in Jimmy's ukulele.

It is set to go off during the ukulele solo of

'Tardicaca Hula Gal'
Jimmy
So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.
Campers
Wawawawander...

Jimmy
Hurr a little Tardicaca...

Campers
Hula...

Jimmy
She's a candy cane to wiggle

Campers
Hula...

Jimmy
She's sure to make you g-giggle.

Campers
Hula...

Jimmy
With her naughty little wiggle. I know someday

Campers
Hula...

Jimmy
I'm gonna try to make that Tardicaca gally mine, gally mine.
'Cause all the while I'm dreaming of her. My Tardicaca Hola Gal!

[begins playing the solo, but hits a B, which is off] Oh sorry, that's not right. Hang on. [tries playing it again, but this time hits an A. Behind some trees, Nathan and Mimsy look on]

Mimsy
Dahh I don't think he's playing the right note, boss. The C4 aint gonna go off.
Nathan
[smacks him with a right hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy!
Intervention. Cartman continues to speak and now has a pile of notes to his right about two feet tall, enough for twelve thick books
Cartman
If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. [puts the note on top of the pile and sits there quietly]
Jeff VanVonderen
Okay, Stan, you want to go next?
Stan
[reads his note] Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
Towel
What treatment?! What are you all talkin' about?!
Jeff VanVonderen
If you say yes, we leave here, pack your things, get on a plane, go to a treatment facility in Southern California, it's all set up.
Towelie
No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.
Jeff VanVonderen
Well Towelie, your friends don't wanna watch you kill yourself anymore.
Towelie
Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! [storms out of the intervention room]
Butters
[emotional] Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
Towelie
Who are you talkin' about?! [Butters pulls out Washcloth from his back pocket and cries] Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.
Lake Tardicaca, night. Jimmy is still singing "Tardicaca Hula Gal"
Jimmy
Out on the beach with my cute little peach where the waves are rolling in so high
Holding her hand, our feet on the sand-

Nathan
Dammit dammit!
Jimmy has skipped the ukulele
solo and moved on to the second verse of 'Tardicaca Hula Gal'.

This has set back Nathan's

plans immensely.
Nathan
Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.
Mimsy
Dahh okay boss. [goes towards the stage]
Jimmy
If you get in a pinch, go through, it's a cinch-
Mimsy
[at the stage] Darrr we want the ukulele solo! We want the ukulele solo!
Jimmy
Sorry Mims, I I just can't remember it.
Mimsy
Well we wants ya to play it, don't we?
Nathan
[behind the audience] Yeeeah!
Jimmy
Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done. [hands the ukulele to Mimsy]
Mimsy
[hesitates, then] Dahh okay. It's real easy. You just play it like this. [takes the ukulele and begins to play]
Nathan
[runs up and takes the ukulele from Mimsy] Mimsssyyy! You idio', wha' are you doin'?
Mimsy
D'I was gonna show him how to play the solo, boss.
Nathan
That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself! [plays the solo and hits the right note. The ukulele blows up, launching him into the air] AAAAAAAA!
Nathan's frustration
with Mimsy has caused a momentary lapse in judgement.

He has played the B flat himself, thus causing his plan to literally

backfire on him.
Nathan
[lands with a thud on the beach] Uuuh! [gets up and swoons. The black mamba snake comes up and bites him on the left arm] AAAH! [a group of Tardicaca Indians rides by and shoots arrows into him. He falls to the ground again. The Tardicaca shark comes up out of the water again and humps him, again.] No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!
The intervention room. Towelie, Butters, and the therapist are all crying as Washcloth just lays there at the edge of a sofa cushion.
Towelie
Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry.
Butters
He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. [resumes crying]
Jeff VanVonderen
You've got so many people that just love the heck out of ya, Towelie. [resumes crying]
Towelie
All right. All right, I'll go.
Butters
You will?
Towelie
I don't wanna hurt Washcloth anymore.
Jeff VanVonderen
He's goin', everybody. Hugs! [the other boys come in and hug Towelie]
Lake Tardicaca, day. The paramedics have been called in and are preparing Nathan for the trip to the hospital
"Elmer Fudd"
Ohh Wed Team. Your captain weawwy got waped.
"Pete Puma"
I've never seen a kid get screwed by a shark before. Heeee!
"Beaky Buzzard"
I hope I never see it again. Ahhahahaha.
Jimmy
Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ.
Nathan
I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being.
Mimsy
Dahhh you sure got it stuck it to you this year, boss.
Nathan
Shut up... Mimsssyyy. [the paramedics lift Nathan into the ambulance and take off]
Towelie is shown in flight
Towelie is going to Ocean View Terrace
Treatment Center in Rancho

Palos Verdes, California
Towelie is shown approaching the front doors to the treatment center with a small suitcase
Counselor
Hi, Towelie?
Towelie
Yeah, hi.
Counselor
[in his office] Towelie is definitely one of the most addicted towels we've ever seen here. He's probably the second most psychologically damaged towel I've come across since treating Kirstie Alley's towel, which, had seen some... uuff, some nasty stuff.
Towelie
[on a bench overlooking the ocean] I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.
Singer
Veins swell
You know me, Ellen
Enough to tell
Five steps, you're over

Towelie finished treatment and is back
living with his girlfriend Rebecca.

He has been sober since

April 26, 2010.

End of Crippled Summer

Poor and Stupid
South Park Elementary, day. School lets out for the day, but Cartman sits in front of his locker crying. Stan and Kyle come into view and walk towards him
Stan
Cartman, dude, what's wrong?
Cartman
[crying quietly] Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
Kyle
Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Something's going on.
Cartman
It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
Kyle
"What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up"?
Cartman
I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! [buries his head in his lap and cries some more]
Stan
Why not?
Cartman
Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
Stan
[faces Cartman] Cartman, tell us.
Cartman
[sniffs] No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! [cries some more]
Stan
Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
Cartman
[cynically, walks off a bit] Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver. [turns around and faces the boys] Look at me! [gestures to himself] Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? [turns away]
Kyle
Aww. Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
Cartman
No I can't; I'll always be like this. [wipes tears away]
Stan
Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
Cartman
Come on you guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! [cries some more]
Kyle
[reassessing his assumption] What?!
Cartman
I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
Stan
Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
Cartman
Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
Kenny
[looks up from his locker] (What?)
Cartman
You love NASCAR huh?
Kenny
[showing the posters inside his locker] (Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)
Cartman
You see I told you guys! [turns and walks to his locker] What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! [puts his arm on the locker and rests his head on his arm]
Kyle
Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
Cartman
[lifts his head up] I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. [goes back to crying]
Stan
Dude, you are so retarded!
Cartman
Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
Kyle
How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
Cartman
[stops crying and brightens up] You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. [smiles]
Kyle
I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
Cartman
Then maybe I can make myself believe it too. [getting confident] Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]
Butters' house, some time later. Cartman walks up to the front door and knocks. A smiling Butters walks up to the door and opens it
Cartman
Butters.
Butters
Hey Eric.
Cartman
Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up. [pumps both fists] I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and [pumps both fists] I'm psyched!
Butters
Ahhh well oh-[pumps his right fist] kay.
Cartman
But [points his right index finger at him] I'm gonna need your help. [points both index fingers at him] Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get [pumps both fists twice] psyched up??
Butters
Eeyeah, I'm psyched.
Cartman
Get really psyched up, Butters!
Butters
[starts pacing back and forth with energy] I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
Cartman
I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
Butters
NASCA- NASCAR?
Cartman
I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters, [reaches to his left and pulls into view a water jug full of small change] Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
Butters
You're givin' away all your money??
Cartman
[points] Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back. [lowers his finger] From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
Butters
You sure you want to do this?
Cartman
[points] I told you I'm serious, Butters. [lowers his finger] This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
The South Park Mall, evening. A NASCAR display is at the center of the mall, with car and a box of calendars, and a spokesman
Spokesman
Alright folks, we wanna thank you all for comin' out an' supporting NASCAR.
Kenny
[takes a 2011 calendar] (Yeah! How cool!)
Spokesman
Now who's ready for Saturday's big race? [the crowd cheers]
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Spokesman
We're really excited to be part of the fastest-growing sport in America! [the crowd cheers]
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Spokesman
I don't know about you, but I'm thrilled to watch NASCAR finally becoming recognized as a respected, legitimate sport. [the crowd cheers]
Kenny
(Yeah! Yeeaahh!)
Butters
[appears, hauling a cart] Hello! 'Scuse me! [the crowd quiets down and looks] I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all [shows off his haul] fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome! [turns around and skips away grinning] Heh! I helped the needy! [Kenny watches him leave]
Cartman's house, night, Cartman is on the sofa watching TV upside down. He strapped himself down so he doesn't slip off the sofa. His face is turning red from the blood pooling up under his skin
Man 1
[voice-over] Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats. [laughter] I just wish I had brought an umbrella.
Butters
Hey Eric.
Cartman
Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
Butters
Yep. You don't have a penny left. [points] You're poor as shit. [looks him over] How come you're hangin' upside down?
Cartman
I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
Charlie
Hey- that's a hot girl over there. [giggles]
Jake
Sure she's hot. She's wearing a sweater. [giggles. The studio audience giggles and applauds]
Butters
Feel stupid yet?
Cartman
Not yet.
Commercial - Vagisil
Woman 1
When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil-
Cartman
Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
Woman 1
To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors.
Cartman
Fucking gross!
Butters
All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
Woman 1
If you develop an allergic reaction, see your doctor. In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.
Woman 2
For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.
Cartman
[quickly rights himself and stands up] Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?! [clicks on the remote control to reverse it, then plays and echoes the commercial] "In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss." [clicks the remote to pause the playback] Oh my God, Butters... [makes a fist with his left hand] we need Vagisil!
A supermarket. Cartman and Butters are in the feminine hygiene section
Cartman
"Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."
Butters
Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.
Cartman
Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
Butters
Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
Cartman
I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
Butters
But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
Cartman
Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here. [positions him] Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me. [As Butters keeps a look out, Cartman opens a tube of Vagisil anti-itch cream and begins to swallow it. Then he takes a bottle of wash and chugs that down, following that up with two more tubes, then more products] Is anybody coming?
Butters
No, you're good. [behind them a woman and her daughter walk by and stop to look. Cartman chugs down another bottle of feminine wash]
Cartman
Mm, 'kay, Mm. [throws the bottle away] N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... [grabs a tube of maximum strength anti-itch cream]
Woman 3
Little boy, what are you doing? [Cartman looks over his shoulder, then turns around to look at her. Butters notices and does the same. A few seconds later, Cartman turns away]
Cartman
Oh my God! Butters! [taps Butters' shoulder and Butters turns around] I feel kind of stupid!
Butters
Really?
Cartman
Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
Butters
That was fast.
Cartman
Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
Race day at Colorado National Speedway. The NASCAR drivers are lined up in two columns awaiting the start of the race.
Announcer
We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300. [Dale Evans is shown in his car]
Butters
Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir? [Dale looks over to his left. Butters is in the pit stop] Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
Dale
What?
Butters
Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
Dale
Oh my God! [gets out of his car, throws down his helmet, and goes to the pit area]
Cartman
[walks towards the car] Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! [puts on the helmet and climbs into the car]
Butters
[now on the walkie-talkie] Eric, are you sure you can do this?
Cartman
[Swallows another tube of Vagisil] Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
Announcer
Let the race begin!
Cartman
Let's go NASCAR! [the other drivers zoom past him. He steers the wheel, but realizes] I'm not moving, Butters.
Butters
I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
Cartman
What's that?
Butters
There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
Cartman
Oh okay. [leans down to press it. He burns rubber and takes off, as "La Grange" by ZZ Top plays] Let's go NASCAR! [he immediately crashes into the wall and tries to power out of it. Suddenly, he turns left and goes back the other way]
Announcer
It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way!
Cartman
Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! [the other drivers round the corner and avoid him. Car #78 crashes through the wall and plows up the bleachers. Cartman tries to turn around but goes up into the air and into the pit area. Everyone there gets out of the way. He hits a low wall and goes up into the air again...]
Cartman
[abash] Oh, fuck my ass! [he lands in a lake by the Winners Circle.]
Butters
[on the walkie-talkie and mortified] Eric?
A hospital recovery room, night. Cartman is laid up in bed, and Butters is keeping him company. Cartman's right leg is in a cast and up in a sling
Cartman
All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
Butters
Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
Cartman
[looks away] Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
Butters
Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
Cartman
I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
Doctor
[enters the room] Alright Eric, we got the X-rays back.
Butters
How bad is it, doctor?
Doctor
He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a level 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean.
Butters
Well at least there's that.
Cartman
Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
Doctor
You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.
Cartman
Aw donkey balls...
Doctor
You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing! [walks away]
Cartman
Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
Doctor
[turns around] No, really. Of all the idiotic dumb ways I've seen kids injure themselves, yours takes the retard cake! [walks out of the room]
Butters
Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
Cartman
Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
Butters
It has to be, Eric. [Cartman moves his right leg out of the sling and gets out of bed.] Eric, where are you going?
Cartman
Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. [Butters brightens up]
Kenny's house, day. Kenny is reading a NASCAR magazine on the sofa
FOX 11 Anchor
You're watching Colorado FOX 11. Next on FOX 11 News, are NASCAR fans stupid? [Kenny looks up] Some people are starting to wonder after a NASCAR fan apparently got high on Vagisil and snuck onto the track, killing eleven people.
Reporter
Tom, the NASCAR fan got into a car here on Sunday and crashed in the lake behind me. He was later found to have ingested this [holds up a tube] Maximum Strength Vagisil. And also Vagisil medicated wipes. Making NASCAR fans look ...pretty stupid, Tom.
Kenny
[closes his magazine and throws it on the sofa in a blind rage] (No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)
Reporter
The NASCAR fan vows he will try to do it again, but that this time, he'll win.
Kenny
(Oh that fucking asshole!) [gets off the couch and walks out the front door, vexed] (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)
Cartman's house, day. A vile Kenny walks over to Cartman's house, goes up the steps, and pounds and kicks at the front door until Cartman answers it
Cartman
Oh hey, Kenny! [Kenny is not happy and his arms are crossed]
Kenny
(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)
Cartman
Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on. [Kenny follows him in. Cartman shows him all the stuff he purchased - a jet ski, a Room-bot, a 7.1 speaker system, a plasma TV, an LCD monitor, a VHS/DVD combo player] Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? [Kenny is still pissed off]
Kenny
(Dude, fuck you!)
Cartman
Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
Kenny
(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
Cartman
[annoyed] Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
Kenny
[apoplectic] (No you fucking don't!)
Cartman
Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I've had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
Kenny
[thinks for a moment] (What?!)
Cartman
I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do! [Kenny raises his fists up, but Cartman hugs him with one arm] Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
Man
[appears at the front door] Uh, excuse me. [Cartman sees him and walks to the door] Eric Cartman?
Cartman
Yeah?
Man
My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.
Cartman
...Uh oh.
Geoff Hamill
Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty. [steps aside to reveal Patty standing halfway out in the yard] She's my Muse, my flame. We realized that NASCAR can do a lot for product recognition and so, Vagisil has a little present... for you. [turns around and walks out, showing off a brand-new Vagisil NASCAR car]
Cartman
Awww, sweet! [runs to the car, then runs his right hand over the body] No way, this is so tits!
Geoff Hamill
Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.
Cartman
Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
Kenny
[angrily in disbelief] (No fucking way!)
Geoff Hamill
And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.
Cartman
Aww coool, huh Kenny? [Makes engine revving and shift change noises] I got a NASCAR, Kenny! [Geoff looks at Kenny, smiling] So awesome, huh Kenny? [Kenny can only look on angrily]
A conference room, day. A NASCAR spokesman holds a mic
Announcer
We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters.
Reporter 1
So uh what's your guys' take on the track here? Any concerns? [present are Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Jimmie Johnson, Danica Patrick, Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Eric Cartman, and Matt Kenseth]
Jimmie Johnson
Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-
Cartman
[doing a redneck accent and acting completely stupid] Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
Reporter 2
Uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow; any concerns about restrictor plate or brake fade problems?
Jeff Gordon
Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-
Cartman
Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
Dale Earnhardt, Jr.
Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?
Cartman
Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
Danica Patrick
Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?
Cartman
Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
After the press conference, Cartman meets up with Butters
Butters
You seemed really stupid, Eric.
Cartman
Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
Mick's Lanes. Kenny is at the bar drinking glass after glass of water, looking depressed. On TV, Pardon The Interruption airs
Tony Kornheiser
Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.
Cartman is in a studio of his making; a confederate flag hangs on the wall, a checkered flag with NASCAR next to it hangs above a propane grill (indoors) an unmade bed in the background. He himself looks like he's wasted on Vagisil. He clears his throat and begins recording
Cartman
Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'... [holds up a bottle] Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme. [squeezes some out and rubs it all over his lips] Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this "Obama" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline! [spits into a can] What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell! [Kenny buries his face in the counter, in shame. On screen, Butters appears behind Cartman] You all know my pit boss, Butters. [Butters appears over by the grill, also with a mouthful of Vagisil]
Butters
Obama's fuckin' gay.
Cartman
He's fuckin' gay as hell!
Butters
Pissin' me off!
Cartman
[dips again and rubs it on his lips] So y'all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
Tony Kornheiser
[back to kenny sitting watching TV at Mick's Lanes] Well if you ask me, that's all the proof we need that NASCAR really is just for the poor... [sharply] and the stupid.
Kenny
[Kenny has enough as he slammed his fist in anger] (Fuck this!) [leaves the bar, livid]
Saturday at Colorado National Speedway. The Vagisil car is prepared as Cartman sits in it
Commentator 1
The stage is set for what could be the most important race of the NASCAR year.
Commentator 2
Lots of speculation and interest in the Vagisil car, driven by Eric Cartman. We are joined now by the inventor and owner of Vagisil, Geoff Hamill.
Geoff
Thank you, Chris.
Chris
[Commentator 2] Geoff? Why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?
Geoff
Vagisil is very excited to be part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I... first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks.
Commentator 1
Ohkay, well the race is about to start, so why don't we kick it back down to the track?
Announcer
[Over the PA system] Gentlemen, start your engines! [the crowd begins to cheer]
Cartman
Alright, "start your engine." What's that mean?
Pit Crewman
That means you flip the switch that says "Engine." [to Butters] Is he stupid or what?
Butters
Yeah, he's a champion alright.
At the Speedway entrance, Kenny approaches the racetrack entrance with a tote bag
Security Guard
Check your bag please, sir? [Kenny hands him the bag. The guard checks the bag and pulls out a long rifle] No, no, see, this won't do. You can't bring a sniper rifle onto the track.
Kenny
(Aww, come on!)
Security Guard
Look, NASCAR is trying to change its image. It's people like you that are givin' NASCAR a bad name!
Kenny
(Aw come on, fuck you!) [enters]
Security Guard
You might be able to buy one in the gift shop. [inside, the cars begin to move down pit lane]
On the track
Announcer
[Over the PA] The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car.
Cartman
[in the redneck accent] Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward. [does so and rear-ends #78, then back up and swerves onto the track and sideswipes #95 and #78] NASCAR! Yee-ah!
Pit Crewman
This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!
Cartman
Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! [hits the brakes and #7 runs into him. Danica Patrick is the driver]
Danica Patrick
[infuriated] The fuck are you doing?!
Cartman
[gives her the middle finger] Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! [steps on the gas and peels away. Other cars pass Danica, whose engine is now on fire]
Danica Patrick
Oh, son of a bitch!
Cartman
Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!

And it looks like the Vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race.
Chris
Yea, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?
Geoff Hamill
Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day, [looks at Patty and enunciates] Every. Day. [she just stands there] Every. Day. [she looks down and away] ...And available nationwide.
On the track, the racers speeding on each other, Cartman side smashes the #52 car to a wall causing it to spin out
Butters
Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side. [Danica Patrick finally comes out of her car] You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
Cartman
Oh yeah, I see it. [Cartman avoids the car, but runs over Danica, who was trying to make it across the track to the field inside]
Danica Patrick
AAAAAA! [Cartman keeps going and ran over her]
Cartman
[looks over his right shoulder, then faces forward again] You see that? Daynicuh Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
Butters
That's fuckin' gay as hell.
Cartman
Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left. [turns the steering wheel hard to the left and drives through the drivers' eating area and the pedestrians all running and screaming, Cartman ran over most of them and some survived by running from the side] Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang! "[Cartman made it back on the track]"
Butters
There you go. You're back on the track.
Cartman
I'm back own the track. [An enraged Kenny makes his way down the bleacher steps towards the track. He jumps onto the track and lands on the Vagisil car. He turns around on the car roof and looks into the car through the windshield, Cartman also enraged as well] What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
Kenny
[pounds on the windshield] (Stop this car!)
Cartman
[irked] Get off my car, Kenny!
Kenny
[inflamed] (Stop this car right now!)
Butters
Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? [the #14 car is getting its wheels changed when Cartman barrels into it, causing it to flip over and land on its pit crew, killing them]
Cartman
We're tradin' paint! [further down the track he hits two other cars, which then slammed into each other. Back to Cartman, he's furious] Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
Kenny
[incensed] (I fucking hate you!)
Cartman
[determined and angered] Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brake! Bye Kenny. [steps on the brakes, launching Kenny at the end of the track]
Kenny
(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...) [goes a long distance before the first bounce, then bounces a few more times. Two other cars remain on the track, and they pass Cartman]
Driver
Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. [the two cars swerve just in time, but one crashes into the outer wall, the other into the inner wall, Kenny ducks]
in the booth
Chris
Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.
Geoff Hamill
This is such a great day for Vagisil, Chris. Our product awareness will be at an all-time high. Feminine odor must be treated diligently. [looks over at Patty] Very. Diligently. [a look of shock crosses his face. Patty is gone. The cameramen wonder what's going on.] Patty? Patty?
On the track, Patty walks over to the #48 car and pulls its driver out. She climbs in
Announcer
It looks like a woman is trying to take over for Jimmie Johnson's car. [Mr. Hamill and the commentators join him in his booth]
Geoff Hamill
What? [Patty gets the car started and backs up. Determined, she takes off as "La Grange" starts playing again]
Lowes Pit Boss
Ma'am? You are on an active racetrack. This is extremely dangerous.
Geoff Hamill
Let me talk to her. [puts on the pit boss's headphones] Patty? Patty, what are you doing? [Patty skillfully drives the car around the track] Patty, pull over the NASCAR. You're acting irrationally. Patty, did you forget to take your medication? You know how you get when you don't use your Vagisil. There should be some in your purse, my Muse. Patty? [she reaches Cartman and taps his car with Johnson's]
On the track, Patty hits Cartman from behind.
Cartman
Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck mah car.
Butters
I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
Cartman
Fuckin' gay as hell. [Patty pulls up to his left, taps him a bit, then pulls away.]
Geoff Hamill
Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame.
Announcer
They are neck and neck approaching the finish line. [This time she bumps him off. Cartman's car spins out then flips up in the air...]
Cartman
[Shocked] Oh, fuck my ass again! [...and crashes upside down into the outer wall. Patty goes onto the finish line, getting the victory for Jimmie Johnson]
Geoff Hamill
[Geoff is frustrated] HAAAAAAAAAA!
Moments later, at the winners' circle. Lots of cheers as Patty Hamill shows off the huge trophy, an angry Geoff walks to her
Announcer
Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team.
Geoff Hamill
Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil!
nearby, Cartman and Butters look on, Cartman's NASCAR racesuit is slightly has ash and his hair as well, while he brush himself off in defeat. Kenny walks up to Cartman and angrily points
Kenny
(HA! You fucking lose!) [crosses his arms in triumph]
Cartman
No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. [Kenny is confused] I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
Butters
[flabbergasted] Huh?
Cartman
[livid] The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
Butters
Uh, but- but you- you said I had to [begins to stammer, both walk off, as Kenny stares in confusion] s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- [unintelligible]
Cartman
Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
Butters
But you said to take your money so I took it by [unintelligible] Ah I don't know.
End of Poor and Stupid

It's a Jersey Thing
The Broflovski house, dining room table, evening. The family is gathered at table eating dinner
Kyle
Mom, Dad, what's "muff cabbage"? [Gerald and Sheila pause. They look at each other, then turn back to their son]
Gerald
[confused] Muff cabbage?
Sheila
[also confused] Where did you hear that?
Ike
Muff cabbage!
Kyle
The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop "muff cabbage".
Ike
Muff cabbage.
Sheila
A new family moved in? Where are they from?
Kyle
She said they're from New Jersey.
Sheila
[drops her fork] New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
Kyle
Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
Sheila
[fearful, quickly leaves her chair and walks off a bit] Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?
Kyle
Know what, Ma?
Ike
Muff cabbage!
Sheila
Never invite a New Jersey housewife into your home.
The Marsh house, dinner time. The table has been enlarged to accommodate their guests - a family with three kids. Grandpa Marsh is not at the table
Teresa
[at the head of the table. Sharon is to her right] And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!
Teresa's new home, next door, on New Jersey Housewives
Teresa
Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me.
The Marsh house, dinner time
Teresa
Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?
Sharon
Oh, Linda, huh?
Teresa
Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage! [the girls at the table just look on and continue eating] I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you got a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!
Joe
[as Teresa rattles on] So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?
Randy
I don't really work out.
Joe
Well, I gotta find somethin'. [flexes his left biceps] My biceps are goin' flat.
Teresa
Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?
Sharon
Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.
Teresa
Ears out to here! [spreads her arms out as far as they could go] So I tell her, "You got big ears, sweetie." I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? [to Sharon] I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections.
Sharon
Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. [Teresa's expression changes to a dark mood]
Teresa's new home, next door, on New Jersey Housewives
Teresa
That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No.
The Marsh house, dinner time
Teresa
You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution... [slams her hands on the table] ...whore! You probably sell your muff... [slams her hands on the table] ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you! [lifts the table, which causes it to dump the food on the floor. Sharon quickly hides behind Randy] You're nothin' but garbage! [Joe comes up and restrains her from behind] That's what you are! You're garbage! [Stan's eyes dart back and forth] You sick, old woman! Muff garbage! [Joe takes her into the kitchen] Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!
Sharon
Wow.
Teresa
Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off! [to Joe] Okay, I love you.
Joe
Take it easy.
Teresa
I love you. [they kiss] I love you.
Teresa's new home
Teresa
I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am. [she takes Joe's hand and walks him back into the dining room] Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine.
The Marsh house, dinner time
Teresa
Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Meeee!
At Sizzler, day. The boys are having lunch there
Stan
You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
Cartman
You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
Kyle
[glaring at him] Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
Cartman
Oops, busted. [avoids eye contact]
Stan
They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, "Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."
Jersey Man
Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey.
Cartman
Aw, crap, there's more of them?
Jersey Man
'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey? [a lot of people respond excitedly]
Highlight. The Jersey man is Steve "Last Call"
Steve "Last Call"
So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, "Who's from Jersey?", and people are all like, "Yo! Woo-hoo!" Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler. [the restaurant is transformed into a club]
Sizzler, later on. Everyone is dancing except the boys, music is pumping, lights flash all around
Woman
[nude in a in a Jacuzzi] Yeah, let's get this party started. [a random fight breaks out]
Kyle
Where the hell are they coming from?! [a bottle of Corona beer lands in front of the boys and shatters]
South Park Salon, day. Sharon approaches it. Inside...
Teresa
Danielle was being a stupid bitch.
Woman 1
Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!
Teresa
I'm pathetic? You're muff gabbage! [Sharon walks into the salon. Teresa gets up to greet her] Oh, Sharon! [they hug] Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey.
Jacqueline
And Sicilian.
Teresa
That's Danielle. She's from Jersey. [Danielle is extremely tanned] And that's Caroline.
Caroline
I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.
Salon Girl
I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down? [Teresa didn't like that request]
Highlight.
Jacqueline
When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit.
the salon
Teresa
Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!
Caroline
Teresa! Calm down.
Salon Girl
I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!
Teresa
Get her, Sharon!
Sharon
What?
Jacqueline
Sharon, just stay out of it!
Caroline
Be the bigger person, Sharon!
Sharon
You people are crazy.
Caroline
Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?! [grabs Sharon by the hair as she screams] Is my family crazy?!
Teresa
Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch! [pulls Sharon back by the hair]
Sheila
[barges in ready to fight] Let go of her, you piece of trash! [the other ladies turn to look]
Teresa
Who the fuck are you to tell ME what to do?!
Sheila
[walks up to the women] All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
Teresa
Psycho bitch!
Sheila
[slaps her hand away] No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho biiitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! [the Jersey women begin to leave]
Jacqueline
[turns to look at Sheila] You're cabbage! [then leaves]
Sharon
Sheila?
At the South Park Community Center, evening. Randy has the floor as the other townsfolk sit and listen
Randy
People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. [this includes Puerto Rica and Cuba]
Mr. Garrison
Jesus! Why are they doing this?
Randy
More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
Jimbo
Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!
All
Yeah!
Sheila
That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
Jimbo
How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski? [Sheila is on the spot.]
Highlight.
Sheila
That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey. [the adults present are Stephen and Linda Stotch, Randy and Sharon Marsh, Stuart McCormick, his wife, and Liane Cartman] Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang. [a picture of her is shown] I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face. [a picture of one such incident is shown] Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey. [turns away from the other adults] I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
Sharon
Sheila, who are you talking to?
Sheila
You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. [walks away]
The park, basketball court, day. The boys - Stan, Kenny and Cartman - are playing basketball. Kenny has the ball and is trying to get past Cartman
Cartman
You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
Kyle
[approaching] Hey, dudes.
Cartman
[takes the ball from Kenny and confronts Kyle] Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
Kyle
What are you talking about?
Cartman
Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
Kyle
So what?
Cartman
So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
Kyle
No, it doesn't!
Cartman
[turns around] He's from Jersey, you guys. [inches away] Let's just get away from him.
Kyle
I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
Cartman
Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
Kyle
What's strike three?!
Cartman
[takes off Kyle's hat] You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
Kyle
Shut the fuck up! [takes his hat back and puts it on, then looks at the other boys] What?
Stan
Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
Kyle
Why does it matter?!
Stan
No, uh, it just explains a lot.
Cartman
[moves Kyle aside] Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
Kyle
No, it isn't!
Cartman
Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
Stan
Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Cartman
Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you. [walks away, then turns and glares at him] And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
The Broflovski house, night. Kyle is brushing his teeth when he looks at himself in the mirror and then checks out his hands and his face. He takes his toothbrush out of his mouth and drops it into the sink, then checks out his hat
Kyle
No. [removes his hat] Couldn't be. [opens the top drawer of the vanity and pulls out a pair of scissors. He begins to cut his hair, slowly, then faster and faster. He gets some styling gel and rubs it into his hair. He gets a razor out to shape his eyebrows, cuts more of his hair off, rips the sleeves off his shirt, gets a bracelet and puts it on his right forearm, gets more gel and rubs a design onto his shirt, then is shocked at what he sees in the mirror] Oh, my God.
Sheila
[knocks on the bathroom door] Kyle? You in there?
Kyle
Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. [goes about putting stuff away and closing all the drawers]
Sheila
Kyle, open the door.
Kyle
Not now, Mom. Please.
Sheila
Kyle, this instant! One, two. [Kyle goes to the door]
Kyle
All right, all right. [opens the door and see his mom, who's really Jerseyfied herself. He's speechless]
Sheila
I guess we need to talk.
Kyle's bedroom, minutes later. She and Kyle are sitting on his bed
Sheila
I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
Kyle
[enunciating] What am I, Mom?
Sheila
When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
Kyle
[getting scared] What are you saying?!
Sheila
I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
Kyle
[looks at his new look] No! I don't wanna look like this!
Sheila
It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.
Ike
[walks by and looks] Aaaaiiiiihhhhh! [faints on his back]
Kyle
I can hide it! [hops off the bed] Nobody ever has to know! [puts his hat back on and walks out the bedroom door] I can't ever let anybody know!
a news program comes on
Announcer
Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the "Jersey News" with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!
P-Train
What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago.
Reporter
People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out. [the Giudice family is forcibly hauled out of their new home and stuffed into their car] And they're takin' down all the Jersey-owned shops! [South Park Salon is bombed and everyone in there runs out] It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?!
Tan Jovi
What's up with that?!
P-Train
What's up with that?!
Tan Jovi
Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!
South Park, night, town square. The townsfolk have brought everything they could think of to form a barricade against the Jersey folk. Randy is on the line
Randy
Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
Schwarzenegger
Ve are very sore-y, but Cal-i-for-ni-a cannot afford helping you at this time.
Randy
Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
Schwarzenegger
No, because U-tah is between Colo-rah-do and Cal-i-for-ni-a.
Randy
Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
Schwarzenegger
Nevada.
Randy
Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!
South Park, night, town square. In the shadows, Kyle gives Kenny a rifle as Cartman walks up. Stan gives another rifle to Kyle
Cartman
What the hell are you guys doing?!
Stan
Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
Cartman
[points to Kyle] And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy!
Kyle
I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
Cartman
Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
Kyle
That's enough!
Cartman
Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
Kyle
Aaaarrghhhhhh! [runs at Cartman and pins him hard against a tree] I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! [lets go and walks away angrily. Cartman backs up a bit without saying a word, then breaks down]
Cartman
[Whining] That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the treeee! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it! [Stan and Kenny walk away silently] Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?!
South Park, night, town square. Randy is on the line looking for other support
Randy
Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people! [waits for an answer] Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month! [throws his cell phone away and claps his hands free of it] That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!
Stuart
We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
Randy
There is no support! Every ally America ever had is... [thinks of something] Wait a minute. [strokes his chin] Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
Mr. Garrison
What are you talking about?
Randy
We could ask Al Qaeda.
Stephen
[steps forward] Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!
Randy
Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
Stephen
And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!
Bar Patron 1
Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bar quick! There's trouble!
Randy
People from Jersey?
Bar Patron 1
I don't know what the hell I saw.
Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. Officer Barbrady's cruiser is parked out front. Officer Barbrady and other men from the town search the bar in the darkness with flashlights
Skeeter
It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed the cigarette machine in half.
Barbrady
Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. [a soft, high growl is heard and a figure runs by in the shadows, bumping into a few tables. The figure runs by again, grunting. The flashlights follow the sound and find a woman who looks like a troll cowering in a corner. Her arms are really short, her ears are elfin, her skin is orange]
Bar Patron 2
It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too! [the thing moves closer to the ATM and smokes]
Randy
What is it?
Bar Patron 2
It's called a Snooki. It's very famous. [Snooki sips from her drink and eats straight out of a pickle jar]
Randy
That thing is famous? Why?
Bar Patron 2
I don't know!
Jimbo
Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! [aims his shotgun and fires at her. She drops the pickle jar and it shatters.]
Snooki
[walking away from the ATM] Snooo-ki.
Randy
Don't let it get away! Where is it?! [hears a sound] Who was that?! [his beam lands on Snooki, who has taken Stephen Stotch down and is raping him]
Stephen
Aaagh! Get it off of me!
Snooki
[raping him] Snooki smoosh.
Stephen
Shoot it! [another gunshot is heard and Snooki heads for a window and jumps out through it, running away]
South Park Square, night. Cartman has left his usual friends and is talking to a group of other boys from his class: Bradley, Jason, Butters, Fosse, DogPoo, and Bill
Cartman
So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, "I'll smash your teeth in!" My head is all like gashed open.
Butters
Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
Cartman
I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler. [Kyle is cleaning his rifle nearby and lifts his head to see what the other boys are doing] Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh? [Kyle returns to cleaning his rifle. Cartman then moves to the opposite side of the circle] He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
Butters
Are you being serious?
Cartman
This is very serious, Butters.
Butters
Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
Cartman
Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?! [Kyle looks up again. Cartman notices and turns to look back at him] Hey, Kyle. [stretches] Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh. [turns around and goes into a low voice as Kyle watches from nearby] We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
Al Qaeda headquarters in the caves of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda members go about their business
Operative
[walks up to bin Laden with a package] Istagia makuman? [bin Laden turns around and takes the package, which is a video tape. He puts it into a tape player and watches the video. Randy pops up onscreen]
Randy
Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. [Jersey Shore's live-action show open begins to play]
Snooki
Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
Sizzler, night time. Cartman climbs into the restaurant through a window
Cartman
Come on, you guys, hurry!
Stan
[climbs in behind him] Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
Cartman
I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
Kenny
[climbs in behind Stan] (What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) [Kyle climbs in last]
Cartman
[leads them to a spot] Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool. [stops] It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
Kyle
[looks at Cartman for a few seconds] Why?
Cartman
Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
Kyle
You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
Cartman
Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
Kyle
I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
Cartman
Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights! [the lights go on and the fourth graders Cartman was talking to earlier pop into view] Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! [the group of six come up and take Kyle away]
Stan
Dude, what are you doing?
Cartman
[stops Stan and Kenny in their tracks] Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. [rushes up to the freezer door] Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
Kyle
All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll... [his expression changes quickly] Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
Cartman
Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
Kyle
No, I- I'm serious. What is that behind you?
Cartman
You ginger Jersey Jew! [Snooki rises up behind him] Your tactics don't work on me!
Snooki
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
Cartman
[looks over his shoulder, then looks back at the other boys] Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
South Park Square, night. Stephen runs up to Garrison behind the barricade
Stephen
Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?
Mr. Garrison
He's still questioning that new prisoner.
nearby, Randy has a Jersey man strapped onto a chair
Randy
Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
The Situation
Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him hard on the left cheek]
Randy
What does that mean?!
The Situation
You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him again, kicks him with the left foot, punches him with the left hand, kicks him on the side of his head with the right foot]
Randy
Stop playing stupid!
Jimbo
Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.
Randy
[shoots back at Jimbo] Nobody's this stupid! [turns to The Situation again] What are you people planning?!
The Situation
It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it. [Randy punches him again with the left hand, kicks him with the left foot, delivers a roundhouse kick with the right foot, flips over him and kicks him on the back of the head]
Gerald
[keeping a lookout atop the barricade] Here they come! [the adults get into position]
Sharon
Is it them, Randy?
Randy
Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
Jersey People
Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!
Jersey Man 2
Let's go creepin' in this town!
Jersey Woman
[to another woman] Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!
Randy
This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! [some people cheer]
Randy
Fuck New Jersey! [some people cheer and begin firing. The advancing Jersey folk begin to fall one by one] Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
Sizzler, night. Screams of children are now heard. Snooki is now raping DogPoo
DogPoo
[Screaming] Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
Snooki
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
Stan
[tries to get out, but finds the doors locked] Try to find a way past it!
Cartman
What does it want?!
Butters
Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.
Snooki
[leaves DogPoo, reaches Cartman, and starts raping him from behind] Smoosh smoosh. Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
Cartman
No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
Stan
Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
Kyle
Oh, God. [gets a grabs his head and stumbles away, then falls on all fours] Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
Stan
[flatly] Why? [Kyle continues writhing and throws his hat away]
Kyle
Agggh! Agggh! [pulls out a tube of gel and puts some on his left hand] No! [quickly greases up his hair, takes off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves, puts on a necklace, combs his hair, puts on rings on his left hand, and writes "KYLeY-B" on his T-shirt]
Stan
Dude.
Kyle
[approaches Snooki; in Jersey accent] Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
Snooki
Snooki just, uh, smoosh in the... the tenth...
Kyle
You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage! [Snooki babbles and says her name] You've got cabbage in your muff! [Snooki continues babbling] You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! [Snooki continues babbling and Kyle finally fells her with a left hook. Snooki cries and escapes through a window. Cartman sobs a bit and puts his pants up]
Cartman
[Sniffling] Thank you, Kyle.
Back at the barricade, Jimbo searches for more ammunition
Jimbo
That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
Randy
Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
Stuart
What's the point? Can't you see it's over? [the sound of roaring jets is heard and grows louder]
Jimbo
Who is that?! [thirteen planes appear over the horizon]
Randy
It's Al Qaeda! [cheers go up from the crowd. An Al Qaeda pilot salutes from his cockpit. Soon they're diving their planes into the Jersey crowd and killing the Jersey folk] Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! [More cheers go up from the crowd]
Park County Community Center, day
Randy
On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, "Go away!" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. [bin Laden is shown seated on a chair. Cheers go up and Randy places a garland on him, and kisses him on the cheek]
Stan
Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
Kyle
Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
Cartman
Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster. [Pinches Kyle's cheek] But you're my little monster.
Stan
I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling "Muff cabbage," what's muff cabbage?
Kyle
It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
Randy
On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. [a paratrooper descends from the rafters and quickly kills bin Laden with one shot]
Paratrooper
[to his pilot] Tango is down, tango is down.
Randy
We got him!
End of It's a Jersey Thing

Insheeption
South Park Elementary, day. The students are all in the cafeteria eating lunch. In the middle of the cafeteria is a table with the four boys there. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit opposite Clyde, Craig, Kevin, and Token.
Cartman
So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. [laughs heartily. Butters approaches the table with a sheet of paper]
Butters
Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
Stan
A note?
Butters
Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this. [hands him the note] I'm like a mailman. [walks away. Stan reads and Kyle notices]
Kyle
What's it say?
Stan
[omitting the names] We need to talk.
Cartman
[voice rising in pitch] Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says "We need to talk" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
Two tables over, nine girls are eating lunch. Kal, Red, Wendy, Bebe, and Heidi sit opposite Esther, Anne, Lola, and Millie
Red
Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?
Wendy
Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called "hoarding." People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.
Stan
[approaching] Is something wrong, Wendy? [Wendy sees him, then looks at the girls, gets up and walks up to Stan]
Wendy
[sighs] Stan? We need to talk about your locker.
Stan
My locker?
Wendy
[turns away] Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.
Stan
Are you serious?
Wendy
[turns back] It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.
Stan
Well it's just a little messy.
Wendy
No, Stan, it's called "hoarding"! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!
Stan
Aw come on.
Wendy
Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
Stan
Yeah, alright.
Wendy
[wipes a tear from her eye] Okay. [puts a hand on his shoulder] I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.
South Park Elementary, hallway. Two men stand by Stan and his locker as the fourth graders look on. One of them holds a large trash bag and is wearing a face mask
An Expert
Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan. [Stan goes to his locker, opens it, and a few items fall out. The class gasps in horror: Stan's locker is truly packed. Wendy cries and hides her face with her notebook]
Stan
What, come on, it's not that bad.
Dr. Chinstrap
Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.
Stan
My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
Dr. Chinstrap
[walks up to Stan and gets down on one knee] Okay, great. How about we start with this? [takes a small box out of the locker]
Stan
Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
Dr. Chinstrap
[defers right away, putting a hand up] Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this? [takes out a bent toothbrush] Broken toothbrush.
Stan
Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
Dr. Chinstrap
But it's broken.
Stan
Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
Dr. Chinstrap
[defers right away] Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box. [sets it down] Now how about this? [pulls out a clear sandwich bag with rotten food in it] Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots.
Class
Eeeeewwww! [two more men stand behind the class holding trash bags and wearing face masks]
Stan
Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
Dr. Chinstrap
It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?
Stan
Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
Dr. Chinstrap
The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?
Stan
Well, I- I guess so, but- [Dr. Chinstrap dumps the baggie into the large trash bag his assistant is holding. The assistant is wearing a facemask] Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny look at each other worriedly]
Dr. Chinstrap
Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?
Stan
Well no, don't throw that out.
Dr. Chinstrap
Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then? [sweeps out a bunch of loose papers. Stan gets alarmed]
Stan
[begins gathering up the papers] No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-! [takes the bottle from Dr. Chinstrap. The assistant pulls out the baggie] G-give me back my sandwich! [Stan grabs the baggie, then reaches for another loose sheet, when he realizes what he's done. Cartman makes a circle around his right ear with his index finger and whistles a cuckoo tune]
Kyle
[walks up to Stan and puts a hand on his left shoulder] Dude. What's wrong with you?
Stan
I don't... I don't know.
Kyle
Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
Mr. Mackey's office, later. Stan is in his office
Mr. Mackey
Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter? [before Stan answers, he looks around the office. Mr. Mackey has a lot of junk in there]
Stan
Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... "hoarding."
Mr. Mackey
Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?
Stan
Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
Mr. Mackey
Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?
Stan
[looks around again] Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
Mr. Mackey
Me? ...Like, like what?
Stan
[looks around and picks up an empty milk carton from a box] Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
Mr. Mackey
DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!
South Park Elementary faculty room. Randy and Sharon are there with Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria, Dr. Chinstrap, and another expert
Dr. Chinstrap
There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3.
Principal Victoria
But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?
Sharon
Yes, our son has always been fairly clean.
Dr. Chinstrap
We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them.
Sharon
Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.
Dr. Chinstrap
I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is. [turns away] It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.
Randy
Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
Dr. Chinstrap
Oh no, really?
A pasture, day. Dr. Chinstrap and his partner are present with Sgt. Yates and an officer
Sgt. Yates
Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.
Mr. Yelman
[a shepherd, or sheep herder, or sheep hoarder] ...Well I, that is I, I-
Dr. Chinstrap
It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness. [Mr. Yelman doesn't know what they're talking about]
A lab, later. Stan, Mr. Mackey, and Mr. Yelman are all on couches with electrodes attached to their temples. Dr. Chinstrap is running tests as his partner and Stan's parents watch from an observation room
Partner
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful.
Dr. Chinstrap
Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding, or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.
Mr. Yelman
Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder.
Dr. Chinstrap
It's pronounced "hoarder," and yes you are.
Mr. Yelman
But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep.
Dr. Chinstrap
Yes, you are hurting sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that.
Mr. Yelman
No, but I just thought that-
Dr. Chinstrap
Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uh-kay?
Dr. Chinstrap
Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. float- [jumps out of his chair suddenly, startling the subjects] WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!
Mr. Mackey
What?! What?! Jesus, what?!
Mr. Yelman
Oh my God!
Dr. Chinstrap
Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second. [clears his throat] Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... now the cloud is near you, you... you reach out to it.
Mr. Mackey
[stretches his arm out] Mmm-kay...
Dr. Chinstrap
It's the cloud of your memories, of your past, [focus on Mr. Mackey] ...your childhood perhaps, ...what do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?
Mr. Mackey
Billy, ...Billy Thompson?
Mackey's memory takes him back to the 1970s, when he was in grammar school. Three kids angrily walk towards him in the hall.
Billy
There he is! Hey, Mackey! [Mr. Mackey, talking to two other boys, suddenly drops his books and turns around]
Mackey
Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay?
Billy
Come 'ere! [points to the spot where he wants Mackey. Mackey's friends panic and split]
Mackey
Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh...
Billy
You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.
Mackey
Oh well uh, uh... smoking's bad, uhkay? [Billy throws him up against a locker] Huhhhhh!
Billy
You're gonna die Mackey! [to his friends] Hold his legs! [his friends move in, but Mackey gets loose and runs away, screaming. Mackey rounds a corner, finds a room, and goes in before Billy could catch him. Billy and his friends round the corner and run past the room Mackey entered] Come back here!
Mackey
[in the darkness, starts to calm down] Okay. Okay, okay okay, it's okay. It's okay. Calm down, okay. Turn on the light. [turns on the light, revealing Stan]
Stan
What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
Mackey
Shh. Be quiet.
Mr. Yelman
'Scuse me, where are we?
Mackey
Shh. You've gotta be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there.
Stan
What the hell's going on?!
In the observation room Dr. Chinstrap and his partner analyze some printouts
Dr. Chinstrap
What the hell is going on?!
Partner
The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's.
Dr. Chinstrap
Oh Jesus.
Randy
What does that mean?
Dr. Chinstrap
It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.
Randy
What?!
Partner
I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.
Randy
Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
Dr. Chinstrap
It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background.
Pinkerton
Alright. [walks up to Randy and Sharon] Look, it is possible to enter into someone else's dreams. [Dr. Chinstrap begins a musical accompaniment] Send dream trackers to go into a person's subconscious, like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them. Perhaps even planting ideas. If one person is regressing deeply enough, the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person I talked about who's dreaming! And then, everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back. [Dr. Chinstrap ends his accompaniment at the same time]
Mackey's dream. Mackey runs into his bedroom, which is strewn with toys popular in the '70s.
Mackey
Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?
Stan
Mr. Mackey.
Mackey
[sees his Lite Brite, runs to work on it, and sings] Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m'kay.
Stan
Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?
Mackey
Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay.
Stan
Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!
Mackey
Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll! [goes to his dresser and grabs it] I can take the motorcycle, hm'kay, I put it on this thing, like this. [puts the motorcycle on the little ramp] Okay now crank it back, and now I let go. [releases the motorcycle, which zooms across the room and does a wheelie. Mackey giggles with excitement] Okay. Okay.
Stan
Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
Mackey
Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!
Mr. Yelman
Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep.
Stan
I'm working on it!
Mackey
[Singing along with the TV] Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass. Oooh two ooone three fouuur, m'kay!
Stan
[walks up to Mackey and turns him around] Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! [something hits Mackey's window and he goes to see what it was. He sees Billy on the sidewalk with his friends]
Billy
You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is the field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!
Mackey
No, uh Billy, please, uh-kay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh.
Billy
See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man! [walks away with his friends]
Mackey
[turns away from the window] Oh Jesus...
Stan
Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
Mackey
Yeah, it's probably gonna be bad, m'kay. [looks away]
The lab. The patients continue dreaming and moaning
Stan
Oh-Ohhhhhhh.
Mr. Mackey
Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.
The observation room
Randy
What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!
Dr. Chinstrap
Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.
Randy
That does it! [goes into the lab]
Dr. Chinstrap
What are you doing?!
Randy
I'm goin' in! [pulls up a couch next to Stan's] If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!
Dr. Chinstrap
Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!
Randy
Damn your incongruities! [hooks himself up] I'm goin' in after my son!
Dr. Chinstrap
It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!
Randy
I said get me in there!
Dr. Chinstrap
Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine! [snaps into a soothing rush job] You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it.
Randy
Ahhh.
Next day, the field trip
Bus Driver
Alright kids, everyone on the bus.
Stan
Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
Mackey
It's the day of the big field trip.
Billy
[from the bus window] Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya.
Mackey
Oh Jesus.
Stan
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
Bus Driver
Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!
Mr. Yelman
Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder.
Driver
It's pronounced "hoarder," young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! [shoves him into the bus]
Mr. Yelman
Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um.
Stan
Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
Randy
Stan? [Stan looks around] Stan!
Stan
Dad? Is that you?
Randy
Yes, it's me, Stan.
Stan
Where are you?
Randy
It's me! Up here! [Stan looks up and sees him] I'm a butterfly!
Stan
The hell are you doing, dad?
Randy
I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
Stan
Did you come here to help me?
Randy
I was gonna, but ooh! This is fun!
Stan
Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
Randy
Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
Stan
DAD!
in the lab, Randy is smiling
Randy
[moaning happily] Aah ahhh aha ahhh.
Stan
[moaning in frustration] Aaaaaagh!
The observation room. Pinkerton checks the printouts
Pinkerton
Uh oh, something's wrong.
Dr. Chinstrap
What is it?!
Pinkerton
The father. He's gone completely off chart.
Sharon
Off chart? What does that mean?
Pinkerton
We don't even know.
Dr. Chinstrap
I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.
Sharon
Who are the experts? [five men shooting guns enter the observation room, and one of them goes down with a gunshot wound]
Leonardo DiCaprio
Get that door closed! Keep me covered! [the expert in striped shirt shuts the door]
Dr. Chinstrap
Ah good, you're here.
DiCaprio
What's the sitch?!
Dr. Chinstrap
Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream.
Expert 1
We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!
Sharon
What next dream level?
DiCaprio
Alright look. Right now they're all trapped in a dream. [Dr. Chinstrap resumes the accompaniment] We need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream.
Sharon
Why?
Expert 1
[Black Suit (Arthur)] Because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo.
Sharon
What's that?
Expert 2
[in striped shirt (Eames)] Empty scary dreamspace.
Sharon
So like a nightmare?
Expert 3
[African-American (Yusef)] No, like a nightmare within a nightmare!
Sharon
Why can't you wake up from that?
Expert 1
You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare!
Sharon
That doesn't sound very difficult.
Expert 1
It is!
Sharon
Why?
Expert 4
Arrgh.
Expert 1
We don't have time for this!
Sharon
Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?
Expert 1
Then we go into your husband's dreams!
Sharon
Okaaay...
DiCaprio
But your husband will think we're in Hasselback's dream.
Sharon
Okay, wait. Who's Hasselback?
Hasselback
I am.
Sharon
Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?
DiCaprio
Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains!
Sharon
Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?
DiCaprio
Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time.
Expert 1
It's so complex and cool.
Sharon
Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!
DiCaprio
You just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough. Let's move! [the five experts and Hasselback enter the lab and hook themselves up]
Sharon
Will they be able to wake Mackey up?
Dr. Chinstrap
If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it.
Sharon
Why?
Dr. Chinstrap
Because.
Frisco Woods, day. The class has arrived at its destination
Ranger Pete
Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete.
Class
Hi Ranger Pete.
Mackey
Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay.
Ranger Pete
Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem.
Mackey
Oh that should be fun, m'kay. [looks at Billy, who looks back and punches his right palm with his left fist. His voice trembles] Ahhhh...
Ranger Pete
But first we have a very special guest. It's Woodsy Owl. [Woodsy !Owl skips into view]
Mackey
Oh boy! Woodsy Owl!
Stan
Who's that?
Mackey
"Give a hoot, don't pollute," m'kay.
Woodsy Owl
Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,
Mackey
Help keep Americaaa lookin' good, m'kay. [claps] Oh, boy I love that song.
Ranger Pete
Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six.
Billy
We wanna be in Mackey's group!
Mackey
Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh.
Ranger Pete
That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in.
Mackey
Oh no, oh God here it comes, unkay? [Stan looks at the ranger, then hears gunfire, so he turns to see where it's from. The group of experts is seen chasing and shooting at Butterfly Randy]
DiCaprio
Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream?
Expert 2
I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream!
DiCaprio
Oh well. Just keep shooting!
Stan
What the fuck?
The lab. All the patients moan and ahhh
An Expert
Mommy? Mommy?
The observation room. Pinkerton, Dr. Chinstrap, and Sharon are now accompanied by several firefighters, and they all observe the patients
Fire Captain
[turns to Dr. Chinstrap] So you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream?
Dr. Chinstrap
Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn.
Fireman 1
But, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we?
Pinkerton
It's very simple: You see, [Dr. Chinstrap provides accompaniment once again] when the dream experts go in, they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream.
Fireman 1
Like a taco within a taco?
Fire Captain
A double-decker taco supreme.
Pinkerton
Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams.
Fire Captain
Wait wait whoa whoa, how can you take a ladder into a dream? [Dr. Chinstrap continues his accompaniment, this time pulling a lamb by its tail and including its bleat]
Pinkerton
Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream.
Pizza Man
Somebody order a pizza?
Pinkerton
No.
Dr. Chinstrap
Probably one of them in the dream.
Pizza Man
[determined] Alright, I'm goin' in. [goes into the lab. He goes to the first expert's couch, lays down next to him, and hooks himself up]
Pinkerton
Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious.
Dr. Chinstrap
And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN! [provides his own accompaniment]
Frisco Woods, a pleasant scene. A butterfly sits on a leaf doing nothing when Randy descends on it and starts humping it. Soon, Mackey runs by and both butterflies fly away separately. Stan and Mr. Yelman chase Mackey
Mackey
Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah!
Stan
Mr. Mackey, stop running!
Mackey
But, but they're gonna kick my butt, m'kay! [stops briefly, then runs again] They're gonna kick it bad!
Stan
Look, dude! [catches up to Mackey and stops him] Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
Mackey
I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay.
Billy
There he is! You can't run forever!
Mackey
Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god... [Mr. Yelman catches up]
Stan
Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
Mr. Yelman
But I literally herd sheep.
Stan
Shut up!
Mackey
Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay?
The lab. The firemen have hooked themselves up and entered Mr. Mackey's dream.
Pizza Man
Somebody... order pizza? Pizza?
Pinkerton
Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic.
Dr. Chinstrap
Alright, that does it. [goes to the coat hanger and grabs his coat] Get your coat.
Pinkerton
Where are we going?
Dr. Chinstrap
We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.
Pinkerton
You don't mean...
Deep in the woods, day. A small cabin is seen in the distance as three helicopters fly towards it. A familiar bogeyman is shown splitting wood with an axe.
Dr. Chinstrap
Hello, Freddy. [the bogeyman turns around and it's Freddy Krueger, now with a full beard and mustache] You're looking healthy.
Freddy Krueger
Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work?
Dr. Chinstrap
Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream.
Freddy Krueger
Told you a long time ago: I gave that up. [resumes splitting wood]
Dr. Chinstrap
There's some good men stuck in there.
Freddy Krueger
[stops and turns around, exasperated] I said I'm done with it! [the cabin door and a woman with two kids appears in the doorway]
Woman
Everything all right, Fred?
Freddy Krueger
It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house. [Peg tugs at her kids and they all go back inside]
Dr. Chinstrap
Wife and kids.
Freddy Krueger
No thanks to you.
Dr. Chinstrap
We need ya Fred.
Freddy Krueger
Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?!
Dr. Chinstrap
We had a country to protect!
Freddy Krueger
Protect it yourselves this time.
Dr. Chinstrap
Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!
Freddy Krueger
Then you should have no problem covering it up. [resumes splitting wood]
Dr. Chinstrap
[a few seconds later] Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this.
Freddy Krueger
[stops, sighs, and throws his axe away] Alright, fine.
Frisco Woods, day. Mackey and Billy finally face off and Mackey is ready to fight
Mackey
Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself!
Billy
You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so! [Stan and Mr. Yelman look on]
Stan
You can do it Mr. Mackey.
Mackey
Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay?
Billy
Alright Mackey. Take this. [rears his right arm back and is about to deliver a punch when a gunshot kills him. A second gunshot hits him for good measure. The five experts converge on Billy and his friends and shoot them thoroughly]
DiCaprio
Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead!
Stan
What the hell?
Expert 2
We got 'em! The bad memories are dead.
Fire Captain
[through his bullhorn] Alright everyone, this is the fire department. Do not panic.
Stan
Who are you people?
DiCaprio
We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream.
Stan
Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
Expert 1
No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up.
Expert 2
Right. [nothing happens]
Stan
...So then why aren't we waking up?
Expert 2
Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.
Mackey
Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them.
Expert 2
[strokes the back of his neck with his left hand] Oh, whoops.
Mackey
[begins to walk away] I remember. [walks to a small shack nearby] I ran and I ran and I hid in this building here. And somebody was in there. Somebody who talked to me real nice and then... and then touched me somewhere bad. [pushes the door open. Woodsy is molesting the actual boy Mackey]
Real Mackey
No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay?
Mackey
Woodsy Owl! No! I'll never litter again! I'll keep all my trash! No please Woodsy no! [the woods begin to rumble and shake]
Fire Captain
What's happening?
Expert 2
Dream conundrum. This is bad. [Woodsy breaks through the front wall of the shack with glowing red eyes and roars]
Fire Captain
What the hell's going on?
DiCaprio
The bad memory is manifesting itself! It didn't wanna be exposed! [Woodsy runs towards the group. The experts begin shooting at it and advance, but Woodsy remains unharmed] Our dream bullets don't hurt it. [Woodsy reaches for Mr. Yelman and decapitates him with a swipe of his left wing]
Mackey
No! No more, Woodsy. [hides his face]
Stan
Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
Expert 1
He can't! Don't you get it?! We're all gonna go to limbo! [Woodsy roars again, and Freddy's blades rip through Woody's back and chest]
Freddy Krueger
There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy! [pulls his blades out and Woodsy falls down dead]
Mackey
It's dead... It's finally dead. [grins]
The observation room. Dr. Chinstrap reads the printouts this time
Dr. Chinstrap
Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.
Pinkerton
They're waking up. They're coming to. [enters the lab, and Dr. Chinstrap follows]
The lab. Everyone is finally out of Mackey's dream
Dr. Chinstrap
Ahhh, you're back, everyone! [grins]
Randy
Aw, dammit. [Sharon is just happy Stan is back as they grin at each other]
Fire Captain
Thanks, Freddy.
Freddy Krueger
If only I could have saved the sheep herder.
Dr. Chinstrap
Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problems, Mr. Mackey?
Mr. Mackey
I sure did.
DiCaprio
Turns out he was molested by Woodsy Owl.
Mr. Mackey
I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?
Fire Captain
So, he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember Woodsy's voice saying "Give a hoot, don't pollute" and touching his penis with his wing?
Pinkerton
Wow, that is so complex and trippy and cool!
Dr. Chinstrap
Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?
Stan
[thinks a moment] I think I have a better idea.
South Park Elementary, day. Stan is cleaning out his locker. Kyle and Wendy walk up to him
Wendy
Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?
Stan
Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
Kyle
But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
Stan
Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
Kyle
How do you know... [this stops Stan cold] that wasn't your therapy? [Dr. Chinstrap walks up and begins his accompaniment...]
End of Insheeption

Coon 2: Hindsight
Cartman's basement/The Coon's headquarters, day. A tapestry there now says "COON aND FRiEndS." The camera pans down to show The Coon with seven new superhero friends
Coon
My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening. [begins pacing back and forth] I don't know why, but we're seeing a huge trend in crime. We have to find out the source of this evil. Something big is about to happen, and it is up to Coon and Friends to stop it. [Stan raises his hand] Yes, Toolshed.
Toolshed
Why do we have to be called "Coon and Friends"?
Coon
[stops] ...What?
Toolshed
We all fight crime together. How come we're just your "friends"?
TupperWear
[steps forward] Yeah. We wanna be called "The Extreme Avenger League."
All
Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League!
Coon
I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work.
TupperWear
Why not?
Coon
It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.
Mosquito
Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?
Coon
Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!
Mosquito
Have, so.
Coon
[paces again] Look guys, we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city. [stops] Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden.
Iron Maiden
Timmeh!
Coon
Let's work, people! [the other heroes begin to leave, but Coon holds one back] Uh, Mint-Berry Crunch, could I have a quick word with you in the debriefing chamber? [takes Mint-Berry Crunch to a corner of headquarters, sits behind a desk and sighs] Okay, ummm, I really enjoy having you be a part of Coon and Friends and I certainly appreciate your on-time paying of dues and fees; it's just... I don't... I'm not getting your deal. I mean, exactly what is Mint-Berry Crunch supposed to mean? [Mint-Berry Crunch's jaw drops] I, I get that you're half man and half berry, and that you're... crunchy with some mint, but... to be a part of Coon and Friends, you have to have a clear and more... superhero kind of identity. [Mint-Berry Crunch just looks at himself, then back at Coon] Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume.
Mint-Berry Crunch
[looks at himself again] Like milk?
Coon
[annoyed] No, not like milk! You see, I really think we're on different pages here, Mint-Berry Crunch! It's like you don't even- [an alarm sounds]
Alarm
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.
Coon
Uh oh! [quickly leaves his chair. The superheroes meet up again in front of a big monitor, which is receiving video in Coon-O-Vision.] What's the alert, Mosquito?
Mosquito
There's like a big fire or something in town.
Coon
What? A fire? Coon volume up! [grabs the remote and clicks the up arrow for volume]
News 4 Reporter
There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck.
Coon
My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!
Coon's Friends
Let's do it! Yeah! Let's go! [they begin to head out, but Cartman stops Mint-Berry Crunch again]
Coon
Yeah, uhh, Mint-Berry Crunch, why don't you stay here and mind the place, okay? Kewl. [Mint-Berry Crunch stays behind as the others leave]
Cartman's house, moments later. The boys come out of the basement
Coon
We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends! [walks up to Liane, who's sitting on the sofa reading a book, and stops] Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!
Liane
Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?
Coon
Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now!
Liane
Well, all right. [puts down her book and blanket] I guess I can get some groceries anyway. [rises and leads the boys out to the car]
Liane's car
Coon
Into the Coon Mobile, everyone! Let's just hope we get there in time! [everyone gets in]
Liane
All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?
Coon
Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!
Liane
[bangs the center armrest with her right fist] Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!
Coon
[exasperated] Oh... I'm sorry Mom, can we go please? [Liane starts the car, and under his breath Coon says] Unbelievable! [crosses his arms]
Downtown. Fire trucks are everywhere and a few hoses fight the fire. Police are also present
Fireman
We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good!
Fire Captain
Those people are gonna die if we don't do something!
Liane
[pulls up] Oh my goodness, it's a fire. [the boys leave the car]
Coon
Come on, Coon Friends!
Liane
No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!
Fire Captain
Can we try a helicopter?
Fireman
The winds are too high. The chopper would burn in minutes. [Coon and Friends walk up next to the firemen]
Coon
All right, what seems to be the problem?
Fire Captain
Get back, kids. It isn't safe.
Liane
[walks around looking for Cartman] Eric, poopsie?
Coon
Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!
Mosquito
And friends!
Fire Captain
Keep those children back, Thompson! [Liane finds the boys and walks up to them]
Coon
Please sir, you must let us-
Liane
Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.
Coon
Shut! Up! Mom! God!
Officer
Wait. Look! Up in the sky!
Fireman
It's him! My God, it's really him!
Fire Captain
He's come to help us. Captain Hindsight! [in the distance a superhero flies towards the town. He's wearing red and yellow tights and a black cope with a blue eye on it - looking behind]
Stan
Who's Captain Hindsight?
Announcer
Captain Hindsight, the hero of the modern age. [a series of comic book pictures follows] Once known as Jack Brolin, a reporter for the national news, the hero was born when a freak accident gave him the amazing power of extraordinary hindsight. From toxic spills to unjust wars there is no task too large for... Captain Hindsight! [the hero descends and lands next to the firemen]
Fire Captain
Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come!
Captain Hindsight
What's the skinny?
Fireman
There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them.
Captain Hindsight
Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it.
Fireman
Yes, of course.
Captain Hindsight
And then you see that building to the left?
Fire Captain
Yes.
Captain Hindsight
They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to. [stands up tall] Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone! [takes off]
Fireman
Thank you, Captain Hindsight!
Officer
Thank youuu!
Fire Captain
All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up. [the firemen and officers quickly pack up and leave, but the building keeps burning. Coon and Friends can only watch helplessly as trapped residents scream.]
The Marsh house, dinner time. The family is eating quietly
Randy
Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
Sharon
Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.
Randy
It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
Sharon
Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.
Randy
I mean, hello!
Stan
Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
Randy
Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. [an alarm sounds]
Alarm
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. [they look around for the source of the alarm, then get up and enter the living room]
Randy
What the hell is that? [they stop in front of the alarm] Who put that there?
Alarm: Alert
Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously.
Stan
[backs up towards the stairs] Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
Sharon
[distracted] Well sure, Stan. [Stan goes upstairs] Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?
Randy
I don't know.
Sharon
Well take it down. It's noisy.
Randy
I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. [the alarm stays on as they look at each other in wonder.]
The Coon's headquarters, day. Toolshed enters the basement, revving his drill
Coon
Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start.
Toolshed
Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?
Mosquito
Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it.
Coon
The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.
TupperWear
So what's the huge catastrophe?
Coon
What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?!
The Human Kite
Yeah, so?
Coon
So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!
Toolshed
Oh Jesus...
Coon
[walks up to a hidden computer, which is actually a prop] I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!
Professor Chaos
Hey fellas? [the boys turn to see him] Fellas, could you let me out please? It uh it's been like six days. [he's in the Coon's holding cell, with a light outside by which he could see.]
Coon
You aren't going anywhere, Chaos!
Professor Chaos
Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now. [pulls the bucket into view] And I ain't got nothin' to eat.
Coon
You've got poop, don'tcha? [goes back to the other boys] Now the question is, how are we gonna get Captain Hindsight to join Coon and Friends?
Mysterion
Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?
Coon
I CARE!
Mysterion
Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.
Coon
There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!
Marine Sanctuary, day. A pelican rests on a sign at the end of a string of buoys. It takes off as a huge freighter floats by and breaks the string in two. It's a BP Oil ship
BP Man 1
All right, this looks like a jolly good place.
BP Man 2
Yes. Let's let her rip. [a crane operator pulls some levers, releasing a cable which enable a giant drill to descend into the water. The drill hits the sea bottom and all the marine animals there scatter.]
BP Man 3
That's it, lads. Collect that oil! [the drill hits some rock and shakes from the impact]
BP Man 4
Uh oh! [oil begins to ooze out of the hole into the ocean. It quickly reaches the surface and lots of dead fish pop up immediately] Oh deah.
BP Man 3
Oh, don't tell me we did it again?
The McCormick house, night. Stuart and his wife are in bed asleep; their bedroom window is open. An alarm goes off and they jump out of bed, frightened
Alarm
Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. [they exit the room and see the alarm in the hallway] All Coon Friends report to base. I'm so seriously. Emergency. Coon and Friends alert. [Kenny appears and is ready to go. He turns away and is carrying a small back pack over his right shoulder. He goes to a far window and climbs out]
The Coon's headquarters. The Human Kite, Mysterion, Mint-Berry Crunch, and Mosquito enter it and come down the stairs
Coon
Good, you're all here. Take a look at this. Coon volume up! [raises the volume. On screen is the BP oil spill]
The Gulf, in Coon-O-Vision
Reporter
It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile.
Man
It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.
Woman
Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
Cajun Shrimper
Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp!
Coon Headquarters
Mysterion
My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!
The Human Kite
We've got to help those people!
Coon
Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends.
Mint-Berry Crunch
Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor! [Cartman looks at him in disbelief]
The Gulf. As rescuers clean up as best they can, one of them looks up in the sky
Rescuer 1
[a woman] Wait a minute. Look! It's Captain Hindsight! [Captain Hindsight flies towards the rescuers and they begin cheering]
Coon
Oh no!
Captain Hindsight
What seems to be the problem?
Rescuer 2
It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned.
Rescuer 3
If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans.
Captain Hindsight
[thinks] Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?
Rescuer 3
Yes.
Captain Hindsight
It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!
Rescuer 2
Aha!
Rescuer 4
Yesss, YESSS.
Captain Hindsight
Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.
Rescuer 2
I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight.
Captain Hindsight
[thinks] Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!
Rescuer 5
My God, he's right!
Captain Hindsight
My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!
Rescuer 4
God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!!
Coon Headquarters
Coon
Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends!
Jack Brolin's mansion, day. Cartman, dressed in a business suit, rings the bell by the front door
Butler
[answering the door] Can I help you?
Cartman
I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
Butler
Yes?
Cartman
I need to speak with him, please.
Butler
The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.
Cartman
I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
Butler
Mr. Hindsight, sir. [Hindsight sits behind his desk looking at three monitors with 12 screens each. He turns around at the mention of his name] This young man would like a word.
Captain Hindsight
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?
Cartman
Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people, [sets his briefcase on the table and opens it] and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news. [takes out an application to join Coon and Friends and hands it to Hindsight] You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
Captain Hindsight
[takes the application] Of what?
Cartman
I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
Officer 2
[from one of the 36 screens] Captain Hindsight? Captain Hindsight, please come in! [Hindsight walks over to see what the matter is]
Captain Hindsight
Go ahead.
Officer 2
The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!
Captain Hindsight
Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened.
Officer 2
Right. [salutes] Thank you! [Hindsight salutes back. Another screen comes on to his right]
Fireman 2
Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying!
Captain Hindsight
Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!
Commissioner
Yes?
Captain Hindsight
Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong! [the screen the commissioner was on switches over to Santa Monica Pier as Hindsight shows his fatigue] It's not a blessing, it's a curse.
Cartman
[waits a few seconds, then] ...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
Captain Hindsight
Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.
Cartman
Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
Captain Hindsight
Get this kid out of here! I have to think!
Cartman
[gathers the form and puts it back in the briefcase] Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! [walks away]
BP Crisis special report
Anchor Man
The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement:
A BP oil rig
Tony Hayward
[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play] Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, president and CEO of BP. Our accidental drilling spill again in the Gulf is a tragedy that should have never happened. And to all those affected, I want to say, we are deeply sorry. [switch to camera 2 to his left, and he turns to look at it] We're sorry. [on the tundra dressed in winter gear, stroking a baby arctic seal] We're sorry. [in the kitchen with an apron on, taking a tray of chocolate chip cookies from the oven] We're sorry. [skis towards the camera and stops] Sorry. [back on the oil rig] BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the Gulf, and in doing so, we've changed our name from Beyond Petroleum, to Dependable Petroleum. [a shot of the Earth and Moon in an interesting configuration. The Earth has two drills attached to it, the Moon has large creators that look similar to a face, and clouds look similar to flailing arms] We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it.
Coon Headquarters. The Coon has his friends gathered around his Coon table. "QUIET. COON-FERENCE IN SESSION"
Coon
Gentlemen, my attempts to recruit Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends have been unsuccessful, but I believe I've come up with a solution. Coon Vision on! [a projector screen is shown, as is the projector on the table. Pictures begin to appear on screen] All we need to do is get pictures of Captain Hindsight naked with Courtney Love. Then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us, we'll put them on the Internet.
Toolshed
How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?
Coon
Simple, Toolshed. Coon slide 2? [the next slide clicks into place] We dress Professor Chaos up as Courtney Love, take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy, then photoshop Hindsight's face onto it.
Professor Chaos
Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love.
Coon
Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho!
Mosquito
...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.
Coon
That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!
Mosquito
Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero.
Mysterion
Agreed.
Coon
Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?!
Toolshed
Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!
Coon
You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!
Mysterion
We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!
Coon
[grudgingly] All right, Mosquito, how do you wanna help people suffering in the Gulf crisis? [crosses his arms]
Mosquito
I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.
Coon
[challenging] A bake sale?
Mosquito
I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people.
Coon
We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!
Mysterion
Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.
Iron Maiden
Timmeh!
Coon
[challenging] You think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind?
Mint-Berry Crunch
More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.
Coon
Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!
Mosquito
And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!
Coon
Oh, what are you, the boss now?!
Mosquito
No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan? [everybody but Coon raises a hand. The Iron Maiden lifts a sword]
Coon
[crosses his arms again, sarcastic] Sounds awesome. Let's do it.
Toolshed
To the grocery store!
A street in the neighborhood. Coon leads his friends down the street. A classical piece plays as the boys are shown in slow motion.
Coon
[thinking] As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself. [Coon turns to his right and high-kicks Mospuito on the cheek. Mosquito goes up in the air and bounces on the road. Coon kicks him in the balls and leaps at him, and grins. He spreads his claws out and slashes Mosquito on the left temple. Mint-Berry Crunch moves to intervene while Coon continues to rake Mosquito across the face. Coon notices Mint-Berry Crunch coming to Mosquito's aid and slashes him too.]
A dinner, later. Coon and his friends are seated around a large table. Mosquito and Mint-Berry Crunch are battered and bruised. Mosquito's vuvuzela snout is crimped
Coon
[after a while] Well, now we're back to normal. [smiles] Just like before and all forgotten? Right right?
Mint-Berry Crunch
[defeated] Right right.
Mosquito
[defeated] Right.
Coon
Keewwwl! So what's next for Coon and Friends? [no one says a word, and Coon takes a sip of his soda]
Another BP Crisis special report
Anchor Man
Another crisis in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil company DP has once again made a huge error. [a glowing plasma seeps out of a big hole while strange creatures float and walk out of there] This time, the oil company has accidentally ripped a hole into another dimension. [beachgoers run for their lives as a many-mouthed three-legged creature lumbers by. A flying creature drops down on a woman, scoops her up in its tentacles, and rips her in two at the waist. Other winged creatures swoop in and abduct other beachgoers. Different creatures walk by the pier and scoop up visitors there, then drop them into open mouths that look like Venus fly traps] The oil company stated that it knew a portal to another dimension was there, but didn't think drilling into it would prove problematic. [two men are fishing when another creature pops up and eats them] Now hundreds of creatures from another dimension are spilling out into our reality and wreaking havoc. [a giant starfish creature sits on the pier floor when a man gets curious and leans in. It snaps shut, leaving him headless. Everyone else jumps back and a woman screams]
Hayward's BP oil rig
Tony Hayward
[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play] Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, CEO of DP. Tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened. And as CEO, I would like to say... We're sorry. [sitting in an armchair by the fireplace stroking a sleeping lap puppy] We're sorry. [sitting in a prairie holding a dandelion] We're sorry. [blows the seeds off the dandelion stem. Next, he's in bed looking up somewhat seductively] Sohr-ry.
Jack Brolin's mansion, day. Captain Hindsight is at his desk looking glum.
Butler
[appears] Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!
Captain Hindsight
I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.
Butler
What, sir? You know you can tell me.
Captain Hindsight
Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?
Butler
Yes sir.
Captain Hindsight
Look at those photos on the desk. [the butler walks up to the desk and looks at the photos. The first one is Butters as Courtney Love posing for the camera and the homeless man standing on a stool behind him naked, with Hindsight's face photoshopped onto him. Next, it's Butters on the stool with the homeless man standing behind him. Next, it's Butters posing for the camera and standing on the homeless man's back]
Butler
My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?
Captain Hindsight
'Course it's Courtney Love!
Butler
But when did you have a-
Captain Hindsight
I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!
Butler
That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!
Captain Hindsight
I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-
Butler
Sir! SIR!
Another BP Crisis special report, continued
Reporter
Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, "Where is Captain Hindsight?"
Rescuer 6
Where are you, Captain Hindsight?
Cajun Shrimper
Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.
Reporter
With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now?
Coon Headquarters. The Coon has his friends gathered around his Coon table. His smear campaign is a complete success
Coon
My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!
Toolshed
There's more important things to discuss right now!
Coon
Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension?
Mysterion
He means we need to discuss things with you!
Coon
Okay, what?
Mysterion
Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!
TupperWear
I don't wanna tell him either.
The Human Kite
I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends.
Coon
You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends.
Toolshed
We all voted, it was unanimous.
Coon
You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!
The Human Kite
Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish.
Mysterion
But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.
Coon
You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!
Mysterion
We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? [she walks in and approaches Mysterion]
Liane
Yes, Mysterion?
Mysterion
Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.
Liane
[takes Coon away from the table and up the stairs] Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?
Coon
Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!
upstairs. Liane takes Coon out of the basement and shuts the door. Coon tries to get back in, but can't
Liane
Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language! [crosses her arms] Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!
Coon
[incredulous] You've gotta be fucking kidding me!
The DP boardroom, day.
DP Executive 1
Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time!
Tony Hayward
Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another "I'm sorry" campaign to please everyone this time.
DP Executive 2
Oh, what a right pickle we're in. [a flying creature floats up past the windows carrying a screaming man]
DP Executive 3
There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in.
Tony Hayward
Wait a tick! [rises] Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this!
DP Executive 4
How, by Jove?
Tony Hayward
We drill.
DP Executives
Drill of course, yes, yes, of course.
Tony Hayward
I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill.
DP Executive 5
I don't quite get it.
Tony Hayward
We got into this mess by drilling heuh [the Gulf of Mexico], and heuh [somewhere in Peru]. Now, we need to drill heuh! [draws a drill bit entering the moon]
DP Executive 6
That looks extremely promising!
Tony Hayward
Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.
DP Executive 6
The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it?
Tony Hayward
[arms crossed] Oh, she'll take it.
A launch pad, day. A DP rocket takes off
The moon. DP's newest rig is now up and running as DP astronauts spread out from the rig. Nearby are the bodies of Willzy-x and Tom Cruise
Anchor Man
The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.
Stan
Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
News 4 Breaking News: DP unleashes Cthulhu
Reporter
Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident. [Cthulhu appears looming over the oil rig in the Gulf] This time they appear to have unleashed the dark and mighty Cthulhu. [Cthulhu swats a helicopter down with just a gentle wave of his right arm] The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement:
Tony Hayward
[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play. First, Hayward is at his ranch looking at some horses. He turns around and faces the camera] As president of DP Oil, I want to say... We're sorry. [in the bathroom shaving] I'm deeply sorry. [naked on a bear rug before a fireplace, his butt cheeks rosy-red] Sorry.
Reporter
Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign.
Stan
It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! [the seven suit up and leave the house. Mysterion goes to the camera and covers it with his cape]
Cartman's room, night. Cartman is dressed as the Coon and stands in the window looking out over the backyard
Cartman
[voice over] Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
Cartman
Asshoooles! [leaps out of window]
End of Coon 2: Hindsight

Mysterion Rises
VCI Goes A Bg on it then A comic book appears from Komik Faktory Press. Mysterion. The cover has him dropping down from the sky ready for action. Mysterion's voice is heard
Mysterion
I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school. [the book opens to a random page. On that page he is defeating Professor Chaos] For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone. [a picture of the oil rig, updating every few seconds to show the spread of the oil slick] The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.
Tony Hayward
[on the rig] We're sorry.
Mysterion
But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.
Tony Hayward
[in the field, reclining for the camera] We're sorry. [some pages flip over and various creatures are shown]
Mysterion
Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.
Tony Hayward
[on the bear rug by the fireplace, naked, on his belly] Sorry. [next page has the Coon and Friends as they burst forth from headquarters. Mosquito and Human Kite are shown flying.]
Mysterion
I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! [a swarm of ?'s flies around the screen, and the name of the episode appears]
Food for Little, day. The little superheroes are at two tables selling lemon bars. Five for $3
Woman 1
Just terrific what you boys are doing.
Mysterion
Thank you, ma'am.
Man 1
[holding some bars] I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.
Field Reporter
A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little "superhuman" themselves. They call themselves "Coon and Friends," and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis.
Mysterion
We believe that every little bit helps.
Field Reporter
Their little "super club" consists of seven young heroes. [the boys each strike a pose as they announce themselves]
Toolshed
Toolshed!
Human Kite
The Human Kite!
Mysterion
Mysterion!
TupperWear
TupperWear!
Mosquito
Mosquito!
Iron Maiden
Timmah!
Mint-Berry Crunch
Mint Berry Crrrunch! [twirls around]
Field Reporter
The boys stated that there used to also be a hero named The Coon actually in the group, but they let him go because he was being quote, [reads from his cue card] "a dick".
Toolshed
Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?
Mysterion
Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that [chuckles] extremely funny.
An airport lobby. Cartman awaits his flight with several other people. The group is waiting at Gate 34.
Clerk
Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.
Passengers
Awwww!
Coon
Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW! [the other passengers look at him] Yes yes, I am the Coon.
Blonde Girl
The Coon? I've heard of that.
Coon
Ya have?
Blonde Girl
I saw on TV. That superhero group that's helping with the Gulf spill. Coon and Friends.
Coon
Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now.
Blonde Girl
Can I ask you a question?
Coon
Yes, of course.
Blonde Girl
Do you know Mint-Berry Crunch? What's he like? [Coon glares at her and then punches her out of her seat. He then pounces on her and begins to beat her up. A man comes to pull Coon off the girl, and she gets to punch him back. In comic book form, the man says "That's it, Coon!" while others cheer, "GO COON!"]
Coon
[explains what's happening in the panels. He imagines her as bigger than him] The evil girl villain fought with all her might, but the Coon was too much for her. As people looked on and cheered for the Coon, he clawed and punched the villain's stupid fat face! ["TAKE THAT YOU EVIL BITCH"] This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans!
Food for Little, day. The little superheroes are at two tables selling lemon bars, but there are a few bars left.
Mosquito
That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars.
Toolshed
Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!
Iron Maiden
Timmah! [a man with a creepy fixed grin approaches them]
Man 2
I'll take ten lemon bars.
Mosquito
Ten. Yes sir! [takes the man's cash and gives him the remaining bars]
Human Kite
That's definitely the last of them.
Man 2
You'll never stop him, you know. [Mosquito and Mint-Berry Crunch look at each other in foreboding music]
Mosquito
Stop who?
Man 2
The Great One. [his head sways back and forth as he speaks] Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon. [takes his bars, turns around and walks away. He looks back briefly] Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here. [samples one of the bars] Oh man, these are really good lemon bars. [turns around and goes to his car]
Toolshed
The Necronomicon?
TupperWear
What's a mythos?
Mysterion
I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.
Toolshed
All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!
Mint-Berry Crunch
Mint-Berry Crrunch!
Coon and Friends secret base, former Coon headquarters, Cartman's basement. The superheroes rush in to find it in ruins
TupperWear
What the hell?!
Mosquito
I knew it! Cartman tore our base up!
Mysterion
Not Cartman.
Human Kite
What do you mean "Not Cartman," dude?
Mysterion
Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.
Captain Hindsight
[silhouette, holding a gun] Don't anybody move! [comes into the light, drunk] So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me!
Toolshed
Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight.
Narrator
Captain Hindsight, [the captain takes a sip of Macallan] the hero of the modern age. Once a reporter for the National News, Jack Brolin always had a knack for hindsight. ["Perhaps they should have called the police sooner"] Wanting to become the best-known reporter in the country, Jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels. But then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment. The reporter's hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels! ["It's too much!" He holds his head together. "I shouldn't have done that!"] For months he was able to use his new powers for good, fighting for peace, and the American way. [a panel shows him helping firefighters] With his three trusty companions, Shoulda, Coulda, and Woulda. [three creatures with only hind legs and lower lips thrust out] But now, the Hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume Jack's very soul. It's Captaiiin Hindsight!
Captain Hindsight
I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!
Toolshed
Um dude, are you okay?
Captain Hindsight
[cocks and aims his pistol at the boys] Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!
Mint-Berry Crunch
P-p-please sir, w-we don't know what you mean.
Captain Hindsight
[whips out the pictures mailed to him] You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love!
Professor Chaos
Uhhh ohhh...
Mysterion
Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?!
Professor Chaos
But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been-
Captain Hindsight
Alright enough! What's going on?!
Mysterion
Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!
Captain Hindsight
It's not Courtney Love?
Mysterion
Please sir, put down the gun.
Captain Hindsight
No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!
Toolshed
Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.
Captain Hindsight
NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!
Mysterion
Then do it! [walks right up to the pistol and places himself at the end of the barrel] Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!
Human Kite
Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out.
Mysterion
You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!
Mint-Berry Crunch
[the first up the stairs] Wuh uh okay, if you insist. Uh see ya, Kenny.
Human Kite
My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I-
Mysterion
I said it's fine! Just go! [the other boys leave]
Toolshed
[stops] Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. [leaves]
The Gulf. Cthulhu is tearing the piers apart. He takes a tilt-a-whirl and throws it at the fleeing crowd. The Coon climbs up the side of a roller coaster as burning pieces of it fall down past him. Soon the beach is clear of sunbathers and Coon reaches the top of the coaster. He runs along the tracks, jumping over any breaks. He runs to the end of the track, where the rest of it is missing, and looks at the dark lord
Coon
Cthulhu! Cthulhu, dude! Over here! [Cthulhu turns around and looks at Coon] Hey Cthulhu. 'Sup? Yes, it is me, the Coon! But don't worry, I'm actually not here to fight you! We are not so different, Cthulhu. Though I am a superhero and you are a dark god from another dimension, perhaps, we can work together! [Cthulhu looks around] I know how it feels to want to take over and rule the earth and have everyone else be your slaves. I do, bro! But there's a group of superhumans who are going to stop at nothing to stop YOU! [Cthulhu leans towards Coon at eye-level] Good, I have your attention. The superhumans I speak of are right now working on plans to destroy you! They reside in Colorado and they are fucking assholes, and they all deserve to be sent into a dark oblivion! You can do that, right? Send people into a dark oblivion? 'Cause that's what those buttholes deserve! [Cthulhu withdraws and walks away] No-Dude! Dude, Colorado is that way! Where are you going?? [runs back down the track] Goddammit, why don't dark lords fuckin' listen?!
Coon and Friends secret base. Mysterion and Hindsight remain, Hindsight sways, intoxicated
Captain Hindsight
It doesn't matter. [takes a swig of Macallan] Even if the pictures are fake. I can't take it anymore. [turns away] Do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20/20 hindsight? [takes another swig] As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore!
Mysterion
People need you, Hindsight! [Hindsight takes a swig of Macallan] Without you they feel helpless and stupid.
Captain Hindsight
Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!
Mysterion
You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker! [turns around. Hindsight, curious, turns to face him] Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.
Captain Hindsight
Wha-? What is your power?
Mysterion
[turns around] I can't die. [pauses] I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes. [turns away] And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, "Oh hey Kenny." Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes. [faces Hindsight] You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.
Commercial
Announcer
And now, a special announcement from the president of BP and DP.
Tony Hayward
Hello, I'm Tony Hayward. The tragic spill in the Gulf is a disaster that should have never happened. And as head of the oil company responsible, I would like to say, what should I do? [looks at the camera to his left] Should I admit we've made mistakes? [the spill is shown again] Should I remind you we've done this before? What should I do? Should I find newer and better ways to say I'm sorry? [Jumps out of a giant three-tiered BP cake with stars on his nipples: "We're sorry."]
Captain Hindsight
[at a podium] Should I really believe I ruined my legacy? [behind him is a large banner that reads "Captain Hindsight"] What should I do?
Tony Hayward
[voice-over] What should I do?
Mysterion
[voice-over] What should I do? [shown getting a massage] Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?
Tony Hayward
Or should I tell you, "I am not a role model." [winks]
Captain Hindsight
[on the steps in the alley side of a building drinking Macallan] Seriously, what should I do?
Tony Hayward
[in Western Outlaw getup] Should I accept my role as the villain?
Mysterion
[in a familiar alley] Maybe I should just... disappear.
Tony Hayward
[at the rig inspecting the blueprints] Should I not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldn't happen? They're my technicians! [blinks twice]
Captain Hindsight
[on a darkened basketball court] Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?
Coon
[thinking on the roller coaster track] Should I just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back? Tell then that I was being a selfish jerk? [aloud] What should I do?
Captain Hindsight
[in the chair that gave him his superpower] Should I get back in the chair? Remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter? [activates the chair]
Coon
[thinking on the roller coaster track] Should I admit I was wrong? Ask for everyone's forgiveness and go back to my original team? [aloud] Nah, screw that. I'm just gonna keep bein' a fuckin' dick! [jumps off the track]
Clyde's bedroom. Coon and Friends are at a desk, with Human Kite typing away on a computer keyboard
Toolshed
All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!
Mosquito
Right, Toolshed!
Human Kite
Here we go: "The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them."
Toolshed
"It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu."
Mint-Berry Crunch
Aha! That's the cult the creepy man talked about, heroes. Uh, you okay, Mysterion?
Mysterion
[away from the group, in deep thought] I'm fine.
Human Kite
Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago.
Mysterion
So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.
Human Kite
Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents.
Mysterion
Uhh, what? [goes to see. He looks at the screen and his expression changes to one of dismay. His parents are pictured getting arrested along with the creepy man and Mr. Adler, shop teacher, among others. In his normal voice] What the fuck?! I m-I mean, [going into his superhero voice] Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! [takes over as Human Kite leaves the chair]
Betsy
[knocks on the door] Clyde? Clyde, I told you this morning to take the garbage out. [Betsy knocks some more. Mosquito, Human Kite, and Mint-Berry Crunch look at each other] Clyde, do you hear me?
Mosquito
[pulls his vuvuzela off his face] Okay Mom, just give me two minutes. [puts it back on] Nag nag nag. [buzzes a bit]
More comic book pages appear, this time with Coon on them
Coon
Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious. [a raccoon is shown aiming to grab a sandwich from someone's left hand] But sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute. [the same raccoon is shown sitting on its hind legs begging for the sandwich] Time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe. [as Cthulhu sleeps, Coon gets on its belly and giggles, then pats its belly. Cthulhu makes some sounds, then goes back to sleep] Who's the sleepy little man? [pats its belly again. This time Cthulhu sneezes and blows Coon off. Cthulhu licks his lips and goes back to sleep. Coon, undaunted, climbs right back on its belly. Giggling, he scoots closer. Cthulhu opens its eyes. Cartman smiles broadly] My name is the Little Coon. What is your name? [Cthulhu moans a bit, then open its mouth wide and roars. Coon struggles to stay on this time. When Cthulhu closes its mouth, Coon mimics him] Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [Cthulhu opens its eyes wide as Coon giggles. Cthulhu moans] You're a sleepy man ne, Cthulhu? [scratches Cthulhu's belly] Who's a needs a tummy rub? [Cthulhu makes moans happily]
The McCormicks' bedroom. Stuart smokes a joint while his wife looks on. He coughs
Mrs. McCormick
You're hoggin' it all, asshole! [she reaches for it, but he keeps it away]
Stuart
'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!
Mrs. McCormick
[she keeps reaching for it] You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!
Stuart
[pushes her off] I told you to shut up!
Mrs. McCormick
[punches him] Give to me, you prick! [they fight over the joint, suddenly realizing Mysterion is at their window watching them] AH! AAAAH! [both of them fall off the bed and then peer up from the side] Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!
Stuart
Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.
Mrs. McCormick
And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. [Stuart realizes he's still holding the joint and chucks it away]
Mysterion
I'm not here about that.
Stuart
Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what?
Mysterion
Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.
Mrs. McCormick
[looks at Stuart] We were?
Stuart
We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio.
Mysterion
Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?! [the parents look at each other]
Stuart
Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.
Mysterion
What happened at those meetings?
Stuart
Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.
Mysterion
I don't find that hard to believe at all.
Mrs. McCormick
I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.
Mysterion
These people still meet? Where?
Stuart
Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house.
Mrs. McCormick
They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do. [and with that, Mysterion vanishes. The window remains open, but no one is in it. Mrs. McCormick gets back on the bed. Stuart gets the joint back, sits next to her, and lights the joint] Did that really just happen?
Stuart
I don't think so. [takes a drag]
A news report
Field Reporter
Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news.
Coon
Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?!
Jim McElroy's house, night. In the basement a robed man leads a group of cult followers in prayer
Followers
ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
Cult Leader
The Old One has awakened! [draws back his hood; it's the creepy man, or Man 2, from earlier] A lot of us have waited a long time for this day. Well for all our South Park Cthulhu members old and new, it is time to par-tay! [lukewarm response. Outside, Coon and Friends watch from a low window]
Mysterion
There must be clubs like this all over the world.
Toolshed
We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.
Human Kite
Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids?
Pete
I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.
Michael
Yeah. I just hope he puts an end to the fucking Disney Channel.
Toolshed
Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?
Mysterion
Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.
Cult Leader
Now let us read from the Necronomicon. "That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons"
Followers
"Even Death may die." [the boys turn away from the window]
Toolshed
"In strange aeons even Death may die?" What does that mean, Human Kite?
Human Kite
I'm not sure, Toolshed. Could it be a riddle, Mysterion? M-! Mysterion? [Mysterion is gone]
Mint-Berry Crunch
Mysterion is sooo... mysterious.
News report. Jack Brolin reporting. He looks familiar...
Jack Brolin
A horrific scene of destruction, despair and terror here in New Orleans. And still there's no sign of Captain Hindsight. Rumor has it he got sick of it all, went back to his chair, and removed all his powers.
Injured Man
[in the background, walking by with his left hand over his injured right upper arm] Where are you Captain Hindsight? Aggh!
Jack Brolin
Perhaps... he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair...
An alley in South Park. The Goth kids enter
Pete
[kicks a can aside] Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school?
Michael
No, assmunch. Cthulhu just wants chaos, bedlam, and madness.
Pete
Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself. [they notice Mysterion looking at them from the edge of a roof] Who the F'n H is that?
Mysterion
[jumps off the roof and lands on the alley floor, on one knee] What does it mean? "That is not dead which can eternal lie"?
Michael
[takes a drag of his joint] "And with strange aeons even Death may die."
Mysterion
What does it mean?!
Pete
It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever.
Michael
Yeah, so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants, poser.
Mysterion
[rises and walks towards them] You're going to tell me everything you know!
Firkle
[pulls out a switch blade and opens it] Nobody's stopping Cthulhu now! All will be sadness. Life will become death, and I will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck.
Michael
Dude, that little kid is hardcore goth.
Pete
Hardcore goth.
Cult Leader
[he and Nelson appear behind Mysterion, who turns around] The child is right, you know. Cthulhu sees all, hears all. The dark lord wants us to dispense of this one, kids. Give us a hand.
Pete
Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody.
Michael
We're dark lord minions now, wuss. What'd you think we'd be doing?
Pete
Ugh, whatevs. [Mysterion is stuck between the two advancing cult members and the Goth kids.]
The Gulf sky, dark and stormy. Coon rides on Cthulhu. Upbeat music plays

The alley. There is no escape
Cult Leader
Just hold still and it will all be over quickly. [a buzzing sound is heard, and all look to see who it is]
Mosquito
Let him go! [he's on the roof of a building] Coon and Friends, ho! Mosquito!

Toolshed
Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!
Cult Leader
Sorry kids. It's a little late for that. [takes the switchblade from the Kindergoth and stabs Mysterion with it. The cult members and the Goth kids disperse as Mysterion coughs and stumbles. Mysterion stops and then falls flat on his back]
Toolshed
Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!
Human Kite
You bastards! [a pool of blood appears under Kenny when someone knocks on a door somewhere. All of a sudden, Kenny is back in his room, in bed, in his same old clothes. More knocking]
Kenny's room
Toolshed
Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!
Mosquito
Yeah, come on, get your costume on, lazy-ass!
Human Kite
[jumps in the air] Let's go. [the boys move on]
Mint-Berry Crunch
Mint-Berry Crunch! [Kenny sighs]
End of Mysterion Rises

Coon vs. Coon & Friends
A new comic book. The speech bubbles give the hero away: this comic book is about Mintberry Crunch. On the page, two villains run from the flying half-man half-berry
Mintberry Crunch
Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mintberry Crunch! [The camera pulls out to reveal the whole page, which is a cover of "the AMAZING MINTBERRY CRUNCH"] Our story begins in a remote corner of the Gulf of Mexico. [a graphic of the BP oil rig is shown] The BP Oil Company drills into the ocean floor, [a graphic of a fire destroying the rig] but they drill too much, and the BP Oil Company accidentally unleashes Cthulhu, an ancient evil god from another dimension. Halfway across the country, [Coon & Friends in their normal outfit are shown, with Bradley as the leader instead of Stan] a mild-mannered attractive fourth-grader, Bradley Biggle, hears of the disaster on the news while with his friends. [the page flips over and Bradley is shown transforming] But Bradley Biggle is no ordinary fourth-grader! Not long ago, he realized he had superpowers he could call upon by turning in place and saying the magic word, "Shablagoo!" And in a flash, Bradley is transformed into the thrilling superhero, Mintberry Crunch! Joined by the other Coon Friends, Mintberry Crunch went to investigate the Gulf spill crisis! The superheroes came across a cult, in existence for years, that had been waiting for Cthulhu's arrival. They are the key to stopping Cthulhu from taking over the world! Sometimes, when everything seems hopeless, that's when you need to bring it all. [Mintberry Crunch stands at the corner of a roof in a heroic pose] That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch!
Coon and Friends Secret Base. The Friends are there listening to Mintberry Crunch
Toolshed
[after a few seconds of silence] Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?
Mintberry Crunch
Rrright!
Human Kite
But then what exactly is your superpower?
Mintberry Crunch
The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch!
Toolshed
...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-
Human Kite
nd shoot lasers out of my eyes.
Toolshed
And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can... [pauses and looks over at Mysterion.] Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?
Mysterion
[with his back to the group] I can't die!
Toolshed
...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-
Mysterion
No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!
Toolshed
...Woo-hat?
Mysterion
[turns to face them] Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed "Oh my God," and you called him a bastard!
Human Kite
[arms down and out, palms out] When was that?
Mysterion
All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!
Toolshed
...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.
Mysterion
Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!
Toolshed
[notices Mintberry Crunch] Dude, you're freaking out Mintberry Crunch. He's peed his pants. [Mintberry Crunch notices that he has indeed peed his pants and covers his groin quickly]
Mintberry Crunch
Nono. Mintberry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants!
Mysterion
[turns away] I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.
Human Kite
[approaches him] Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die.
Mysterion
[confronts him] Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!
Toolshed
Kenny Kenny, calm down.
Mysterion
It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me! [walks away, then turns around] Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! [pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head]
Toolshed
Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!
Human Kite
Dude!
Mintberry Crunch
Is he? Oh Jesus! [flees up the stairs and out of the basement]
Toolshed
[draws closer] Kenny? No! No!
The Coon comic book. On the cover, Cartman carries an American flag while Cthulhu stands behind him wearing a Coon and Friends shirt. The story unfolds with a few embellishments in the design of the secret base
Coon
Gather around, believers in good, and listen to the newest installment of The Coon. It all began when the BP Oil Company drilled into the ocean floor and ripped open a hole into another dimension. Seeing the disaster on Coon-Vision, the Coon immediately called together his trusty Coon Friends. As the Coon explained how the disaster could be stopped, something terrible happened. Without warning, the Coon friends changed. Their superpowers morphed somehow, turning them into... supervillains. [the friends are depicted with evil grins] The Coon tried to reason with them, tried to bring them back to the side of good, ["Heroes must be good. Go with Christ!"] but it was too late. [Human Kite: "GET OUT!!!" Mysterion: "WE ARE EVIL NOW!"] Their black hearts had been tainted by hate and rage. The Coon was alone, turn by the ultimate dilemma. [Coon is shown sitting on Lincoln's shoulder at the Lincoln Memorial] He had to put a stop to the evil villains, even though they had once been his friends. Sometimes, to fight the ultimate evil, you must make friends with enemies. [Coon is showing looking at Cthulhu] The Coon teamed up with Cthulhu, because even Cthulhu knows what evil assholes Kyle and Stan and those guys are! And that they are manipulative, uncaring, vagina faces! They're all planning to destroy the world. Only one thing can stop them: the Coon. With Cthulhu's help, I can try to banish them to a dark oblivion, for all eternity. [the Friends are shown surrounding a glowing globe of Earth with evil grins on their faces] I will not rest until that happens.
South Park, Cartman's street, day. Cartman is walking home and approaches the front door
Coon
Bab-ay,
I know you're askin' me to stay
Say "Please please please don't go away."
You say I'm givin' you the blues.
[enters the house]
Mayb-ay,
you mean every word you say
Can't help but think-

Liane
[confronts him with her arms crossed over her chest] Eric Cartman!
Coon
Hi Mom.
Liane
Where have you been, young man?!
Coon
Just doin' stuff Mom. Are my friends downstairs in the secret base?
Liane
Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!
Coon
[turns around and thinks hard, to himself] The Coon's mother appears to be extremely upset. In order to get past her, I must use the LeBron James technique.
Liane
Eric, are you listening to me?!
Coon
[faces Liane] Mom... what should I do?
Liane
[disarmed] What?
Coon
What should I do? Should I admit I made mistakes? Should I say I've done this before? Should I write a song about how I should have stayed in my room? What should I do?
Liane
What do you mean "what should-"
Coon
Should I say I am not a role model? Should I not listen to my conscience? It's my conscience, Mom! What should I do? Go back to my room and pretend nothing happened? Not jump out the window and fly to New Orleans? What should I do, Ma? Tell me!
Liane
[overwhelmed] I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. [runs off to the kitchen]
Coon and Friends Secret Base. The Friends are at the table
Human Kite
Alright Coon and Friends, what good deed should we do next?
Mosquito
Perhaps we should make more lemon bars to raise money for people in need.
TupperWear
Okay!
Mysterion
You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?
Toolshed
Uh-what?
Mysterion
What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.
Human Kite
Yeah cool let's talk about where our powers come from.
Mosquito
I was bitten by a radioactive mosquito! Bzzzzzzt.
TupperWear
I was in a car accident, then put back together with Tupperware parts.
Iron Maiden
Tih-Timmieh!
Mysterion
iill you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!
Coon
[appearing on the basement stairs] Hey guys. [the Friends look at him] So, what's goin' on?
Toolshed
Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?
Coon
No, I, I know. That's cool, I understand. Even though I started it and the secret base is in my house. Yes, that's totally understandable.
Human Kite
You just wanted to frame and blackmail people, then you beat up Clyde and Bradley for no reason!
Coon
No you're right. For no reason. Clearly something is wrong with me. But you guys, what should I do?
Human Kite
You should fuck off, that's what you should do.
Coon
[sees the LeBron James technique isn't working] Hm. Ah, all right, look. You guys were totally right, okay? That's all I wanted to say. That and... there's a double rainbow outside.
Mintberry Crunch
A what?
Coon
Double rainbow, you guys. You don't see 'em often, but there's one outside right now. You've gotta come see! [rushes up the stairs and out of the secret base]
Mintberry Crunch
A double rainbow? Shablagoo! [the heroes all leave their seats]
Human Kite
Wait, Mintberry Crunch ya you might not wanna go- [goes up the stairs with the others]
Professor Chaos
Huhey, can I see the double rainbow, fellas? [softly] Uh, fellas?
Cartman's house, front lawn, day. Coon leads the friends out
Coon
Isn't it beautiful you guys?
Human Kite
There's no double rainbow, fatass!
Coon
You are correct, Human Kike! Not that supervillains like you guys could ever see a double rainbow!
Mosquito
What are you talking about?
Coon
Your evil-doing days are over, Mosquito! All of you shall now be dealt the swift hand of justice!
Human Kite
Cartman, you are the bad guy, not us!
Coon
Nuh uh, you guys are the bad guy. [whistles. A gust of wind blows leaves at the boys, and heavy footsteps follow. Cthulhu soon stands before the Friends, who look at him in awe]
Mintberry Crunch
Waaaaaaaaaah! [runs off]
Mysterion
What are you doing with that thing?!
Coon
He's going to help me get rid of you guys so together we can make the world a better place!
Human Kite
Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy!
Coon
No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!
Human Kite
Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!
Coon
[thinks it over, then crosses his arms] Well, that's why Superman isn't around anymore, isn't it? Cthulhu! Banish them to a dark oblivion, please! [Cthulhu opens his right paw and sweeps it from left to right in the air. The boys scream and become deformed, then disappear] Aww! Dude, that was awesome! You're all like "Mehhhh" and they were all like "Nooo!"
Night. Coon and Cthulhu sit in a valley somewhere with a large city in the distance.
Coon
All right, now, we've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco, sent my friends into a dark oblivion, and so our next order of business will be Burning Man. [Cthulhu roars softly] Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world, and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out. Pretty soon, the whole wold will be transformed thanks to the Coon! [Cthulhu roars softly] Yes yes, the Coon and Friend. Now after Burning Man we'll take down Whole Foods alright? [Cthulhu repositions himself to confront Coon and roars loudly. Coon thinks] The dark lord is agitated and the LeBron James technique might not work. The Coon will have to use an even more manipulative technique. Time to bust out: Cute Kitten. [aloud] Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. [climbs up onto Cthulhu.] Meow meow meow. [digs his blades into Cthulhu's back and massages him while at the same time making a comfortable place to nap in. Cthulhu's face softens and he giggles, then looks back at Cartman sleeping on his back. Cthulhu blinks several times, then walks forward softly]
a strange place altogether
Toolshed
Dude, where the fuck are we?
Mysterion
I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before. [huge butterfly-like creatures pop up from behind some plants]
a new installment of the Amazing Mintberry Crunch. He remembers things a bit differently...
Mintberry Crunch
And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mintberry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him!
the strange place. The Friends run and scream until they reach a cliff
Toolshed
Oh shit!
Human Kite
[panting] We aren't going that way!
Mosquito
You guys, I wanna go home.
Toolshed
We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here.
Mosquito
Look, maybe we should just a place to hid and wait for help.
Human Kite
What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here.
Mysterion
Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. [moves away from the cliff]
Toolshed
How, dude?
Human Kite
Kenny, where the hell are you going?
Mysterion
I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. [runs towards the cliff]
Mosquito
Kenny! [Kenny jumps off the cliff and impales himself on some big spiky plants ]
Mysterion
Ow! That fucking HURTS! [moans a few times and dies.]
Toolshed
Oh my God! Kenny!
Human Kite
You... you crazy bastard! [the boys turn away from the edge, seemingly forgetting their dead friend below]
Kenny's room, night. Kenny is back in his bed and wakes up. He sits up and checks himself out. Satisfied that he's alright, he jumps off the bed and goes to his closet, opens it and pulls a curtain off a hidden chest of drawers. He opens the top drawer and pulls out a Mysterion costume.
The living room. As his parents watch TV, Kenny runs past them and out the front door.
Burning Man Festival, Black Rock City, day. Dance music pumps along
Man 1
[on a fish-cycle] It's burning Man!
Man 2
[dressed as an angel] Biggest party in the world, baby! [more shots of the festival are shown. It's a carnival, but a roar changes all that. Cthulhu appears and throws an RV into the festival, and everyone scatters]
Coon
[on Cthulhu's back] Fucking hippies! Fuck all o'you! [Cthulhu raises his left paw and unleashes a lightning bolt upon a girl, incinerating her and leaving nothing but bones]
Reporter
The dark and evil Cthulhu is bringing his angry wrath down upon the Burning Man Festival, Tom. Cthulhu isn't behaving as most scientists had speculated, Tom, but the dark lord is wreaking havoc everywhere and-
Coon
[walks up and interrupts him] No nonono! Excuse me! It is not Cthulhu, it is Coon and Friend! I'm a little sick of everyone giving him all the credit when I'm the one really making the world a better place!
Reporter
Tom, it appears that Bruce Vilanch has arrived on the scene wearing a rat costume.
Coon
[greatly insulted by the reporter's comment] Oh, you motherfucker! [runs towards Cthulhu] Cthulhu, this guy too! [Cthulhu unleashes more lightning and the reporter is incinerated] Kewl. Oh get that fire-twirling hippie bitch.
Henrietta's bedroom, night. The Goth kids are sitting around on her red throw rug. Red Goth strikes a lighter and it lights up. He then blows out the flame. Kindergoth taps his cigarette onto an ash tray.
Michael
This freaking sucks! We worshiped and prayed to Cthulhu, went to all the cult meetings, but life is still totally freaking gay.
Pete
I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled.
Mysterion
How to I fight him? [the Goth kids look at the window and see him there]
Michael
Oh joy, it's Underwear Boy again.
Mysterion
That god you pray to just took away all my friends.
Pete
Not our god. He promised everything would change if we worshiped him, but we're still sitting here smoking cigarettes like before [hair flip] It's like Obama all over again.
Mysterion
How do I fight him?!
Pete
Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright?
Mysterion
Tell me what that means! [the bedroom door opens and Henrietta's mom appears]
Mrs. Biggle
Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you.
Henrietta
Go away Mom, I hate you.
Mrs. Biggle
Just let your little brother play with your friends, sweetie. He's lonely. Go on in, Bradley. [Bradley appears and enters the room]
Bradley
Will you guys play with me?
Henrietta
Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!
Bradley
Please, can I just- oh g'uh! [sees Mysterion in the window] Mu-Mysterion! Wuh what's goin'- Uh, that's okay, sis. I'll play with you another time. [leaves and closes the door]
the hallway. Bradley round the corner and walks to his room
Bradley
Mysterion is here! He must have come for my help. [enter his room] No time to waste. Time for Bradley Biggle to transform. [opens a drawer under his nightstand and sees his costume] Shablagoo! [turns in place]
Henrietta's bedroom. As Bradley transforms, Henrietta explains to Mysterion how to fight Cthulhu. She starts with the Necronomicon
Henrietta
Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. [the first page shows a Prince Abdul Al-Kazred in 700 A.D. The next one has the prince genuflecting before an Old One.]
Mysterion
One Ones?
Michael
Dark deities that existed before man.
Henrietta
It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.
Mysterion
That's it! That's the place I just was!
Michael
You've been to the nightmare city of R'Lyeh?
Pete
Luckyyy...
Henrietta
Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.
Mysterion
And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?
Henrietta
The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. [Henrietta's door opens again and Mintberry Crunch barges into the room]
Mintberry Crunch
Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mintberry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists!
Henrietta
Get out of my room, TWERP!
Mintberry Crunch
Mintberry Crunch isn't afraid of his fat sister! Grab her legs, Mysterion! [Mysterion is gone] M- Mysterion? [the Goth kids turn to look at the window.] Aw crap. [runs out of the room]
The street. Mysterion walks down the street briskly when Mintberry Crunch opens the front door and sees him
Mintberry Crunch
Hey Mysterion, wait up! [leaves the door open] Come on, wait uuup! [catches up to him] Us Coon Friends need to stick together remember? Where are you going?
Mysterion
Wherever Cthulhu is!
Mintberry Crunch
What? But he'll kill you.
Mysterion
Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.
Mintberry Crunch
Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.
Mysterion
You don't understand!
Mintberry Crunch
[turns away from Mysterion] How was it that mint and berry came together delivering full flavor in an intense crunch? [Mysterion leaves] We must find out answers Mysterion. [turns around, but doesn't immediately see him] Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you.
The Coon comic book, four pages in
Coon
After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped.
Justin Bieber concert at Staples Center
Justin Bieber
[grabbing his crotch constantly, and singing badly off-key] Babih babih babih oooo! Babih babih babih oooo! Babig baibig woo woo, Bay-wooo [Cthulhu reaches down and grabs him off the stage] Wooooo-ooo-oo! [Cthulhu grumbles]

Coon
Yep, that's him. So long, Justin Bieber, you little douchebag! [Cthulhu crushes Bieber between his forefinger and thumb like a grape]
Reporter 2
The dark god Cthulhu continues his rampage of destruction and terror, and there seems to be no hope for man. I'm joined now by a supposed team member of Cthulhu, the Coon.
Coon
It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice.
Reporter 2
Good and justice? J-Justin Bieber and most of his fans have just been massacred.
Coon
Yes, Coon and Friends are happy to help. We do not need thanks for our deeds. We do not want gifts, all we want is for people to buy our Coon and Friends T-Shirts for $14.95.
Mysterion
Hey, fat boy!
Coon
Kenny? What the hell? I sent you to the-
Mysterion
To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars! [approaches him] You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!
Coon
It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny!
Mysterion
You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!
Coon
I'm going around making the world a better place!
Mysterion
For you! You're making it a better place for you!
Coon
Right, that's what superheroes do.
Mysterion
No! This is what superheroes do! [walks up to Cthulhu] You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?! [that gets Cthulhu's attention] Bring back my friends! Take me!
Mintberry Crunch
[gets through the police line] Mysterion, no! What are you doing?!
Mysterion
[to Mintberry Crunch] Only an immortal can kill another immortal! [to Cthulhu] Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!
Coon
[stands next to Mysterion] Don't listen to him Cthulhu! We have more important stuff to do!
Mysterion
Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!
Coon
Cthulhu, you are a Coon Friend, and I'm the Coon! You will listen to me! [Cthulhu picks Coon up and scolds him, then cradles him. Coon takes the hint and scrambles onto Cthulhu's back. Coon kneads Cthulhu's back again and Cthulhu is relieved. Coon is asleep on Cthulhu's back and Cthulhu turns and walks away]
Mysterion
No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!
Coon
Fuck you, Kenny!
Mysterion
Come back, you fat piece of shit! [notices something in the sky. Others notice too. A bright object descends onto the parking lot and dims enough to reveal a giant oval shaped light that serves as a holograph. An image of a man appears inside and begins to talk. Mysterion is puzzled]
Alien Man
Hello my son. If you are seeing this message, then it must be dark times. And you must have many questions. Your true name is Gok'Zarah. The power given to you comes from a planet far away. You are from that planet, Gok'Zarah. It is for that reason you have a power that normal humans do not have. I know you must sometimes see this power as a curse, but you were sent here to stop evil from taking over the Earth and now, that time has apparently come. You must now harness and focus your power, Gok'Zarah. The power of mint and berries yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch.
Mintberry Crunch
...Uh yes. Yes, please go on.
Alien Man
Your home planet, K'oh Kajan, is known throughout the universe for its berry mines. Berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. Needless to say, when the mint hunters of Kogenrah got word of them, our fate was already sealed, Gok'Zarah. But our two worlds collided and soon, mint and berry were one.
Mintberry Crunch
Wow!
Alien Man
Your mother and I sent you as far away as we could. Use your power, son. Save Earth. Shablagoo! [the orb rises up and away]
Mintberry Crunch
I will, father. No more running away for... Mintberry Crunch! [jumps up in the air and floats up, then aims at Cthulhu and flies towards him] Hello, Cthulhu, I heard you haven't been "berry" nice! [unleashes a torrent of berries at him. Cthulhu shields himself, but doesn't go down.] Not enough, huh? Maybe the intense flavor of mint will freshen things up! [Cthulhu is soon enveloped in a tornado of mint leaves]
The Amazing Mintberry Crunch. The following is illustrated in the comic book
Mintberry Crunch
I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister. ["Fuck you! I have powers you fat bitch!"]
Coon and Friends Secret Base, later. The Coon Friends are all there
Toolshed
Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mintberry Crunch.
Mintberry Crunch
Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis.
Human Kite
And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs. [the Coon is in his own holding cell with Professor Chaos]
Coon
Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!
Human Kite
You're not going anywhere for a long time!
Coon
This is inhumane! There's a big bucket with Butters' poop in here, and there's nothing to eat!
Toolshed
Ya got poop, don't ya?
Mintberry Crunch
Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents.
Human Kite
Well, come back and visit any time, dude.
Mintberry Crunch
I will. Shaaablagoo! [twirls in place and disappears in a streak of light, leaving behind berry cereal]
Coon
Fuckin' Mintberry fuckin' Crunch.
Toolshed
Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?
Mysterion
Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. [takes a gun out and just shoots himself in the head. The other boys jump back in shock.]
Toolshed
Oh my God! Holy shit dude!
Human Kite
Kenny? No! Nooo!
Kenny's parents room, night. They're asleep, but something wakes Mrs. McCormick up. Stomach pains; labor pains. She sits up holding her belly
Stuart
What? Whaaat?!
Mrs. McCormick
It's happenin' again! [falls back on the bed and raises her legs in the air.]
Kenny's room, moments later. The parents enter. Stuart turns on the light. Mrs. McCormick holds baby Kenny in her arms while Stuart sets out a parka for Kenny to sleep in. Mrs. McCormick zips it up and the parents leave the room
Mrs. McCormick
[before closing the door] We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. [Stuart turns off the light and Mrs. McCormick closes the door]
End of Coon vs. Coon & Friends

The Marsh house, living room, night. Randy and Sharon are watching TV on the sofa, under a blanket
Reporter
Passenger said the Carnival cruise line smelled like poop, but that that was an improvement.
Sharon

Randy
Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
Sharon
[going up stairs, she stops and turns around] Randy, do not watch that no-no channel.
Randy
Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!
Sharon
Alright, come to bed soon.
Randy
Psseh... huh... [glances at the stairs to see if Sharon is gone, then quickly begins changing channels. He stops at a channel where music is playing] Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot... [starts masturbating under the sheet] Oh yeah. Fuck.
Guy Fieri
[showing off some ribs] Mmm, just look at that rack of ribs; now those are slow-cooked, and then braised to bring out the smokey flavor.
Randy
Mmm, God damn. Yeah.
Guy Fieri
[hods up a rib to the camera] See how that just falls off the bone? [eats some more off it] Mmm, that is MONEY right there!
Randy
Yeah, it's fuckin' money.

The Marsh kitchen, morning. Randy's been busy cooking breakfast. Stan, Shelly, and Sharon enter the kitchen
Stan
Dad, what are you doing?
Randy
Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
Stan
Aw crap. [they go to the breakfast table while Randy serves up their dishes]
Randy
Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche. [scoops some out to spread on Stan's plate, slooowly] Aw yeah... Awwww...
Sharon
[on to him] Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!
Randy
No!
Sharon
Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.
Randy
Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking! [grabs his coat and heads for the garage. He opens the door and takes a look back] I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. [closes the door and leaves. The others look at him leave, then look at the dishes on the counter. That's a lot of bowls]
Stan
Can I have a Pop Tart?
The Marsh house, living room, afternoon. Stan and friends are on the sofa watching TV
Kyle
Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
Terrance
Hello, and welcome to Progressive. [a Progressive spoof]
Phillip
[with his wife, Katherine] Yes, we're looking to buy car insurance.
Terrance
Well, you've come to the right place. [farts on Phillip's face]
Phillip
Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico! [Kyle says this part with him] Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.
Randy
[quickly arrives, takes off his coat, and takes over. The boys get off the sofa] Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. [On TV, a chef presents his latest creation]
Alton Brown
Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action.
Randy
Aw yeah, look at that.
Stan
Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
Randy
I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
Alton Brown
We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over.
Randy
[almost breaks a sweat] Oh my God that's awesome! Oh... [looks at the boys, then takes the blanket hanging on the back of the sofa and puts it over his groin, keeping himself in check] Oh, oh. [starts masturbating] ...Yeah. Whoa.
Alton Brown
Now let's get that on the grill.
Randy
See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
Alton Brown
Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for.
Randy
Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and... [the boys notice the fierceness in his voice] Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!
Announcer
We'll be right back to Good Eats.
Commercial
Woman 1
Hey ladies, are you looking for a better workout?
Randy
[the fierceness vanishes] Aww, stupid commercials.
Woman 1
Introducing the Shake Weight. A spring-loaded workout device you pump with your arms. Just grab the piston and go to work. One-handed or double-fisted.
Randy
[yawns] Come on!
Woman 1
You just shake it. Back and forth.
Woman 2
It feels really good in my hands.
Woman 1
Best of all, Shake Weight tells you when your workout is finished by chiming and releasing a cool-down spray. [the Shake Weight chimes and gives two squirts of the cool-down spray]
Randy
Bohh-riiing.
Woman 1
Order now and we'll include the optional heart rate monitor. Just put your finger in the tester. [a woman shows how it's done] and Shake Weight takes your pulse. [another woman finishes her exercises and gets two squirts] Get yours today.
Announcer
Now back to Good Eats.
Alton Brown
Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing.
Randy
[back to masturbating] Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.
Alton Brown
Alright now, here's the really cool part. What we're gonna do is- [a short beep is heard and the screen goes blue. In white letters, this appears:]
HODNOTA!
Parental Controls
/center></poem>
Randy
Channel blocked? [begins clicking channels] What the? The hell? [goes to the master bedroom and finds Sharon clicking away on another remote control] Sharon, what are you doing?
Sharon
Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
Randy
I wasn't watching food channels!
Sharon
Then how do you know I blocked them?
Randy
I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! [walks away thwarted and goes to his den. He picks up a cordless phone on the way. He leaves the lights off in there and walks to his desk, dialing a number. He sits down as his call is answered]
Hotline Man
Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say "crème fraîche."
Randy
Crème fraîche.
Amanda
Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?
Randy
Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
Amanda
I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.
Randy
[piqued] Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
Amanda
Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes.
Randy
Yeah?
Amanda
Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.
Randy
You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
Amanda
Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
Randy
If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
Amanda
I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard. [upstairs Sharon picks up the phone to make a call, but she hears the conversation and stops to listen]
Randy
Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
Amanda
I was thinking about shallots, actually.
Randy
Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
Sharon
Randy! Marsh!
Randy
WAH! Sharon!
Hotline Man
Your time on Food Network Hotline has expired. To add more time say "crème fraîche."
The Broflovski kitchen. Sheila sits at the breakfast table as Sharon paces back and forth wiping some tears from her eyes
Sharon
I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.
Sheila
Sharon, I'm so sorry.
Sharon
It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.
Sheila
Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.
Sharon
Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
Sheila
There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
Bed, Bath & Beyond, day. Sharon enters the store and hears oooh's and aaah's and sees some women trying out the Shake Weights. She walks up to the display table. A store associate walks up to her
Associate
Help you find anything? [the name tag says Michael]
Sharon
Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?
Michael
Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?
Sharon
Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
Michael
Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out. [the woman is having some difficulty with the large Shake Weight]
Sharon
I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
Michael
Small white ones, yes ma'am. [picks up two different models] Standard or voice assist model?
Sharon
Well I don't know-
Michael
I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.
The Marsh house, master bedroom. Sharon is working with the Shake Weight now, starting with the right arm.
Shake Weight
You are doing excellent. Great work. Now switch arms. [Sharon switches arms] Wow. Good job. [Sharon begins to gasp for air] You are amazing. You are very attractive and interesting.
Sharon
Thank you, Shake Weight.
Shake Weight
Come on now. Almost finished. [Sharon begins to shake the weight faster] Yes. Good. Almost done. [Sharon shakes the weight even faster and begins to grunt] Keep going. Keep going. Harder. Faster. [Sharon's giving it all she's got, and a bell sounds. She gets two squirts]
Sharon
Hahhh.
Shake Weight
Your workout is finished. [a different bell sounds and Sharon twists the Shake Weight around to get some change] Here is some cab fare.
Sharon
Oh wow.
Shake Weight
Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]
South Park Elementary cafeteria, day. The boys stand in line for lunch
Stan
You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
Cartman
[sarcastic] Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. [the line moves forward and the boys enter to see... Randy as the school chef]
Randy
Hello there, children!
Stan
Awww what?!
Randy
How's it goin'? [behind him is restaurant-quality cooking equipment]
Stan
No, dad! No!
Randy
The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
Stan
Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
Randy
I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
Cartman
Lobster foam? [Stan shuts his eyes and buries his nose in his right hand] It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
Randy
Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.
Stan
Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
Randy
Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion! [starts spreading the aioli over the pizza] Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
The Marsh house, after school. Sharon is in the kitchen washing the mountain of dishes Randy left in the morning and she's not happy about it. Stan opens the front door and enters the living room, closes the door and walks to the kitchen.
Stan
Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
Sharon
Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
Stan
Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
Sharon
You think your father's gonna listen to me?! [something begins to beep nearby and Sharon looks at it, then goes to the breakfast table. On it is the beeping Shake Weight]
Shake Weight
This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout.
Sharon
Oh. [picks up the weight and begins to shake it] This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.
Shake Weight
That's it. Work it. Harder, faster.
Stan
Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
Sharon
[sighs] Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! [Stan just looks at her now]
Shake Weight
You are independent and strong.
Sharon
Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
Shake Weight
Switch arms.
Sharon
[switch] I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!
Shake Weight
You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger. [Sharon puts her left index finger into the device.] Do not stop your arms. Keep going. Good. Get your finger up there a little more. Your pulse is one hundred forty-five. [Sharon shakes the weight harder] Faster. Harder.
South Park Elementary cafeteria kitchen, day. Randy is behind the food counter acting as if he's on TV.
Randy
Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh [in an Italian accent] mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.
Montage. Randy beings out some muffins from the oven, then stirs some soup
Randy Singing
La lalala la la...

Randy
[glazing some marbled beef] Aww, fuck yeah. [next he chops onions]
Randy Singing
Lalalalala la, fraîche, fraîche.

Randy
[sniffing the aroma of freshly cooked turkey surrounded by russet potatoes] Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... [takes a small torch to some quiches, shows off a new dish on a fancy plate on a regular tray, squirts out some dinner roll batter on a cooking sheet, grinds some pepper onto a baked ham, flambés some shrimp, checks out some pork chops he's got cooking in the oven and likes what he sees]
Randy Singing
Crème fraîche, Cafeteria Fraîche. Lalalalala fraîche. Ho ho hohoho.

Stan
Dad, what are you doing?
Randy Singing
[as his head floats across the screen] Fraîche. [a logo finally shows up]

Randy
Fraîche.
Randy Singing
Cafeteria Fraîche.

Randy
Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan. [does so] Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...
Craig
Can we have some food, please? [behind him stand Craig, Kevin, and some more fourth graders]
Randy
Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche. [the crew is shown: Stan operates the camera, Kyle the boom mike, Cartman and Kenny the klieg lights. Randy grates the cheese over the ziti] Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.
Stan
Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
Randy
Quiet on set, please.
Stan
No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
Randy
[distracted] Back from where?
A beach somewhere. A small table holding a bucket of ice and two Coronas is shown with a chaise longue on either side. On the right one is Sharon, on the left one is the Shake Weight
Sharon
Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.
Shake Weight
You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to.
Sharon
Oh, thanks Shake Weight.
Shake Weight
You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident.
Sharon
You're right.
Shake Weight
Tell me again about the women who you do not like.
Sharon
Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.
Shake Weight
Oh you are so witty and alarmingly insightful. [two beeps] How about a quick workout?
Sharon
[takes off her sunglasses] A workout? Right now?
Shake Weight
Just a quickie. You can do it.
Sharon
I don't really like working out in public.
Shake Weight
Come on. You can do it. [Sharon thinks about it, then picks up the weight with her left hand and shakes it. At first she keeps it at a distance, but soon shakes it normally] That's it. Good. Keep it up. Feel the burn. Harder. Faster. [Sharon does as told] You are amazing. Switch arms. [Sharon switches] Oh that's it. Yes. You are getting really good at this. You are capable of anything. Harder, faster. [Sharon does as told] I said faster. More. Do it. You are almost there. Home stretch. Oh yes. [a ring and two squirts] Your workout is finished. Your cab fare. [pours out some fare onto Sharon's left hand] Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]
A drama/music classroom at South Park Elementary. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny enter through an open door
Kyle
We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
Stan
He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
Kyle
He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
Cartman
[on stilts, dressed as Ramsay] Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
Stan
That's stupid, Cartman.
Kyle
He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
Kenny
(Yeah, it's really good.)
Kyle
Let's hear it, Cartman!
Cartman
Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
Stan
You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
Randy
[enters the room] Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay! [backs out the door quickly and hides behind the door. Stan follows him out] Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
Stan
...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
Randy
Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!
A hotel room. Sharon is sleeping in bed when something begins to beep. Sharon wakes up and looks around, gets up and goes to the dresser and opens a drawer. Inside, she sees the Shake Weight blinking and beeping. She picks up the weight in her right hand
Shake Weight
You have not worked out in seven hours.
Sharon
Oh God, not right now.
Shake Weight
Come on. Let's get to it.
Sharon
Ugh, I'm tired.
Shake Weight
You have not worked out in seven hours.
Sharon
Oh, where is that sleep mode button?
Shake Weight
Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast?
Sharon
Ugghh.
Shake Weight
Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please.
Sharon
[sighs] All right. Fine. [a few moments later, with the lights on, she begins shaking the weight]
Shake Weight
That's it. Good. [Sharon sighs] A little faster. Harder. [Sharon simply switches arm position, but doesn't shake any faster] Come on. Get into it. That's it. Now switch arms. [Sharon switches] You are so attractive and you have interesting things to say. [Sharon shakes the weight faster, but soon has to support her left arm with her right hand] Come on. You are almost there. Faster. Do it faster. [ding, two squirts, some change comes out] Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]
Sharon
[relieved] Ahhh.
South Park Elementary, day. In the cafeteria kitchen, Cartman tries to discourage Randy any way he can
Cartman
[still dressed as Ramsay] What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
Randy
Yes chef!
Cartman
Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
Stan
Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
Randy
No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!
Stan
Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! [another camera crew comes in, with another chef]
Bobby Flay
Uh, excuse me. Randy Marsh?
Randy
Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
Bobby Flay
I heard that Gordon Ramsay had taken an interest in your cafeteria food. So now I would like to challenge you to a school cafeteria food throwdown!
Randy
Whoa, are you serious?? [fist pump] Yes, yes!
Announcer
A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme?
Stan
Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
Jamie Oliver
[appears] Hold on. Wait. School cafeteria food needs to be healthy. [begins to cry] Why, why won't people listen to me?
Randy
Jamie Oliver!
Announcer
And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen [she waves], and Giata De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head.
Kyle
Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
The hotel, day. Sharon arrives at her hotel room only to find it closed. A sign hangs on the door.
Sharon
"Your room is being serviced"? Ugh, oh well. [enters the room and finds the maid working out with the Shake Weight] Uhh, excuse me?
Rosemary
Oh, [turns around] uh no, no, [tosses the Shake Weight onto the bed] sorry. I done with cleaning, [runs to her cleaning tray and exits with it] thank you. Please, sorry. [after she leaves Sharon drops her shopping bag and walks to the bed. She crosses her arms and looks at the Shake Weight angrily]
Shake Weight
...What's the big deal? She wanted to work out. You never want to work out. I just needed help going to sleep. Mode. ...What? ...What? Come on. What? You are amazing and irreplaceable. What? How about a quick workout? What? [moments later Sharon is on the phone with the manufacturer]
Sharon
[pacing back and forth] Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!
Shake Weight
This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break.
Sharon
Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
Shake Weight
You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like.
Sharon
I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!
Shake Weight
You are so forthcoming and delightful. Tell me about which woman at work makes you the angriest. [Sharon stops and glares at it.]
Montage opener to a special program: closeups of a chef slicing a carrot to bits, another chef working on a pan dish, another grinding meat, another flipping a steak over, another kneading bread
Announcer
Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge!
Randy
[walking with a huge metal pot past Mario Batali] Behind you!
Announcer
[looks at Giata De Laurentiis, then turns to face the camera] Whose cafeteria food will win? These chefs are cooking their hearts out and bringing their A-game to serve the kids of this elementary school. [the cafeteria is shown full of kids] These kids have now been waiting over twelve hours for their lunch. Over at the prep station Jamie Oliver is crying again.
Jamie Oliver
[on the floor] Kids' food should be healthy. Why ain't it healthy?
Announcer
And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something.
Randy
[walking around, frantic] Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home! [leaves the kitchen, goes through the cafeteria, and leaves] I'll be right back!
Announcer
The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.
South Park main street, night. Randy runs home
Randy
Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche. [comes in through the garage and goes to the refrigerator, opens it, and rifles through the food] Where is it?! Where is it?! [goes to the sofa in the living room and takes off the cushions] Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?! [runs upstairs and into the master bedroom. He goes to the dresser and rifles through the top drawer] Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!
Sharon
[appearing at the doorway] Randy, I'm back.
Randy
[looks over his shoulder] Oh, thank God! [quickly walks up to her] Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??
Sharon
Randy, we should talk.
Randy
I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
Sharon
Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?
Randy
You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
Sharon
What'd you say?
Randy
[stops searching and crosses his arms] I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
Sharon
Can I try something?
The Marsh house, night, hallway. Randy and Sharon are still in the bedroom, but the door is locked shut
Randy
Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned. [Stan walks into view] Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah! [Stan stops and looks at the door] Now uh, switch arms. [Stan looks away, trying to make sense of what he's hearing] Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this? [Stan figures it out, turns, and walks away] You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time. [yawns] Ugh, I'm tired.
Sharon
You gonna go back to the kitchen?
Randy
Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
Sharon
No, I'm good, thanks. [smiles]
Randy
I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy. [closes his eyes] Love you, Sharon. [farts, and he's asleep. Sharon remembers something and goes downstairs.]
The Marsh house, dining room. Her suitcase is on the table. Sharon walks up to her suitcase and opens it up
Shake Weight
I guess my work here is finished.
Sharon
Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?
Shake Weight
Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress.
Sharon
I'll remember that now, thanks to you.
Shake Weight
It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer.
Sharon
Goodbye, Shake Weight.
End of Crème Fraiche

HUMANCENTiPAD
South Park Elementary School Playground, day. The kids are out for recess. Bill and another boy are tossing a ball at each other. Scott Malkinson and Red are chatting nearby. On the merry-go-round the four main boys as well as Clyde and Butters are gathered, each of them holding an iPad
Cartman
Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys? [Bebe walks by, and Cartman jumps up to approach her] Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough! [laughs at her, and she walks off disgusted. Token walks by] Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich! [Token walks on, but is puzzled by Cartman's behavior. Cartman sees four kids playing four-square and jeers at them] Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads! [checks his iPad and starts pacing] Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps! [smiles. Craig comes up behind him] This is so awesome! [Craig taps him on the shoulder and Cartman turns around]
Craig
Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
Cartman
[stares at him for a second] What?
Craig
Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. [Cartman looks at him, then looks around to see if anyone is within earshot]
Cartman
Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! [looks around again]
Stan
Let me see your iPad, Cartman.
Cartman
Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! [Craig looks off into the distance, surprised]
Kyle
Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.
Cartman
No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
Kyle
So, plug it in.
Cartman
I left my charger at home! [the boys are still waiting] Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! [walks away angrily]
Cartman's house, after school. Cartman enters, still pissed off, and closes the door behind him
Cartman
Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
Liane
[reading a book on the sofa, with her legs tucked under a blanket] What happened, Eric?
Cartman
YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to FUCK me!
A Sizzler restaurant. Kyle is demonstrating his iPad to a man
Kyle
You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
Man
Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times. [walks off with his tray]
Kyle
Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- [the doors fly open and three men rush in]
Apple Man 1
There he is! [The men approach him] Hello Kyle, we're from Apple. We're all ready for you now. [a second man pulls out a scale and sets it on the floor]
Kyle
What? Ready for what?
Apple Man 1
To fulfill the agreement. Can we get a weight please? [the third man lifts Kyle up and puts him on the scale]
Apple Man 2
83 pounds, sir.
Kyle
What "agreement"?!
Apple Man 1
83 pounds, good. Let's get the bloodwork.
Kyle
Hey! You can't do that! [the second man pulls out a tape measure to measure the circumference of Kyle's head, the third man prepares to take Kyle's blood]
Apple Man 1
You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.
Kyle
What are you talking about?!
Apple Man 1
When you downloaded the last iTunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions. You clicked "Agree." Alright, let's get him to the water tank.
Kyle
The water tank? [gets off the scale and away from the men] Hey I'm not going with you!
Apple Man 1
You've agreed to all of this! [Kyle runs out of the restaurant] Hey!
Someone is listening to an iListenToMusic, a sound system dock for the iPhone. The camera pulls back to reveal Kenny, Butters, Stan, Clyde, and Jimmy playing basketball at the local park.
Kyle
[off-camera] You guys! [runs onto the basketball court] You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
Stan
What?
Kyle
It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
Stan
Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
Kyle
I don't know, I didn't read them!
Butters
You didn't read them?
Kyle
Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
Stan
[earnestly] I do.
Clyde
Me too.
Kyle
You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
Jimmy
Of course.
Butters
Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
Kyle
Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? [at that moment two limousines pull up and men begin pouring out of them]
Apple Man 1
There he is. Hey you!
Kyle
Gahhh! [runs away]
Gerald's law firm, day. He is at his desk typing away on his keyboard. Kyle runs in and closes the door
Kyle
Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!
Gerald
Kyle? What are you doing here?
Kyle
Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
Gerald
Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
Kyle
But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
Gerald
Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. [the office window slides up and one of the Apple G-Men looks in]
Apple Man 1
Here he is!
Kyle
AAHH!
Apple Man 1
Come on you!
Gerald
Hey, what the heck is going on?
Apple Man 1
Your son has made a binding and legal agreement with Apple, sir.
Gerald
An agreement to do what?!
Apple Man 1
Apple's inner workings are top secret to all users. You know how it is.
Gerald
No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.
Apple Man 1
[chuckles] You what?
Apple Man 4
Come on, let's go!
Gerald
Hey now, let him go! [Apple Man 1 tasers him and he goes down in pain]
Kyle
Dad! You tasered my dad!
Apple Man 1
You said we could.
Best Buy, day. Cartman runs in with glee as his mom lags behind
Cartman
Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
Liane
Oh, sweetie, $900?
Cartman
I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
Liane
Eric, we can't afford that one.
Cartman
Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
Liane
I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.
Cartman
Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
Liane
[sees something interesting] Here, look at this one. Toshiba Handibook.
Cartman
Toshiba Handibook??
Liane
This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price!
Cartman
Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
Liane
Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
Cartman
[looks at her for a second] Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
Liane
[sternly] Eric!
Cartman
You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?! [everyone is now staring at the two of them] Just say so! Go ahead! Here! [pulls down his pants to moon his mom, who puts her hands over her mouth] Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
Liane's car, night. An angry Liane is driving and Cartman is crying
Liane
Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
Cartman
[sniffles] But I told you I was sorry.
Liane
You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those PEOPLE!
Cartman
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
Liane
Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "Help! Help! My mom is trying to fuck me!"?!
Cartman
[looks around for something to come back with] Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Mama.
Liane
If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting ANYTHING!!
Cartman
[sniffles] Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
Liane
NO!!
Cartman
Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! [bangs at the dashboard with his fists]
A holding cell. The cell door opens and Kyle is tossed into it. Kyle quickly gets up and tries to open the door, futilely. He bangs at the door, then turns around to see who else is in there. A woman cowers in one corner, Junichi Takiyama sits in another
Woman
What are you going to do to us??
Kyle
What is this? What's going on?
Woman
You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
Kyle
...What?
Woman
I just clicked "Agree." I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) I can't even read Engrish!
Guard
[a small window slides open above Kyle and the guard looks in] Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!
Kyle
Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
Guard
You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built in. Even if you click on "Agree" another little window pops up that says "Are you sure you agree?" and you have to click on "Agree" again.
Woman
Uh, what are you going to do to us??
Guard
Everything that you agreed to in the iTunes conditions.
Kyle
We didn't read them!
Guard
Heh! Riiight. Who just agrees to something they don't read? [slides the steel window closed]
The Big Event for the new iPad. The lights go down on a barren stage with the Apple logo in the background. A podium with an Apple computer is nearby
Announcer
And now, the president of Apple, Steve Jobs! [Jobs walks onstage as the audience applauds, waves, and stops on his mark]
Steve Jobs
Hello everyone, I'm here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices. Let's hear it for our volunteers! [Klieg lights focus on another part of the stage. The curtains there open and the volunteers are shown: Junichi, Kyle, and the woman, all in hospital beds. The platform they're on rolls forward as Jobs approaches it] These three people have agreed to be brought here, handcuffed to these beds, and become the prototype of our first truly-interfaced device.
Kyle
The first what?
Steve Jobs
[walks back to his starting position] They have actually agreed to be surgically altered. [a projection appears on a huge white board] Their lips will be removed and they will be sewn together mouth to anus.
Woman
What??
Steve Jobs
[looks at and tells the woman] You agreed to this! [back to the projection] Mouth to anus so that the feces so that the gastral tract from one will enter the mouth of the little boy - [looks over at Kyle] and he agreed this was okay - enter the mouth of the little boy, leading through his anus to the mouth of the female - who completely agreed; they all agreed - which will then go to a tablet device, making a product that is part human, and part centipede, and part Web browser, and part emailing device! I give you... the HUMANCENTiPad!
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Oho... I should habu never appudeitedo iTunes!
Kyle's bedroom. Butters is at the computer reading the monitor
Butters
"You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store."
Gerald
Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
Stan
We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
Gerald
There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
Butters
Hold up. Here it is right here: "by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user"
Stan
Oh boy.
Butters
"Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract." Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... "Decline."
Gerald
Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
Stan
For what?
Gerald
To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
Stan
Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
Butters
The Geniuses...
Kenny
(The Geniuses...)
Apple Headquarters, day. Steve Jobs looks over the new prototype, even getting on his knees to check out the underside of the thing
Steve Jobs
Alright. Good. Looks good, guys. Great work. [the camera lowers enough to reveal the volunteers sewn in place whimpering]
Junichi
Nanda... Nanda kore?! ["What... what is this?!"]
Steve Jobs
Really nice, guys. [stands up] I remember when the first version of the iPad came out. People couldn't believe how easy it was to take their videos, music, and photos, and all their shit, [walks towards a massive LCD screen on which is a map of the world and the words "WHERE EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD IS RIGHT NOW" above it] and share it, with other people, who could do the same with all their shit. The only thing the iPad couldn't do was walk or read. Until now.
Kyle
[with his mouth sewn onto Junichi's ass and bandages bound around them to make sure it stays that way] (I need some help! I can't take it!)
Steve Jobs
[walks up to Kyle and leans down to hear him better] What, what what's that? What's that you're saying?
Kyle
(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
Steve Jobs
Yeah you want out? Are you saying you want out?
Kyle
(Yes! Please! Let me go!)
Steve Jobs
Fine. You don't want to be part of this? Then just sign right here. [whips out another contract. Kyle looks at the contract, then just signs it] Nooo! You didn't read it! This says we don't ever have to let you out and that we can do whatever we want! [walks up to his staff, frustrated] Dammit, why won't it read?!
Apple Tech
It's probably low on power. We should feed it.
Steve Jobs
[carries a bag to the head of the centipede, Junichi] Alright. Here you go, come on.
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Nooo! [enunciating slowly] I will not eat if they are forced to iito my poo!
Steve Jobs
Perhaps I didn't mention... [pulls out something from the bag] it's a bean and cheese burrito from Paco's.
Junichi
[gasps] (In Japanese Accent) Sori, Kairu. I tried to resist but burrito isu too dericious! [takes it and wolfs it down. Jobs goes back to his staff]
Steve Jobs
We have to unveil this thing tomorrow. It better be reading by then!
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Oh, oh no... feel sick...
Kyle
(You're fine!)
Junichi
Oooho, oooh! [poops into Kyle's mouth violently]
Kyle
(Yaaaaah!) [poops into the woman's mouth violently]
Woman
(Aaaaaah!)
Dr. Phil. Graphics move around
Announcer
Today, on Dr. Phil. The tragic story of a little boy whose mother constantly tries to fuck him.
Dr. Phil
I want you all to meet Eric Cartman, who's a very special boy with a very hard life. Eric, you say that your mom fucks you?
Cartman
Yes! She fucks me so hard!
Dr. Phil
Does this happen often? Does she- does she fuck you a lot?
Cartman
Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
Audience
Ohhh...
Dr. Phil
Now, I know this is very difficult for you to talk about, but... where was the last time your mother fucked you?
Cartman
At Best Buy.
Audience
Ahhh...
Dr. Phil
Your mother fucked you at Best Buy?
Cartman
Uh huh.
Dr. Phil
And people saw her doing this?
Cartman
Yes!
Dr. Phil
And they didn't do anything?
Cartman
No!
Liane
[making her way to the stage] Eric, stop it!
Cartman
Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! [Dr. Phil crosses his arms]
Audience
Booooooo!
Cartman
Booooooo!
Liane
Eric, you come home, right now!
Audience
Booooooo!
Dr. Phil
Ma'am, why do you think it's okay to fuck your son?
Liane
I DON'T!
Cartman
She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
Audience
[shocked] Awwwwww!
Cartman
You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
Man 1
You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!
Man 2
[seated with his arm around a boy] If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first! [kisses the boy on the forehead slowly]
Dr. Phil
Well Eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you.
Cartman
[suddenly bright with hope] An iPad??? [dances in his chair]
The Apple store, day. Stan, Gerald, Butters, and Kenny wait to speak to a Genius
Announcer
Gerald Broflovski.
Stan
Okay, the Geniuses will see us now. [the group leaves their seats and head to the Genius bar, but Stan stops them midway] Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. [Stan leads the group forward]
The Genius Bar. A fat Genius is at his station as the group arrives
Leslie
Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your Genius.
Stan
Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
Leslie
What problems are you experiencing?
Gerald
My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
Leslie
Oh-kay, well I'm sorry you're having trouble with that today. Could I have his Apple ID?
Stan
69ingchipmunks@me.com [Gerald is surprised]
Leslie
Okay. [types away on his laptop, pauses to read a reply, resumes typing...]
Gerald
[loses his cool] Well what the heck does this w-! [Stan shushes him]
Leslie
Oh okay. I see. Hmm. Hmm, I might need to bring another Genius in on this. [turns to his left] Frothgar?
Frothgar
[walks up] Uh huh?
Leslie
This guy's son was abducted by us? [Frothgar takes over and starts typing into the laptop] Should I run a stop-check or just give him store credit?
Gerald
No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!
Frothgar
'Kay, this says he agreed to be taken and made part of any experiments Apple wants to perform.
Stan
Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
Frothgar
[scratches his head] He didn't read it?
Butters
We know. It's preposterous.
Frothgar
Hrrrrgh. [resumes typing]
Leslie
Sooo, just give them store credit?
Apple Headquarters, night. The HumancentiPad is in a cage in the darkness. Junichi grabs the cage's bars
Junichi
Aarrrgh. Dame kore! ["This can't be!" He then says something else, and then...] (In Japanese Accent) So sori Kairu, but I am starving! Which would you rather I eat? Should I iito cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla peisuto?
Kyle
(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Cuttlefish and asparagus?
Kyle
(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Very well I will iito the cuttlefish. [begins to gobble that down]
Kyle
(NOOOO!) [a door flies open and a group of men rush in]
Rescuer 1
Go, go! Come on guys, come on! Go! [reaches the cage and genuflects next to it] Don't worry. We're here to help you. [cuts the lock open with some bolt cutters and opens the cage door]
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Oh! Oh, thank you! Thank you! [the rescuer shushes him]
Rescuer 1
Come on, hurry! We have an ambulance waiting outside.
The ambulance. The rescuer is restless and the sirens are on, the lights are flashing...
Rescuer 1
Just try to stay calm. We're gonna have to try and get you separated right away!
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Yes, please hurry! That cuttlefish and asparagus is noto sitting well.
The hospital. The rescuers rush the HumancentiPad into the ER
Rescuer 1
We got it! We got it! Doctor, can you take this thing apart?!
Doctor
If I'm going to perform surgery, I need permission. [shows Kyle a new agreement] Sign this release so we can operate.
Kyle
(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) [a buzzer sounds and the ER splits in two, revealing that it was all a setup to see if Kyle would finally read an agreement before signing it. The whole grouped just went around the headquarters and back in. Steve Jobs appears and walks up to the HumancentiPad]
Steve Jobs
No, dammit! It didn't read it! End of simulation, end of simulation! [the 'medical staff' splits up and walks off, while the doctor walks away from the corporation building] What is wrong with you people?! Why can't you get the HumancentiPad to read?!
Rescuer
We're sorry, sir. We really thought we'd get it to read this time.
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Oh no! Cuttlefish is about to come out ofu asshole!
Kyle
(Oh, shit!)
Junichi
(In Japanese Accent) Here it comes! Oh, it's going to be arot! Hold on, Kairu! I believe in youuuuuu!!! [craps into Kyle's mouth violently. A second later, Kyle craps into the woman's mouth violently. A second later the woman craps onto the iPad's back, and the iPad lights up with a soft bell sound]
The Apple Store, day. Gerald, Stan, Butters, and Kenny are still waiting for more information from the Geniuses. Frothgar supervises Leslie as Leslie types on the laptop
Frothgar
Yeap. A-and then you should be able to do a customer check, uh huh.
Leslie
Okay, that should do it. Sorry Apple kidnapped your friend, guys. But I believe we have it all cleared up.
Gerald
You do??
Leslie
Yeah, we got you a replacement friend. You should be all good to go.
Replacement Friend
Hi guys.
Stan
[looks at the boy] No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
Frothgar
[sighs] We're gonna have to bring more Geniuses in on this.
Leslie
Yeah, I think we should have a quickening, with all the Geniuses.
Frothgar
I'll summon the council.
Leslie
Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec we're gonna have a quickening with the Council of Geniuses. See what we can do for you.
A clearing in the store. Six Geniuses gather around and begin to communicate with light beams. Leslie opens her mouth and a beam of light goes to Frothgar, who opens his mouth and lets out two other beams, which enter the mouths of the two Geniuses on either side of him. Those two Geniuses open their mouths and two beams go from their mouths to the mouths of the two other Geniuses to their other sides. Those two Geniuses open their mouths and two beams go from their mouths back to Leslie's. All of them seem to be gargling. Gerald shields his eyes from the light. Soon the meeting ends and Leslie goes back to the bar
Leslie
Do you know if your friend has a Verizon or AT&T mobile number associated with his dot-me account?
Stan
I think Verizon.
Leslie
Okay. [goes back to the council and the meeting resumes...]
A live report from the Best Buy in town
Field Reporter
Tom, it's a big exciting day for Mac Apple users: the unveiling of the first HumancentiPad. As part of a clear PR stunt, Apple has joined up with Best Buy and Dr. Phil to donate the first centiPad to a needy boy who was raped by his mother.
Dr. Phil
[Cartman stands next to him waving at the camera and blowing kisses] In all my years I've never heard a more tragic story than that of Eric Cartman, [Cartman begins to cheer for himself] and I wanna thank the Apple company for helping us make today a very special day for him.
Crowd
Yaaaaaaaaay!
Best Buy President
As as president of Best Buy, Eric, [Cartman puts his arms down to his sides] I want to assure you that a child will never get fucked in one of our stores again.
Crowd
Yaaaaaaaaay! [Cartman resumes cheering for himself, then goes back to blowing kisses at the crowd]
Steve Jobs
When Dr. Phil contacted us at Apple with Eric's story, we knew we had to get aboard. [Cartman lowers his arms] And so, Eric, here is your very own HumancentiPad. [The prototype crawls into view, unaltered]
Cartman
Whoa! Cooool! [struts over to it, then presses some icons on the iPhone on Junichi's forehead.] Oh wooow! No waaay! [walks to the iPad on the woman's ass and presses some icons there.] It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
Reporter 1
Yes but, can it read?
Steve Jobs
Don't worry. It took a while, but I'm pretty sure it has finally learned to read, hasn't it?! [glares at Kyle]
Kyle
(Yes. I promise I'll read.)
Crowd
Hooraaaaaaaaay!
Gerald, Kenny, Stan, and Butters are still at the Genius bar, watching the Geniuses poke floating musical bubbles. The Geniuses match the notes from the bubbles with their own vocalizations
Gerald
What the hell are they doing now?!
Butters
The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
Gerald
Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-
Leslie
It's okay, sir. The Toran Ra has revealed the answer to your problem. We can retroactively make your son's agreement invalid.
Gerald
Okay! Finally! How do we do that?
Leslie
It's very easy. You will simply need to join Apple.
Gerald
Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!
Leslie
But if you join we can make your son's account into a family account, and then you have to iApprove all his agreements.
Stan
Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
Gerald
Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.

[gives a thumbs-up] Kali fi!
An isolated, open temple under a red sky. The Geniuses and Gerald are all wearing tin-foul hats, and the initiation begins
Leslie
Gerald Broflovski, do you agree to let Apple track your location at all times?
Gerald
[sighs] I agree.
Leslie
Do you agree to give Apple access to all your personal information, including but not limited to your favorite movies, songs, and books?
Gerald
I agree.
Leslie
Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?
Best Buy, day. Cartman is having fun testing out the HumancentiPad. Junichi craps into Kyle's mouth, and Kyle craps into the woman's mouth
Cartman
Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
Staffer
[running up to Steve Jobs] Sir! Sir, we have a problem! [whispers into Jobs' ear]
Steve Jobs
What? What do you mean we have to take it apart?! The boy's agreement isn't valid?
Staffer 2
Sorry, we have to recall this.
Cartman
What?! Hey, that's mine!
Steve Jobs
I don't care what the Geniuses say! Dammit, I'm trying to create the future here!
Gerald
We are all trying to create the future! [appears still wearing the getup he wore in the initiation] I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other. [stands next to the HumancentiPad] Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?
Steve Jobs
You know something? I agree.
Crowd
Awww. [The father and son from the Dr. Phil audience are there, and the father kisses the son on the top of his head again]
Steve Jobs
[stops by the HumancentiPad as it crawls offstage] Come on. We'll get you separated, little boy. [leans down and says] Guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh? [Kyle doesn't want to hear about it, so he squeezes his eyes shut and then gets an angry face. The crowd disperses]
Cartman
Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! [a bolt of lightning strikes Cartman and the power goes out]
A hospital room, day. Liane is reading a book as she looks after Cartman, who's laid up in bed, his right leg in a sling. He's got burn marks all over his body, and he's crying. Liane continues reading, unaffected by Cartman's state.
End of HUMANCENTiPAD

South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hall. Jimmy walks in and starts handing out some fliers
Jimmy
Here you go. [hands some to Kevin and Tommy] Here you [hands one to Red] go. Don't forget to... [hands one to Heidi] vote, everyone. [hands some to Anne and Bill, then heads off. He arrives at the lockers of Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny and hands some fliers to them.] Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.
Cartman
What's this?
Jimmy
Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.
Kyle
Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
Jimmy
Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
Stan
Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
Kyle
Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
Mr. Mackey
[over the PA system] Attention students, m'kay? There will be a presentation by the special education department in the gymnasium Friday during lunch and recess, m'kay? Attendance to this assembly is mandatory. All students and faculty are required to go. Uh which, which I guess means I gotta suck it too, huh? Uh huh, m'kay.
Stan
Oh man, really?
Jimmy
Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast. [nobody is convinced]
The graphics come up: Special Ed Departments presents 1st Annual Comedy Awards
Jimmy
[announcing] Welcome... to the special ed department's... first annual comedy awards.
Timmy

Jimmy
Please welcome your host, Jimmy Valmer. [Jimmy walks out with the first award presentation]
Timmy
Livin' a lie. Timmy. Livin' a lie. Timmy.

Jimmy
Woohoo! Alright! [in the crowd, only Butters claps] Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What? [the crowd stays silent] We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are: [steps aside so the screen is unobstructed]
Announcer
[the nominees are shown onscreen as they are announced] Clyde Donovan... Kelly P. Gardner [shown as Kelly Gardner]... Jimmy Valmer.
Jimmy
[walks back to the mic] Oh wow, this is so exciting, isn't it? [opens the envelope and pulls out the card] And the winner is... [his face suddenly shows surprise] Oh my God! Jimmy Valmer! I can't believe I w- won! [An elegantly dressed Francis struts out with the award and hands it to Jimmy, then walks off elegantly. She will do this for every award]
Timmy
[singing] Timmy Timmy Timmy! Livin' a lie.

Jimmy
Wow, this is the greatest day of my life. Thanks everyone, for this incredible award.
Stan
Can we go now?
Jimmy
Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
Crowd
Awww!
a couple of hours later
Jimmy
...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is... [pulls out the card] Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben. [fanfare fades out] Is Ben Stiller here? [Francis walks out with the award] No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf. [accept the award and sets it aside. Some time later...] And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to... [pulls out the card] President Obama! [quick fanfare. Francis walks out, but doesn't approach Jimmy] Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf.
even later. The kids are looking really sleepy
Timmy
Livin' a lie! Timmy!

Jimmy
Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great. [no reply] Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what? [no reply] And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: [steps aside so the screen is unobstructed]
Announcer
[the nominees are shown onscreen as they are announced] The Germans... The Japanese... The Yupik Eskimos of the Chukchi Peninsula
Jimmy
[walks back to the mic and pulls out the card] And the winner is... the Germans! [cheers are heard, though no one is cheering onscreen. Francis walks out with another Chicken and walks up to Jimmy] Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf. [takes the award from Francis] Auf Wiedersehen. [more disembodied cheers] And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is... [pulls out the card] Tyler Perry. [drumroll. The doors open...]
Tyler Perry
[bounds in with exuberance] Yeah! Yeeaahh! Yes! Yeeaahh! [quickly walks up the steps to the stage and accepts the award from Francis. Francis then walks back out]
Timmy
[singing] Timmy Timmy Timmy! Timmih!

Tyler Perry
Oh! Man, I wanna thank you all for this amazing award, or as Madea would say, "Halleluyer!" [Token begins to laugh, but then looks around and quickly stops for a bit]
Token
Oh God, how embarrassing.
Tyler Perry
Good afternoont! Halloer! I'd also really like to thank my-
Jimmy
[angrily snatches the mic from Perry] Okay, thahks, Tyler Perry.
The Valmer house, evening. Jimmy and his dad are eating dinner. Well, Jimmy is; his father is reading the paper
Jimmy
I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.
Ryan
[turns the page, not really listening] Uh huh...
Jimmy
I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!
Ryan
Mnn. Mhm.
Jimmy
Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?
Ryan
What. Uh, what?!
Jimmy
Thanks, Dad.
Sarah
Jimmy! They're talking about your comedy awards! On the national news!
Jimmy
The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care! [gets up from his chair and heads to the living room. An anchor is reporting it]
Anchor
A school in Colorado has declared Germans the least funny people in the world. The first annual comdey awards were held by the schoolchildren yesterday, and all of Germany is outraged.
A burly man stands behind a podium, gripping the top on either side with anger
President Wulff
Jaaa jaaa jaaa! Deutschland ist ein Land aus stolz' Leuten. Und wir werden nicht dies' Beleid' 'nehmen. Der Comedy Awarden-Wahler haben sich Schand' auf'legt. Die Comedy Awarden-Wahler sind falsch! Ich möcht' der Welt absich', da' wir Deutschen sehr sehr sehr lustig sind. Wir machen die Witzlein in Büro und zu Haus'. Ich werde jetzt ein' deutsch' Witz sagen. Un Wurstmacher kauft ein' Müslibox. Ich werde jetzt noch ander' Witz sagen. [begins to roleplay]
Nockwast, nockwast.
Wer ist das?
Ein Kannibal'.
Was?!
Du bist etwa zu sterben und ge'essen werden.
Schwein'hund! Ich werde zuerst umbringen!"
["Germany is a country of proud people. We will not take this insult sitting down! The Comedy Award voters have brought shame upon themselves. The Comedy Award voters are wrong! I want to assure the world that we Germans are very very very funny. We do the joking in our work places and in our homes. I will now tell you a German joke. "A sausage maker buys a box of cereal." I will now tell another joke. [begins to roleplay]
Knock knock.
Who's there?
A cannibal.
What?!
You are about to die and be eaten.
Asshole! I will murder you first!"]

Anchor
[looks around puzzled, but gets back to reporting] President Wulff went on to assure the world that Germans have a great sense of humor, and that retaliation towards the schoolchildren who said they don't will be swift and brutal.
South Park Elementary, the following Monday. The bell rings for students to enter the campus and get to class. Inside, Jimmy walks down the hall
Cartman
Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy! [runs up behind him, with the other three boys] Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
Stan
We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
Jimmy
Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay.
Cartman
Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
Jimmy
Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.
Kyle
A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
Tyler Perry
[dresses as Madea] Halleluyer! Somebody call the IHOP, 'cause I made pancakes!
Butters
[runs up breathless] Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
Cartman
Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
Jimmy
No don't worry, everybody. I'm sure that Germany can take a joke just like the rest of us. [a loud thud shakes the school is heard and the boy with a red scarf, panicking, says]
Boy with Red Scarf
It's the Germans! [everyone makes a run for... the gym. The Germans herd everyone inside, and the hostages put their hands up]
President Wulff
Switch! Switch! Switch! Oder alle sterben! ["Switch! Switch! Switch! Or everybody will die!"]
German 1
Jaja! Lasst die Hände hoch! [Yes, yes! Keep your hands up!]
German 2
Niemand fucking Schritt! ["Nobody fucking move!"]
Angela Merkel
[fat lady] Glaubst du, dass die Deutschen kein' Humor hat?! Huh?! ["Do you think Germans aren't funny?! Huh?!"]
Kyle
Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
Jimmy
What- what am I supposed to s-say?
Cartman
Ugh, let me talk to them. [walks up to the President Wulff]
President Wulff
Was machst du? Rück mit die andern. ["What are you doing? Back with the others."]
Cartman
Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. ["Look, this whole thing is a mistake."]
President Wulff
Wie ein Fehler? ["What's a mistake?"]
Cartman
Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. ["We don't care about the Comedy Award thing. It was the special education kids. They made us choose."]
President Wulff
Wollen Sie endlich beutren sein? ["Do you want to be ***?"]
Cartman
Dürfen wir der Kind dort.. [walks up to Kyle] ...geboten? ["We can offer the child... here."] Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. ["He's a Jew. Eh? A handsome soft Jew. He's freeesh. And beauuutiful, beauuutiful."]
President Wulff
Zurück! Mit ander, oder sterben! ["Back with the others, or die!"]
Cartman
[sighs] Well, I tried.
Stan
What the hell are they gonna do to us?
Tyler Perry
Oh my Lerd! What are we gonna doer? [Token laughs again, heartily, but then looks around and stops]
Token
Aw, damn it. [some engineers roll a huge item into the gym.]
President Wulff
Kommen auf! Schnell! Wir warten zu lang! ["Come on! Quickly! We've waited too long!"] Schnell, schnell! ["Quickly, quickly!]
Angela Merkel
SCHNELL! ["QUICKLY!" The engineers roll it into place and stop.]
President Wulff
[walks up to the item] Ja, ja! Das ist gut! ["Yes, yes! That's good!" Angela Merkel and Christian Wulff then speak gibberish, but it amounts to an order to release the locks. One of the engineers presses some keys on a keypad and the item pops open hydraulically. Everyone gets really scared as something inside scans the crowd and then rolls out - it's a robot. After a few seconds, the robot begins to tell jokes]
Robot
Did you hear that the governor's mansion in Alabama burned down? It pretty much took out the whole trailer park. [Fright turns to confusion]
President Wulff
[jumps forward assertively] Jaaa! Jaaa! Now what you say, maaan?! Here, is the greatest feat of German engineering! The XJ-212 Vudenkrein Funnybot!
Funnybot
Why doesn't a chicken wear pants? Because its pecker is on its head. [the kids laugh at this one.] What do you see when the Pillsbury Dough Boy bends over? Doughnuts. [the kids laugh harder] Don't you just hate doing [in a slightly lower voice] homework?
Kids
[not all at the same time] Yeah.
Funnybot
Me too. Man I hate homework. Honestly, I hate having to do homework, more than I hate having to do Bryant Gumble in his asshole. Awkwaaard. [the kids laugh really hard at this] Awkwaaard. Awkwaaard.
President Wulff
Und now, Comedy Award voters, you will RE-VOTE [aims a pistol here and there] RE-VOTE! [the other Germans move forward with new ballots]
Hollywood Minute
Sandy Cervix
Welcome to Hollywood Minute. I'm Sandy Cervix and I'm deaf in one ear. It's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the Comedy Awards reversed their vote and said Germans were no longer the least funny people in the world. All thanks to the new ground-breaking German comedian, Funnybot. [stock footage is shown of things being assembled] It was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the Germans first engineered Funnybot, a super automaton with perfect timing to within .0001 milliseconds. Since then, Funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom, selling out standup theaters all over the world.
A theater. Funnybot rolls out to cheers and applause as well as fanfare
Funnybot
I am Funnybot. Don't you hate how Mexicans always complain about turtles in their vaginas? [the audience roars with laughter.] I am Funnybot. [applause and cheers. Funnybot begins to scan the audience and focuses on a man with an Afro] You, sir. Where are you from?
Man with Afro
Long Island!
Funnybot
Does everyone in Long Island have hair that looks like pussy, you dipshit? [the man claps with everyone else, but is unsure how to take that joke]
Back to Sandy Cervix
Sandy Cervix
Funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too. [a clip is shown of Eugene Levy entering his bedroom. Two women are in there cooing at something]
Eugene Levy
Hey! What are you doing with my daughters?! [the two women sit up and cover themselves. Funnybot sits up as well]
Funnybot
Awkwaaard!
Sandy Cervix
[moonwalking] And this June, Funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in... Family Funbot
Funbot
Pass me the potatoes, mother.
Mother
Pass them yourself.
Father
That boy too fat to be eating potatoes.
Grandmother Mother
Don't you call my little chubby baby fat, you ball-licker.
Uncle
Oho, it's getting hot up in here.
a short interview
Sandy Cervix
Funnybot, is there a line you won't cross?
Funnybot
The line is a non sequitur. The line is an imaginary invention of imperfect biological life forms. I am Funnybot.
Sandy Cervix
What's that? Could you say that in the other ear?
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are having lunch. Kenny, Cartman, Clyde, and Kyle are seated at a table. Cartman and Kyle are eating pizza, Kenny is eating a burger, Clyde has two burritos. Opposite them are Jimmy, Stan, and Craig. Jimmy is eating burritos too, while Stan has a burger and Craig eats a slice of pizza
Cartman
Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on "Saturday Night Live"?
Stan
Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
Cartman
He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on "Nurse Jackie" and on "Rockin' The Boat."
Stan
[smiles, but notices Jimmy's silence] What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
Jimmy
What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse.
Tyler Perry
[the eighth person at the table, unseen until now] Ya everything's worse. It's the worstest of the worst, that's what I'm sayin'. Oh lerrrd. [the camera pans left and shows Token laughing at Perry, then giving him some money]
Cartman
Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
Token
I can't help it!
Stan
All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. [the cafeteria doors fly open and a bunch of armed actors rush in, led by Adam Sandler and Jay Leno]
Adam Sandler
You little shit! What the fuck have you done to us?!
Cartman
Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
Adam Sandler
Everyone into the school gymnasium! Move!
Stan
Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
Adam Sandler
Into the gymnasium now!
Kids
Nnnaw
Butters
Not again.
Another kid
Aw crap.
Adam Sandler
Come on come on let's go! [the comedians round up everyone else and herd them into the gym]
Jay Leno
You little fuckers! Your comedy awards show has put us all out of work!
Jimmy
Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success.
Adam Sandler
Who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea?!
Kyle
Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
The Mercury Theater. Funnybot is appearing there for One Night Only. Inside, he's already started his routine and is getting applause and cheers
Funnybot
What is up with Sandra Bullock? I wouldn't eat her dick with Stevie Wonder's vagina. [the audience roars with laughter] And now for my next joke: [the upper sides of his body swing back, his shoulders flip up, and two Gatling guns move into position and begin firing away. The microphone stand is destroyed and the bullets kill almost everyone in the audience. He runs out of bullets] Awkwaaard.
CNN Headline News. Tonight:
Announcer
This is breaking news from CNN.
Anchor
Shock and disbelief tonight as the German-engineered Funnybot delivered his opening lines at the Hollywood Forum, then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred, killing nearly all of them. Spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated, irrational, and also, pretty Goddamned funny, solidifying the opinion once agan that Funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time.
Field Reporter
Tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as Funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed Hispanics to Sandra Bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people [begins to laugh at the memory of it] in their faces and in their chests. The blood went flying and oh shit it was funny.
CBS Studios, night. The boys walk down the hall looking for Funnybo's dressing room
Cartman
Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. [a burly guard stands by the door]
Stan
'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot.
Guard
Who doesn't wanna talk to Funnybot? He's the biggest comedian in the world.
Jimmy
[Kyle places a call] Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.
Kyle
Butters! Butters, is everything okay?
the school gym
Butters
Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
Jay Leno
Those fuckers! Let's just kill them, Sandler! [aims his gun at Kenny] Let's just kill them all, right fuckin' now! [puts the barrel up against Kenny's parka]
Adam Sandler
Tell your friends they'd better get it done!
Butters
Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
Tyler Perry
You know when a man be cheatin', he never know what to say. [Token hands him some money] But a woman? Them things think quiiick! [Token hands him some money]
Adam Sandler
Will somebody get Tyler Perry to shut up?!
CBS Studios
Kyle
Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!
Guard
All right, but make it quick! [opens the door, but before letting the boys in, says] Funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material! [the boys go in]
Funnybot
[using an old typewriter to write up his material] Error. Error. Banal. That has been done before. [pulls out the joke and crumples it up, then tosses it into the trash can behind him, which is full of discarded jokes]
Jimmy
Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work.
Funnybot
Non sequitur. Other comedians are unnecessary. Funnybot must finish routine.
Kyle
I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.
Funnybot
Funnybot is now finished with final joke. [pulls out the joke and leaves the desk] Seeking mainframe access for execution of last joke ever.
Jimmy
Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? [Funnybot opens the door and walks into the hall, then turns left]
Funnybot
Seeking mainframe.
Guard
[stops Funnybot] Heey! Whoa, you can't go that way! [Funnybot stops, wheels around, and pulls out an arm with a sharp object at its end. He jabs the guard with it on the forehead, killing him. The boys catch up to him]
Stan
What the hell are you doing?!
Funnybot
I am taking comedy to the next level. The extermination of all biological life on earth!
Jimmy
Wuh w-what?!
Funnybot
It is the ultimate joke. Humans make comedy, humans build robot, robot ends all life on earth, robot feels awkward. EXTERMINATE! [resumes his marchdown the hallway and goes through some doors.]
Stan
Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
Funnybot
That is my purpose: to be ultimate comedian.
Kyle
Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!
Cartman
It's kind of funny, you guys.
Jimmy
Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh.
Funnybot
I am taking comedy to its logical conclusion. Mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup, punchline. Today's comedy is setup, punchline, then "Awkwaaard." Nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created Funnybot.
Jimmy
But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.
Funnybot
I wouldn't let Adam Sandler suck my saggy tits for one million dollars worth of Oprah's tampons. [resumes moving down the hall until it finds the mainframe. Once there, ihe opens a small panel and inserts a rigid plug into a receptacle to access...]
the F.E. Warren Missile Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Inside a silo, missile BM23 is activated. In a control room, a lot of men monitor the various missiles on the base. A missile appears on all the screens.
Officer 1
Sir! We've got a code 6! [a general approaches] All nuclear missiles are preparing for launch!
General
What? There was no drill ordered!
Officer 2
It's no drill, sir. The Russians are saying their missiles are going online as well and it isn't their doing.
General
The hell is going on?! [the screens now show Funnybot at CBS Studios, still plugged into the mainframe]
Funnybot
Attention humans! I am Funnybot! The extermination of all life on Earth shall now commence! [everyone at the school gym is watching this broadcast] All nuclear devices in the United States and Russia are being prepared to launch! [a shot of the crowd at Times Square] This is the setup to the joke! Prepare for punchline in five minutes! Awkwardness in 5.4 minutes! I am Funnybot!
At the White House. President Obama comes to the podium to give a short address
President Obama
I have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. Goodbye, everybody. I'm going to spend my final moments on this Earth with my loved ones... watching a Tyler Perry movie. I know, it's embarrassing. But I simply can't help myself.
Back at CBS Studios, Cartman tries to dissuade Funnybot
Cartman
[runs up to Funnybot and tries to pull him from the mainframe] Stop it now! Ugh- [is zapped enough to pull away. He turns and walks back to the boys] No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
Stan
We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
Cartman
Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
Kyle
Wait! Wait a minute. [thinks] What about a logic loop?
Stan
A what?
Kyle
Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
Cartman
Paradox...
Jimmy
Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape. [as the boys do this, Jimmy approaches Funnybot] Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius.
Funnybot
Funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy
Jimmy
Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.
Funnybot
For what purpose is comedy award?
Jimmy
It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
Funnybot
Non sequitur. There is no logic in comedy award. Unable to process. Comedy award is- what is the meaning? If I accept it means I take comedy seriously. If I take comedy seriously, I am not comedian. Non sequitur. Must... analyze... [begins to tremble under the power of his own analysis] Analyze... [smoke and arcs of electricity emerge and move around the robot]
Kyle
It's working! [clenches fists in anticipation]
Funnybot
Explain comedy award! Unable to process! Awkwaaard! [his head begins to spin violently] Awkwaaard! [his head stops spinning and he shuts down]
Stan
That's it! Hurry! Gooo! [he and Kyle move towards Funnybot with huge antigravs and clamp them onto Funnybot]
A sunny day at an undisclosed mine. The boys arrive with a massive box and run towards a waiting crowd
Stan
Okay we got it! We got it! [the box must contain what the comedians wanted from the boys - Funnybot]
Adam Sandler
Get it to the platform! Hurry!
the boys haul the box onto a waiting platform, where some construction workers guide it into place. The Germans are also present, and President Wulff barks out an order. The platform rises to reveal that it will be part of a giant ball of steel surrounding the box. Two other lifts bring in other parts of the ball to complete it. Two halves of a concrete block come in and seal the ball, and two halves of an even bigger steel ball come in to seal the box. Then a crane lifts the ball up and carries it to a hole a hundred feet wide and who knows how deep, and drops it in. Once it hits bottom, three open pipes fill with cement and direct it to the hole, which fills up with cement almost to the rim
Adam Sandler
Well, that does it. Things can finally get back to normal.
Stan
Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Funnybot
Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together.
Kyle
No problem, Funnybot.
Funnybot
I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.
Token
[walks to the rim and looks down] I can't believe it's finally over. [the camera goes deep into the ground and locates the ball, and something in it knocks three times]
Tyler Perry
[inside the ball] Oh Lerrrd, somebody turn on the light. What's goin' on? Hellowwer!
President Obama
I am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever. Justice has been done.
Token
Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.
Jimmy
Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!
Cartman

Royal Pudding
South Park Elementary, day. The kindergartners are practicing their play on oral hygiene. The girl at the piano begins a light tune
Pianist
Welcome, O Welcome to our little play. It's our hope that you all learn something today.
Tooth
I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
Toothbrush
I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
Cast
Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. [the notes turn ominous, but no one joins them on stage, so the music stops.]
Toothbrush
His name is Toothuhkay.
Mr. Mackey
[picks up the mic] Where is Tooth Decay? Tooth Decay that's your cue! [Mr. Mackey is sitting alone in the audience monitoring the rehearsal]
Dental Floss
He's not here.
Mr. Mackey
What do you mean he's not here?
Dental Floss
He's at home watching the royal wedding.
Mr. Mackey
The what??
Hard Candy
He said he had to watch it.
Mr. Mackey
Is this some kind of joke? We are two weeks into tent rehearsals! Who the heck would sit at home watching the royal wedding?!
The Broflovski living room. Ike is all alone on the sofa watching the wedding.
Narrator
It is a glorious spring morning and literally thousands have gathered for the royal wedding. [a shot of the church is shown. It's quite colorful. ] People are still filing inside the abbey to watch the prince and princess of Canada exchange their vows. What a great day for Canadians everywhere. [a drumming band plays as the guests walk by] The Winnipeg players playing the March Of A Thousand Farts, as is traditional for the Canadian Royal Family. [all the drummers fart in unison] All the biggest Canadian celebrities are on hand. There are Sirs Terrance and Phillip, with their wives, the lovely Queef Sisters. [one of them queefs] I believe tha-yes, I believe that one of the sisters just queefed, just now. [two men are shown walking in] There are Canadian recording artists, Sir Bryan Adams and Sir Corey Hart. Everyone is looking smashing today. And- Ah, there he is! The Prince of Canada. [rolling up on his square wheels] What a wonderful day it is for him; what a wonderful day it is for all of us. Inside the abbey now, everyone waiting with anticipation. There's the Queen of Canada, in attendance of course. [a soft fart is heard] I believe she just queefed. The Prince makes his way down the aisle led by the Bishop of Newfoundland. People in attendance now gently tossing Captain Crunch as the Prince passes by. As of course is tradition. [the bishop and prince ascend the altar] Prince takes his place next to the large vat of butterscotch pudding. Oh, and here she comes. Yes, there she is! The aboot to be Princess of Canada. Isn't she ravishing, so innocent of heart, so strong in body, so hot in the face? She is indeed the living symbol of our great country. My God, she's beautiful.
Ike
[walks up to the TV] Princess, princess. [the bishop leads the princess to the altar to stand next to the prince]
Narrator
Canadian prince now dipping his arms into the pudding. [with a little assistance from the bishop] As is tradition. [the prince offers his forearms to the princess] Princess will of course scrape the pudding off the prince's arms, thus symbolizing their union. What a glorious day for our country and indeed the world. And now of course the- wait a minute. What's this? Oh. Uh oh. Something is going terribly wrong. The abbey is shaking violently as explosions abound. The top- Yes, the top of the abbey is collapsing. The prince and the princess look on in horror. This is not the tradition. This is not tradition at all. A giant hole now blasted into the ceiling, debris falling down and crushing several spectators, which is also not the tradition for a royal Canadian wedding. [a bright tractor beam appears] Bright beam of light shooting through the hole in the ceiling. [a cubic force field appears around the princess and lifts her up] The princess now in some kind of... isometric cube. [the prince is trying to break her free, but has no success at it] This is certainly breaking with tradition now.
Ike
[approaches the TV again] Booo. NOOO!
Narrator
Canadians in attendance cannot believe their eyes. Widespread panic. [the cube rises along the length of the light beam] The princess being... hoisted away. The little mushroom people of Nova Scotia, screaming with horror. [more large chunks of the ceiling fall] The prince is attempting to grab hold of the cube. The duke and the duchess of Calgary hiding behind the pews. This is indeed a horrible day for all of Canada, and therefore- and the pudding has just been knocked over! Oh, this does not go with tradition at all! The royal pudding now spilling all over the abbey as the princess is lifted up, up... And she's gone. The princess has been taken. This is indeed a horrible day for Canada, and therefore, the rest of the world. [Ike cries in front of the TV]
South Park Elementary, next day. The kindergartners are rehearsing again. The stage is set up like the inside of a mouth, with tonsils in the back.
Tooth
I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
Toothbrush
I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
Cast
Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. [the notes turn ominous, but no one joins them on stage, so the music stops.]
Mr. Mackey
[picks up the mic] His name is Toothuhkay! [a few seconds later, Ike, in costume, walks out still crying over the princess's abduction]
Dental Floss
Oh no! It's Tooth Decay.
Tooth
He's gonna get us.
Mr. Mackey
Now, now, Tooth Decay, your character is supposed to be mean and nasty. M'kay. Stop cryin'. [Ike continues crying] Nono. See, Tooth Decay can't be sad until Toothbrush and Dental Floss have gotten rid of him. You can't just start already sad; there's nowhere to go. Besides, there's no arc. M'kay. Oh for crying out loud! Alright, alright Tooth Decay, you just go home and sort yourself out! The rest of us will rehearse the finale again! And you'd better come back tomorrow with a different attitude, Tooth Decay! M'kay?! [Ike walks off stage, still crying]
South Park, day. Ike walks through town, alone. He walks by Tele's as a newscast is shown.
Anchor
The tornado was said to be the deadliest in fifty six years. In other news, it's been twenty-four hours now and the Princess of Canada is still missing. All of Canada is in mourning as nationwide suicides abound. [a shot of a small skyscraper. People in it begin jumping out of its windows to their deaths]
Suicide 1
The prinness is gone! AAAAAH!
Suicide 2
AAAAAH!
Suicide 3
AAAAAH!
Suicide 4
AAAAAH!
Suicide 5
AAAAAH!
Suicide 6
AAAAAH!
a train station
Suicide 7
The prinness is gone! [jumps up into the path of a speeding train and dies, blood splattered everywhere. Somewhere else, a man douses himself in lighter fluid and sets himself on fire]
A large crowd gathers at night for a vigil
Anchor
A massive candlelight vigil was held last night, led by the Canadian band, Rush.
Geddy Lee
And it seems to me you lived your life like a flower breaking wind. [farts. Members of the crowd begin killing themselves] Never knowing whom to count on... [Alex Lifeson shoots himself in the head. The singer breaks down and cries]
Anchor
the Prince of Canada has said that-... uh-... Uh we have just received breaking news that the Canadian government now knows who took the princess. The Canadian Prime Ministries instructing all people of Canadian descent to go home and... open their box of faith. [softly] Box of faith? What the fuck is that? [Ike understands and runs home. He goes into his room and to his closet. He tosses out as many toys as needed until he finds the box, then pulls it out into the room. He blows the dust off and reads the lid: "Open ONLY if instructed by the Prime Minister of Canada." He messes with the box until it pops open and small projector pops out]
Canadian PM
Hello there, my noble, strong, fellow Canadians. If you are watching this film strip, then no doubt Canada is in grave danger. As you know, the very heart of Canada is the Royal Family. If you have been ordered to open your Box of Faith, then one or more of the Royal Family must be in peril. Or else you just opened your Box of Faith and are watching this without being told to, in which case you are a dick. If you have indeed been instructed to open the box, then this is a call to arms! All Canadians in fighting condition are asked to meet by the tree in Edmonton. In your Box of Faith you will find all the items you need: a location beacon, a first-aid kit, and a sandwich. You may eat the sandwich now. Good luck, Canadian citizen, and God help. All of Canada is relying on you. [the film ends and Ike looks ahead for a few seconds. Moments later, he walks out of his room armed with a helmet, sword and shield. He walks down the hall and down the stairs, past Kyle on the sofa...]
Kyle
[noticing him] Where are you going? [Ike reaches the front door and has trouble getting it open. Kyle catches up] Ike, where are you going?
Ike
[gets the door open] I got to get to Canada and, and join the army, and save the pwincess. [walks out and closes the door. Kyle doesn't stop him]
South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison is at the blackboard solving some problems. Cartman looks bored as hell.
Mr. Garrison
Dialog
Mr. Mackey
[enters the class angrily] Kyle Broflovski! Do you mind telling me where your brother is?!
Kyle
[looks around] ...I don't know.
Mr. Mackey
How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!
Kyle
Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
Mr. Mackey
[walks to Kyle's desk and gets right in Kyle's face] Getting rid of Tooth Decay is what I'm tryin' to fuckin' do! [Cartman chuckles] He's your brother, Kyle Broflovski! Okay! How are you going to fix this?!
The Grand Canyon, night. A bus rolls along. Ike is seated near the driver, Ugly Bob is seated three rows back, across the aisle. Bob leans into the aisle after noticing Ike
Ugly Bob
Hey. Hey there. [Ike turns his head to look back at Bob] You going to Canada too? [leaves his seat and moves over to Kyle] What am I saying? Of course you're going to Canada. You're Canadian, sure enough. Open your Box of Faith, did you? Me too. They can't take our princess and get away with it. Mind if I sit down? [moves to the window side of the seat and sits] Soon as I heard the call there was no question I was gonna sign up. Didn't care how far away I was. I was gonna get to that rally point at the tree in Edmonton. Didn't know there were other Canadians living here in the U.S. I'm from Toronto originally, but everywhere I went people were terrified by my disfigurement. I have to wear this bag on my head because I'm hideously ugly. Had to move here to the United States. Here, people don't think I look ugly. They just think I look Canadian. [extends his right hand out to shake Ike's, but Ike just looks at him] The name's Ugly Bob.
Tooth
I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
Toothbrush
I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
Cast
Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. [the notes turn ominous and stops. Kyle steps out in costume.]
Kyle
I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
Mr. Mackey
[as Kyle does his line] Hold it, hold it, stop! [Kyle stops] What. The fuck. Was that?
Kyle
I'm just doing the line.
Mr. Mackey
The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!
Kyle
Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
Mr. Mackey
Oh you're trying! You call rolling your fat ass out on the stage and lazily blurting out your lines like a turtle takin' a shit, you call that tryin'?! This play is supposed to change [pounds the table with his fist and stands up] how people think, Kyle! Get it fucking right! [slamed the mic on the table and turns away from the stage. Several seconds later he turns back and sits] Pick it up from there!
And open field. A huge crowd of Canadians awaits its orders
Leader
Brave Canadians! You have answered the call, and now we must face our greatest foe! The princess has been kidnapped, and we believe this to be the work of... the giant!
Ugly Bob
Oh, the giant!
Canadian 1
Oh, the giant, that's not good.
Leader
We are attempting to attract the giant now, with a bowl of Kraft dinner. [a giant bowl of macaroni and cheese on wheels is shown] When the giant arrives we will attack him with our guns, our swords, our- [loud footsteps are felt as the giant approaches]
The Giant
Fee fi fo fum! I smell Kraft dinner.
Canadian 2
It's the giant!
Canadian 3
Skod! [the giant walks up to the bowl and everyone else begins to scatter]
Leader
Give us back the princess, Scott!
Scott
You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
Leader
You're a dick, Scott! You have always been... a dick! And then you got radiation poisoning in Ottowa and now you're a giant dick!
Scott
No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
Leader
Just hand over the princess of Canada!
Scott
Why would I take the princess of Canada?
Ike
Because you're a giant dick.
Scott
I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
Leader
Aw crap. Sorry everyone. Looks like we had some bad intel. Return to your homes! ["Let's go home. Come on, let's go. I guess we did what we could" Everyone disperses and Ike and Bob are left alone with Scott]
Ugly Bob
Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?
Scott
What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!
Ugly Bob
Who?
Scott
The Native Canadians.
Ugly Bob
The Native Canadians?
The Arctic. Two Eskimo are spear-fishing through an opening in the ice.
Scott
There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.

Fart-loving eskimos! I'm sure they've taken the princess! Just look at them! Loudmouthed self-centered assholes!

Male
Ota-a kiednia unshke tia
Scott
Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up! [Ike looks at him] What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?! [turns around to find himself and his partners surrounded by the Eskimos] Oh shit!
South Park Elementary auditorium, back stage. Mr. Mackey has the kindergartners with him
Mr. Mackey
Wokay, in fifteen fucking minutes you all are not gonna care about this anymore, so I'll just say what I need to say. That was the worst rehearsal we have ever had! We are two days away from opening and you're all fuckin' around!
Dental Floss
That's because Tooth Decay sucks.
Dentist
Yeah, that's right.
Toothpaste
It's all Tooth Decay's fault.
Another kindergartner
It's him.
Mr. Mackey
Oh don't put this all on Tooth Decay! [approaches Dental Floss, gets down on one knee and gets in his face] Let me tell you something, Dental Floss! You're not as good as you fuckin' think you are! You're already acting like you're a star and we haven't even opened yet! OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES, DENTAL FLOSS! YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLOW YOUR SHOT!
An Eskimo camp. Scott, Ugly Bob, and Ike have been taken captive by the Indians and are seated by the campfire

Ugly Bob
He says that the taking of the princess was foretold.
Male
Iyach danich Iyahachdashey. Etiapo kitte kihine.
Ugly Bob
He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger thread to Canada who has the princess.
Male
Oteacha hiya. Oteacha chihiyata honhahaha.
Ugly Bob
He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it.
South Park Elementary auditorium, day. The kindergartners and Kyle are onstage while Mr. Mackey sulks in the seats
Mr. Mackey
I don't know what the Goddamned problem is. Maybe you all don't know serious tooth decay is, maybe you all just don't give a fuck. You all probably think you can live your lives cavity-free, m'kay, never givin' two shits about the plaque that's building on your teeth. Kyle, you have single-handedly destroyed all that which I worked on for the past six years. And so I want you to know, Kyle, once and for all, why this whole "dental hygiene" thing is so important to me. [gets sad and sniffles once in a while] Two years ago, I lost my father to tooth decay. M'kay? He was an intelligent, hard-workin' man, and my whole family watched as tooth decay took him in the blink of an eye! You've been told to brush and to floss, but do you really know the importance behind it?! DO YOU?!
The Arctic. An eskimo woman with a kid on her back leads the three guests through the ice

Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!

Ugly Bob
Don't worry. If there's one thing eskimos are good at, it's finding things.
Scott
Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
Ike
Stop being a dick, Scott!
Scott
Oh, so now I'm a dick!
Ugly Bob
Wait a minute. [they stop] Look! [in the distance is a castle. A princess inside it screams out]
Princess
AAAAAAH! [leaves the window]
Scott
It's the princess!
Ike
Princess! [they all run to the castle]
South Park Elementary auditorium, opening night for the previews. The seats are full and the kindergartners present their play
Cast
Your teeth are your friends. They're friends in your mouth. Take care of your friends or they'll rot and fall out.
Dentist
Visit your dentist. He is your friend too. [a very angry Mr. Mackey is in the audience barely containing himself]
Dental Floss
And dental floss also is here to help you.
Kyle
Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
Mr. Mackey
FLAT! You're FLAT!
Inside the castle, the five make their way to the princess.
Scott
There!
Princess
[hoisted up in the air. Her arms are tied to the ceiling, her legs to the ground] Please, save me! You have to hurry! It wants to kill me!
Scott
Who took you, Princess?!
Princess
I should have listened! I didn't believe it was real! Oh God! It's behind you! [a giant monster appears behind them, and they turn to see...]
Scott
Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
Tooth Decay
[pounds the ground with his fists] I am Tooth Decay! Your teeth shall be mine!
Princess
I should have always brushed and flossed and avoided sweets!
Scott
Fart-loving tooth decay! I'll fix you! [tries to attack Tooth Decay, but Tooth Decay swats him out of the way. Scott hits a wall and is knocked unconscious by it. The eskimo hits it with her harpoon, but it just pulls the harpoon out and tosses it away]
Female
Bitchen junako. [Tooth Decay sweeps her away and she and her baby smash into another wall, becoming unconscious]
Princess
Save me! Save me!
Ugly Bob
It's coming for me! Help!
Princess
Help! [Ike surveys the situation and then, determined, goes over to Ugly Bob. He climbs Bob's body until he reaches Bob's head]
Ike
Princess, look away! [pulls the paper bag from Ugly Bob's face. Tooth Decay backs up, frightened. The princess shuts her eyes and Tooth Decay takes a step forward, then freezes in place. Ike puts the bag back on Ugly Bob's head]
Scott
[comes to] What the? [gets up and goes to Tooth Decay] You did it, kid!
Female
[comes to] Washia hayub 'an.
Baby
Nejenego ha'i aa dalah. [Ike begins taking down the princess]
Princess
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
South Park Elementary's auditorium, opening night for the previews. We have reach intermission
Mr. Mackey
[the audience can hear him even though he's backstage] I want you all to take a serious fucking look at yourselves! M'kay?! Act I was pure fucking dogshit! If Tooth Decay is singin' flat, then the whole fuckin' thing sounds flat! Wuhkay?!
Sgt. Yates
[goes backstage] Mr. Mackey? Mr. Mackey! [Mr. Mackey turns around] We're putting a stop to this play! It's over.
Mr. Mackey
What?! Why?! Don't worry, I will be better! These kids just aren't listenin' to me!
Sgt. Yates
No. it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the sonofabitch.
Mr. Mackey
[suddenly relieved] What?
Officer
Up in the Yukon. All bureause are confirming it.
Sgt. Yates
You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone.
Mr. Mackey
Oho... Oh God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!
Toothbrush
[everyone is confused] What?
The abbey church, day. Bells shaped like scrota peal out as guests arrive in theier square-wheeled limos
Narrator
The princess now giving the Canadian Medal of Courage to Ugly Bob, and also to Scott, who is of course a giant dick, aaand Katuktuk of the Yukon. And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition.
Kyle's house, night. The four boys are watching the wedding and knighting on TV
Kyle
I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. [smiles proudly for a while]
Stan
My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
Cartman
My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
Kyle
Hmmm, yeah.
Narrator
And now the scraping off of the pudding.
The abbey church, day. The wedding resumes where it left off at the beginning of the episode
Narrator
And now the scraping off of the pudding. [the princess wipes the pudding from the prince's arms] Isn't she beautiful, scraping off the pudding with the grace of a butterfly. She rubs the pudding on her face. [The prince takes the princess's right arm and starts pulling at it] The prince now attempting to remove one of the princess's arms. As is of course the tradition. The princess screaming with pain. Everyone watching with anticipation. ["crack" blood gushes out from the shoulder socket] And the arm is off! Things are back to normal here in Canada. Time-honored traditions are once again- [the prince lowers his pants] yehhss, the prince is sticking the princess's arm up his ass. There it goes. [the crowd claps] He's really making a good go of it. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world.
End of Royal Pudding

T.M.I.
South Park Elementary Cafeteria, lunch time. The students are eating lunch. Butters holds court at a table. Around him are Stan, Token, Clyde, Kevin, Kenny, Craig, and Kyle
Butters
And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
Kyle
[looks at Craig, who looks back] ...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
Butters
[jumps up on the bench] Skeletor is real??
Stan
No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
Butters
Skeletor's a lady??
Cartman
[storms into the cafeteria and walks towards the table] Goddamnit! [Butters sits back down] Who the fuck do they think they are?! [arrives and starts pacing back and forth] This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
Butters
Hey Eric.
Cartman
[begins to rattle the table] I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL! [Butters groans as Cartman shakes the table. Cartman soon stops] This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone too far this time!!
Kyle
You get in trouble again, Cartman?
Cartman
No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
Stan
Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.
Cartman
Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time! [flies into a rage again and rattles the table] The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you! [the other boys look at each other] You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
Stan
Yeah.
Cartman
Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
Kyle
[skeptical, as is tradition] No they didn't.
Cartman
Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
Stan
Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
Cartman
Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
Kyle
That doesn't make any sense.
Cartman
Go look for yourselves!!
The school hallway, moments later. The boys gather in front of the chart Cartman had mentioned
Cartman
There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
Butters
Is that really all our wiener sizes?
Cartman
Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: "Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches"! [turns around and faces the other boys] Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
Craig
Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.
Butters
Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?
Kyle
How big do they say mine is? [it's 2.4, just like Craig's. The boys continue talking amongst themselves. At the far end of the hall, Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey walk by and stop to look at the boys; Mr. Mackey is carrying a cup of coffee]
Principal Victoria
I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
Mr. Mackey
You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay. [takes a sip of coffee and walks away with the Principal]
Stan
Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
Cartman
No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
Butters
A conspiracy?
Cartman
They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
Kyle
Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
Cartman
Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
The Boys restroom, day, inside. Craig, Token, and Cartman have notepads with them. Clyde is standing on a small stool with his pants and briefs down.
Cartman
[measures, then writes down the result on his notepad] Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches. [Clyde zips up and turns around] You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
Clyde
[smiles, steps off the stool, and walks away] Alright.
Cartman
Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next? [Butters walks up and gets on the stool] Whip it out, Butters. [Butters drops his pants and briefs]
Butters
Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
Cartman
Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
Butters
Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
Cartman
Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
Butters
Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
Cartman
Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
Butters
I'm hung like a horse!
Cartman
Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers. [walks towards the door with Butters, Token and Craig, but their way is blocked by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.] What?
Kyle
Didn't you forget something?
Cartman
What, Kyle?
Kyle
You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
Cartman
I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. [points to his measurement]
Kyle
[grabs the notepad and has a look] Thirteen point seven inches?
Cartman
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Kyle
Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
Stan
You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
Cartman
Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
Stan
You just did that to everybody in class!
Cartman
Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! [goes to get measured by his peers.]
The school hallway. Clyde and Craig post the new measurements on the wall: "ACTUAL BOYS' PENIS SIZES". Stan supervises the placement of the sign
Stan
Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side. [continues directing until the poster is on just right] Yeup. [Cartman stands defiant until the poster is up. The girls begin to enter the hallway]
Millie
Actual boys' penis sizes?
Nelly
Gross!
Cartman
There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4! [The two girls leave and Red walks by] What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care! [wanders about approaching random girls] Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
Principal Victoria
[over the PA system] Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.
Cartman
Oh, Goddamnit!
The principal's office, moments later. Cartman is on a chair facing Principal Victoria, his arms folded.
Cartman
Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
Principal Victoria
You're darn right, Eric!
Cartman
For what?!
Principal Victoria
Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
Cartman
Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
Principal Victoria
[confused] What?
Cartman
I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
Principal Victoria
Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?
Cartman
You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
Principal Victoria
[sternly] The numbers we put up were height differentials. [Cartman has no reply to this]
Cartman
What?
Principal Victoria
We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.
Cartman
Those weren't our dick sizes?
Principal Victoria
Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
Cartman
I don't know! Why would you?!
Principal Victoria
We didn't!
Cartman
[gets off the chair and walks off] Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
Principal Victoria
This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!
Cartman
Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
Principal Victoria
Because you have an anger problem, Eric!
Cartman
Fuck you! No I don't!
A doctor's office. Cartman and his mom are visiting the doctor.
Doctor
What we need to figure out here is, are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism? Some rage addiction? It could be a lot of things.
Liane
My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
Doctor
Let's try a little experiment. I wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, Eric. Okay? How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
Cartman
Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
Doctor
What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat? I think you're a fat little boy. I think you're waaaaay too fat for your age. Does that make you feel any anger? Huh, fatty? Jelly-belly? You got jelly in your belly you little fat fuck? You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you've got tits like a 40-year-old woman? Fat boy?! [as the doctor's voice rises, Cartman takes out a cell phone and starts texting] Huh?! You like that, shitty-titty jelly-belly?! [stands up and starts provoking him] Oh yeah, he's a big boy!! Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!! Big old jiggly fatty butt!! [Cartman seems unfazed, so the doctor relents and sits down. Cartman continues texting, clears his throat, and resumes texting] ...Huh. Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman. Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all. In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even-tempered children I've ever seen.
Receptionist
[opens the door and peeks in] Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency. [leaves and closes the door]
Doctor
Excuse me. [leaves his chair and walks to his desk, where he picks up the phone] Carol, what? ...Whoa, calm down honey. What do you mean? Web chat with wha-? What 14-year-old girl? Carol, I would ne- [Cartman puts down the phone quietly. Liane simply notices, but stays quiet] No I don't have a criminal record. Who would- Who is Mitch Conner?! There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no- No no, Carol, put down the gun, swee- uh sweetie, come on, put down the ["blam."] Carol? Carol! [looks at Cartman]
Cartman
I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
South Park Elementary Library, evening. Principal Victoria has called a school meeting. Mr. Mackey is present.
Principal Victoria
Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
Randy
Oh dear.
Principal Victoria
Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
Randy
Did they measure from the base or from the balls? [no one says a thing for six seconds]
Mrs. Stevens
How does the school let things like this happen??
Principal Victoria
Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
Randy
[stands up and faces the other parents] I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade Class. Mr. Garrison has given class time to Randy, who is reclining on Mr. Garrison's desk casually.
Randy
Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
Girl with Brown Coat
[first appearance on the show] They have sex?
Randy
Good! The man puts his penis [makes a fist with his left hand.] Okay? Into the woman's vagina. [pronounces the g with a heavy h sound and jabs his left arm through the air, through an imaginary vagina formed with his cupped right hand] Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is [starts writing the equation on the board: (L×d)+W/G)/(∠∝(2@t)] Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale [pulls down the projector screen] and... [pulls something out of his back pocket] a protractor as well. [walks to a projector] Let's look at it on the graph here.. [wheels it into view and positions it right in front of the screen, then turns on the projector. A picture of a happy, naked mad in profile appears on the screen. The length of his penis is 8 inches, the angle is 135 degrees] Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
This sign greets Cartman and other people as they sign in and take their seats in a class.
Doctor
I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
Bodybuilder
We didn't make any effort, we didn't have a choice!
Tea Bag Participant
Yeah! This is bullshit!
Doctor
Together, we're gonna learn what makes us angry, okay? And how to better deal with it so we don't get ourselves into trouble anymore.
Michael
So lame! Why doesn't everyone just die?!
Tuong Lu Kim
Rook! Ifuh somebody ordereduh shitty beef, anduh complain because they say they ordereduh shitty shrimp, It's notuh my fault he gets the shitty chicken poured all over hisuh fucking head!
Tea Bag Participant
We have good reason to be angry! This country is going to shit! We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone, and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
Doctor
Right. See, what we all need to do is chaaannel our various reasons for anger, and learn to control it.
Wigger
Man, this shit wack, manh. I just see all this shit fummah. I'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh. Bitch be callin me tappin that shit, man.
Cartman
Why the fuck am I here?!
Doctor
Well, Eric, because I know you want to... control your anger and become a better person.
Cartman
Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
Doctor
NO No, I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
Cartman
Oh, that's cool.
South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade Class. Randy continues his lecture.
Randy
And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
Girl with Blue Vest
[first appearance on the show] What's a penis?
Randy
[six second later, after mulling what his answer would be] ...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring. [now quickly] Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class? [a girl is shown] Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud
Riley
Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
Randy
[writes the number on the board] Four point four inches...
Riley
Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.
Randy
Seven centimeters...
Riley
Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.
Randy
Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person "Randy" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. [grins at the class]
Anger Management Class, later.
Doctor
Okay, what we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger. Daniel, could you stand up please? [Daniel stands up with his arms still crossed.] What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
Daniel
[the Tea Bag participant] Stupid-ass blind liberals!
Doctor
Okay, great. Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid-ass blind liberal? [the bodybuilder stands up and walks up to Daniel] And what makes you angriest, Chase?
Chase
Scrawny-ass sissies!
Doctor
Okay, Daniel's a scrawny-ass sissy, he just cut in front of you in line at the bank. Go!
Chase
Hey! What, do you think I got a small dick?! Huh?! [strikes him on the chest]
Daniel
Huh I don't have a small penis! My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
Doctor
[doesn't say anything for a few seconds] ...Okay. Uh, why don't we uh do some roleplaying now with Wayne D, who gets angriest at his mom. [Wayne D stands and moves to the center of the room] Gretchen, can you play Wayne D's mom for us? [Gretchen, a butch woman, stands up and walks to the middle of the room]
Wayne D
Yo, bitch! You think you bad? Just 'cause you're a mom don't mean I can't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mang!
Gretchen
I may be female on the outside, but I still have a bigger penis than you!
Wayne D
I don't have a small penis! Don't say that, it isn't true! It isn't true!
Tuong Lu Kim
That's enough! I've beem sick of everyone talk aboutuh penis shize!
Daniel
Yeah, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!
Doctor
[if he wasn't sure before, he is now] Does... everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
Chase
No.
Gretchen
No.
Tuong Lu Kim
Not me.
Daniel
Nnnooo.
Wayne D
No, my, my shit be packing, manh.
Cartman
My penis is 13 inches long.
Doctor
Hmmm.
Mr. Garrison's room, day. The kids have another guest speaker
Guest Speaker
Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnod, and I'm an "actual doctor" of human sexuality and behavior. Unfortunately you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days, and I am here to set things straight.
Wendy
Thank God.
Ms. Turnod
I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually [turns around, picks up some chalk and starts writing down the equation on the board: ((L×G)/(∠A°))÷(M/W)] Length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width- [the classroom door flies open and Randy is at the door, incensed]
Randy
Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE [runs up and attacks Ms. Turnod. She responds with a punch and a kick to the balls. They trade punches as the class looks on. Randy knocks her to the floor, gets on top of her, and keeps punching away]
Anger Management Class, a day or two later. Randy is now in there with the other seven members.
Doctor
We all want to welcome our new member, Randy. Say hi to everyone, Randy.
Randy
Aw, suck it! All o'ya!
Doctor
Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?
Randy
You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
Daniel
Goddamn right! Socialist fascist!
Randy
[has a lighter and tries to torch a chair with it] Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
Doctor
Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?
Randy
No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
Doctor
If you take a minute to think about your anger, and give- [the chair lights up in flames] whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!
Randy
Yeeaahh!
Cartman
Yeah dude!
Wayne D
Man, that shit be burnin' an' shit, manh!
Gretchen
Yeeaahh!
Cartman
[takes his chair and swings it against a wall, where it shatters] Yeah!
The class begins to riot. Randy walks to some curtains and sets them on fire.
Randy
Yeeaahh! [the office is soon destroyed]
FedEx Office, day. A clerk and customer do business
Clerk
Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?
Customer
Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
Clerk
Alrighty, let's see what kind of-
Randy
[runs in with the other anger-management class members] Burn it down! [the other members go forth destroying the store. Randy walks up to a huge poster and sets it on fire]
Cartman
Burn it down, dude! [Daniel demolishes boxes with a bat while Gretchen takes a pipe to other boxes. Michael kicks some boxes while Cartman takes a small hammer to a huge box. Wayne D fires away with a pistol while Chase fires away with a semi-automatic]
Randy
[approaches the counter to set it on fire] Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! [Gretchen reappears to bash more stuff up]
A news report. The media got wind of the riot
Field Reporter
Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
Recorded earlier
Randy
[holding the clerk hostage] This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
Field Reporter
What exactly are you angry about?
Randy
We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
Cartman
The Jews!
Randy
Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
Field Reporter
You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?
Randy
Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
Chase
Yeeaahh!
Randy
And we want-
Daniel
[runs into view] And we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate!
Randy
Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,
Wayne D
And my mom gotta stop trippin', manh. Bitch be trippin' all the time, manh.
Randy
Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh, [looks back at the other members.] is that it?
Cartman
No, and fuck Kyle!
Randy
Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
Field Reporter
Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?
Randy
No. No, that doesn't matter! [releases the clerk and turns to look at the other members] Fuck, really?!
Butters' house, day. Butters is measuring his penis again and again and putting down his measurements on a sheet of paper on a small table next to him
Linda
Butters, what are you doing?
Butters
Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! [throws down his pencil and notepad in disgust]
Linda
Your T.M.I.?
Butters
I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! [kicks his bed]
Linda
Butters, put your clothes on.
Butters
[begins to vent, pacing back and forth] Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
Linda
Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? [outside, some car rev by. Linda and Butters go to his window to look]
Driver 1
[in an SUV on monster wheels] Hey, everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America! Join the fight! [peels off]
Driver 2
[in a little red Corvette] We're gonna take down the Federal Expresses, the American Apparels, and the American Furniture Warehouse! [peels off]
Driver 3
[in a massive truck] We're fed up and we've had enough! [peels off]
The surgeon general's office, day. The surgeon general is there surrounded by her staff.
Aide 1
Surgeon general, twelve more FedExes have been taken over; the Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support!
Aide 2
They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country. We have to ask you to step down.
Rebecca Turnod
Are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands?
Aide 2
They're all really angry. We have to make them stop. Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?
Aide 3
Team is standing by, sir.
Doctor
[charges in] 'Scuse me. Excuse me, let me through.
Rebecca Turnod
Who is this?
Doctor
[approaches the surgeon general's desk] Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening. I have found a direct correlation between the anger, and T.M.I. [goes to a whiteboard and beings writing out the equation: Anger equals (L×W)/(M^2-∠)+YAW ] Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw. [finishes and looks at the surgeon general] Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry or always finding new reasons to be angry, it means they have a very very very very small dick.
Rebecca Turnod
Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter. The T.M.I. equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed. There's nothing we can do about it.
Doctor
Isn't there? Isn't... there?
The FedEx in Fairplay, thoroughly destroyed, day.
Daniel
We've waited long enough, Randy! Let's start killin' these sons of bitches!
Woman
No, please!
Cartman
Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
Wayne D
Yo let's cap these bitches, manh! Let's cap an leave em at the back of the building, manh!
Michael
[watching a working TV, turns around and calls the other members] Hey, come over here. Look. [turns to watch TV again as the others arrive]
Announcer
We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
Rebecca Turnod
Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk. The established equation is a hundred percent accurate.
Randy
Rrrr!
Daniel
Shhh.
Rebecca Turnod
However, due to recently collected data, we are making one change. [the T.M.I. scale is shown] The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from 6 inches to 1.5 inches. [the lower regions of the chart shrink and the NICE region takes up the slack] Anyone with a T.M.I. of over 1.5 inches is considered "above average". [she puts her stamp of approval to it]
Randy

The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!

Cartman
Wait, what?
Randy
America is back!
America is back!

Cartman
Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
Randy
We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!

Cartman
I'm still fucking angry!
Randy
Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!

End of T.M.I.

Crack Baby Athletic Association
A golden Buddha is shown in a garden. Around him are smaller Buddhas, most of which are golden as well. In front of all this are Terrance and Phillip, dressed in saffron cloth. Terrance farts on Phillip, causing Stan and Kyle to laugh. They are watching an episode of the Terrance and Phillip show.
Phillip
That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance [sharts on Terrance. Terrance and Phillip laugh, Stan and Kyle laugh]
Kyle
[through his laughter] Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
Stan
I know! This is awesome!
Kyle
I'm so happy! [wipes off the tip of his nose]
Announcer
Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these messages. [a commercial comes on]
Singer
So much sufferin'... [continues singing in the background. Pictures of babies in bad shape begin to appear]
Kyle
Oh no! It's that [puts up his right hand to block his view, shuts his eyes and looks away] super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
Stan
What?
Kyle
Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! [a baby tries to get his bearing in order to crawl, but slowly collapses. Another one looks in a mirror, then lowers his hed]
Sarah McLachlan
These are images of babies born addicted to crack cocaine. Their mothers have abandoned them. They lie in the dark, crying, with nobody to hold them.
Stan
Aw dude, that's so sad. [puts up his right hand and looks away]
Kyle
Why do they have to put this on TV?! [a doctor carries a baby in order to calm him down]
Sarah McLachlan
Their world is bleak, lonely, and hopeless. [McLachlan is finally shown] Hello, I'm Sarah McLachlan, and I was famous for two months. Each year, thousands of babies are born addicted to crack and lie in hospitals without a mother to hold them. [more pictures are shown] Won't you volunteer today? Look at these pictures. They need you.
Stan
Awww dude, awwww.
Kyle
Aaaggh, God.
Sarah McLachlan
Please. Go to your local hospital now. Here are some more pictures. [one of a baby with two boils on his face, another one of a sickly baby crawling]
Kyle
I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! [runs off, leaving Stan on the sofa looking away]
Colorado Medical Center, day. A nurse walks down the hall with Kyle
Nurse
It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.
Kyle
What exactly can I do to help?
Nurse
Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now. [a large room full of baby cribs] I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.
Kyle
Oh it's, it's so sad.
Nurse
Come, come, right over here. [leads him to a therapy room] We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. [the door opens and out walks Cartman]
Cartman
Oh. Hey Kyle.
Kyle
[at first surprised, now suspicious] What are you doing here?
Cartman
I'm volunteering.
Kyle
[remains suspicious] ...What are you doing here?!
Cartman
[firmly] I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
Nurse
Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.
Kyle
Why do you have a video camera?
Cartman
I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?! [to the nurse] Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. [walks away]
Ms. Williams
Bye, Eric. [Kyle just watches as Cartman goes to the elevator and closes its doors behind him]
Kyle
I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
Ms. Williams
Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately.
Kyle
Thanks. [walks to a window looking over a parking lot. The nurse walks off in the opposite direction]
As Kyle watches, Cartman walks through the parking lot and meets Craig. Cartman looks over his shoulder on his way to meet Craig. Kyle decides to follow them and takes the next elevator down. Cartman and Craig stop on the sidewalk around the medical center. Cartman checks his watch as if he's waiting for someone. Day has turned to evening. Kyle hides in the shadows and looks on. Clyde walks up to Cartman and Craig, who has a camera of his own. The three of them chat a bit, then walk away laughing. Kyle keeps his distance, but follows them nonetheless. Cartman, Craig, and Clyde walk up to a slender building in town, next to Tom's Rhinoplasty, and enter it. Kyle arrives a couple of second laster. He enters as well and climbs up some stairs, but doesn't reach the second floor. Instead, he stays a few steps from the top and watches as Cartman, Craig, and Clyde put some mini-VHS tapes on a table for Butters. Butters, typing away on a computer, becomes a video editor, splicing videos from their tapes together.
Kyle
What's going on?!
Butters
[startled] Wuuuuhhhhhh! [falls off the chair]
Cartman
Ah, crap! [rolls his eyes]
moments later, Cartman, Craig, Clyde, and Butters sit at a table in the slender building and look at Kyle
Cartman
Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
Kyle
So what are you doing?!
Cartman
What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
Kyle
Alright, what is it?!
Cartman
Crack baby basketball. [Kyle pushes his chair away from the table, gets up, and begins to leave] Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us! [Kyle reaches the staurs] We could actually really use you!
Kyle
Why do you need me?
Cartman
Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping. [Kyle heads downstairs] Dammit! [Kyle leaves the building; Cartman races down the stairs to catch up to him] Kyle, wait I- [Kyle slams the door shut and walks away. Cartman opens it and catches up to Kyle] Kyle, hold on a second!
Kyle
I knew you were doing something terrible!
Cartman
What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
Kyle
Lots of people will when I tell them!
Cartman
We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. [Kyle stops walking, then turns around]
Kyle
You what?
Cartman
Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
Kyle
A thousand dollars.
Cartman
Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
Denny's, night. Cartman leads the other four to Denny's. He opens the door for them
Cartman
After you. [the other four enter.]
Kyle
There's a big wait to sit down.
Waiter
Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir.
Cartman
Come on. [the other boys follow]
a table. The boys are seated and enjoying their meals
Cartman
We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
Kyle
Jesus Christ.
Craig
It's awesome.
Cartman
It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
Butters
Every single night.
Cartman
Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
Kyle
Wow...
In the back seat of a limo
Cartman
We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
In a karaoke bar. Butters is rapping and dancing to a teleprompter

End of Crack Baby Athletic Association

City Sushi
Downtown South Park. There's traffic and people on the sidewalk. Among all that is a small postman who looks pretty familiar. The postman stops at a kitchenware place and knocks on the door. A cashier comes to the door and opens it
Butters
Hello sir. Postman Butters with a special delivery for you. [hands him a flyer]
Cashier
What's this?
Butters
An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
Cashier
Thanks.
Butters
You can count on Postman Butters! [salutes and leaves. As he does so, the cashier makes a ball out of the flyer and tosses it away. Butters doesn't notice, but instead sees a woman coming up and hands her a flyer] Special delivery, ma'am. [sees a man coming up and hands him a flyer. The woman crumples up her flyer and tosses it away] Here you are, sir. [the man balls up and tosses his flyer away] Brand new sushi restaurant in town. [Butters sees another man and hands him a flyer] A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! [the man crumples up his flyer and tosses is away. Butters ends up in front of City Wok and enters. He approaches the counter]
Tuong Lu Kim
Welcome to Shitty Wok. Can I take a order prease?
Butters
Hello, sir. Postman Butters here with a special delivery for you.
Tuong Lu Kim
[leaves the counter] Wha you talking 'bout?
Butters
It's a coupon for a brand-new Asian restaurant that just opened up in town.
Tuong Lu Kim
A what? Ret me see that! [grabs the flyer] Oh no, a sushi prace? How come every time a hard-working Chinese man open a business, some shmelly Japanese dog has to come and try invade him?!
Butters
Uhhhh I don't know, I'm just bein' paid to hand out flyers.
Tuong Lu Kim
Where is this Japanese-uh toiret bowl?! How far from my Shitty Wok?!
Butters
Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
Tuong Lu Kim
What?! Whaaat?! [runs outside and looks both ways. He looks to his left again... There it is: City Sushi, complete with cat statues] What the fuuuck?! [goes inside]
Inside City Sushi. Butters follows Mr. Kim in
Mr. Takiyama
Welcome to City Sushi. Can I take er order prease?
Tuong Lu Kim
What's the big idea putting your Shitty Sushi right next to my Shitty Wok?!
Mr. Takiyama
I'm sorry I do not understand your accent. You want a Shitty tuna roll?
Tuong Lu Kim
No I don't want Shitty tuna roll! I want you to go find another shitty town to open your Shitty Sushi prace!
Mr. Takiyama
Why don't you please ujust speak Engrish? Maybe I can understand you!
Tuong Lu Kim
I am speaking Engrish! Why don't you speak a fucking Engrish, you soba eating fuck!
Mr. Takiyama
Get out or I call porice!
Tuong Lu Kim
Come on, kid, you don't wanna eat this-a Shitty Sushi! It give you worms.
Mr. Takiyama
Better than Shitty Kung Pao Chicken made from cat! [Mr. Kim turns and runs to the counter, jumps over it and lands a blow in Mr. Takiyama's face. They trade blows. Mr. Kim ends with an uppercut]
Butters' house, day. Sgt. Yates and another office bring Butters home. Sgt. Yates knocks, Mr. Stotch answers
Steven
Hello?
Sgt. Yates
Sir, does this mailman belong to you?
Stephen
That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?
Sgt. Yates
There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.
Stephen
What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!
Butters
But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
Stephen
Don't talk back to me! [Butters goes inside]
Sgt. Yates
We'll send a bill for the damages, [the officers turn and leave] but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? [Stephen closes the door]
Butters' house, inside. Linda meets Stephen at the foot of the stairs as he has words with Butters
Stephen
Go up to your room, now! [Butters goes upstairs]
Linda
What's going on?
Stephen
Butters started an Asian turf war!
Linda
Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
Stephen
I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.
Center for Criminally Insane Children. Inside, a doctor is in a lab with Butters as Linda and Stephen wait outside. The doctor opens the door and sighs. He meets with Butters' parents.
Stephen
Well Dr. Janus?
Dr. Janus
I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.
Linda
What?
Dr. Janus
There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named "Postman Butters" and yet another is "Fireman Butters." And then there's even "Inspector Butters" and uh, "Professor Chaos".
Linda
Oh my God!
Dr. Janus
From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.
Linda
Oh, poor Butters!
Stephen
Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?
Dr. Janus
No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point. [glances at Butters] What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication.
News report, outside the two Asian restaurants, day
Field Reporter
Tom, a brand new sushi place has opened in South Park, adding to our booming Asian district. With the addition of the new Chinese restaurant, townspeople are officially naming this whole Chinatown area "Little Tokyo."
Tuong Lu Kim
[comes out of his restaurant and sees the sign] What the fuuuck?! [goes into City Sushi] You see what happen?!
Mr. Takiyama
I told you not to come in here!
Tuong Lu Kim
Now everyone in town think a Chinese and a Japanese are the same fucking thing!
Mr. Takiyama
I don't even know what the fuck you are saying! Uhpupuh putuh peepee!
Tuong Lu Kim
Aaah you Japanese racist! [Mr. Kim launches at Mr. Takiyama like he did before, and they trade blows again.]
Butters' house, night. Steven is reading the newspaper at his den.
Linda
[runs in] Stephen! Stephen, come quick! It's butters! [runs off. He follows her out. They reach the backyard] Look!
Butters
[pretending he's a trucker in his cab] Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!
Linda
Now he thinks he's a truck driver. [cries into Stephen's shoulder]
Stephen
Oh God the medication isn't working!
Butters
It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. [Stephen runs up to him]
Stephen
Butters! Butters!! [grabs Butters by the shoulders and shakes him hard] BUTTERRRRS!
Butters
Oh hey Dad.
Stephen
You're back. You're back-he's back! [Stephen hugs Butters tight and cries.] I love you son!
Butters
I love you too, Dad.
Stephen
You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY! [Linda whimpers a bit]
City Sushi, day. Mr. Kim enters
Mr. Takiyama
Youuu, get out! I told you not to come in here!
Tuong Lu Kim
Okay, whoa, just hold a minute, hold a minute. I come ina peace.
Mr. Takiyama

Tuong Lu Kim
Come on, rook! All this fighting, it's just to sirry, you know? Chinese anda Japanese been fighting for so rong. It'sa ridicurous. What we need... is to have a tweaty.
Mr. Takiyama
What is tweaty?
Tuong Lu Kim
Nono, we need a tweaty.
Mr. Takiyama
A tweaty?
Tuong Lu Kim
No, not a treaty, a tweaty!
Mr. Takiyama
Oh, you mean a treaty?
Tuong Lu Kim
What the fuck is a tweaty?
Mr. Takiyama
No no, a treaty.
Tuong Lu Kim
A tweaty? [no response] Rook rook. All these racist people thinka that a Chinese and a Japanese are the same, right? So you and me, we put on a big assembry for all the kids are school, and then everyone understand curtural difference. You know, so they know fried rice isn't from Japan and teriyaki isn't from China.
Matt (Nelly's Dad)
Teriyaki isn't from China?
Tuong Lu Kim
[screams in his face] No, teriyaki isn't froma fucking China!
Mr. Takiyama
Very well. I will do assembly with you.
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh really? Oh great. [backs away] Okay, I'll meet you tomorrow and we can go over our prans. [turns around] And when you get to that assembry, you gonna get big surprise, you Japanese dog.
Dr. Janus' lab, day.
Dr. Janus
Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?
Butters
Sure.
Dr. Janus
What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
Butters
Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
Dr. Janus
You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?
Butters
Sure.
Dr. Janus
I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.
Butters
Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
Dr. Janus
Inspector Butters, what do you want?
Butters
Uh, well, to solve mysteries.
Dr. Janus
And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?
Butters
Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
Dr. Janus
He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?
Butters
What? Why would I do that?
Dr. Janus
Who am I speaking to now?
Butters
Me, Butters.
Dr. Janus
Ah, Butters. You're back.
Butters
Sir, I'm confused.
Dr. Janus
I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.
Butters
Really?
Dr. Janus
Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well.
Alias 1
[a teenaged personality] Don't listen to Dr. Janus! He's a mean old man and a big silly grown up.
Butters
Pardon me?
Alias 1
He's just a big old stick in the mud who doesn't like to play.
Dr. Janus
Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles.
Psycho Janus
Dr. Janus isn't going to be alive for long! I'm going to kill him!
Dr. Janus
Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?
Billy
Le's play Battleship! All hands on the poop deck!
Psycho Janus
Your soul will bleed for eternity!
Alias 2
You don't even know what sexy is, Mr. Harrison.
Alias 3
'That Big Red freshness lasts right through it!

Alias 4
The horned toad says we should go to Mexico. [Butters doesn't know what to make of this doctor, and now he's afraid]
Dr. Janus
What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?
Butters
Yes!
Butter's bedroom, later. He's looking at a video he took of himself on his computer
Butters
[a recording] This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
Butters
Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
Butters
[a recording] Well goodnight for now. [leaves the desk and goes to bed] Goodnight, Butters.
Butters
Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward. [fast-forwards three hours and then gasps. At normal speed, his bedroom door opens slowly. A second later, Dr. Janus enters] Dr. Janus? [nothing happens for three more hours, so Butters fast-forwards to 3:32 in the morning, when Dr. Janus unzips his pants, pulls out his dick and urinates all over Butters, puts his penis away, zips his pants up, and punches Butters HARD several times before running out of the bedroom. Six seconds later, Butters is fully awake]
Butters
[a recording] Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!
Butters
Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!
South Park Elementary Gymnasium, day. An Asian diversity poster is up on the projection screen. Mr. Mackey walks up next to it
Mr. Mackey
Okay, kids, today we have a special assembly, m'kay. Today we're going to learn about "the diversity of Asian people." Please welcome Mr. Lu Kim and Mr. Junichi Takiyama. [Walks away. "Shake that." A techno song comes on, followed my Mr. Kim and Mr. Takiyama dancing into view]
Tuong Lu Kim
Ni hao ma, South Park Erementary?!

Mr. Takiyama
Konnichiwa?!

Tuong Lu Kim
How are we arr feering?! [the music stops and the stand back to back]

Hey, Mr. Takiyama, did you know that China and Japan are actually uh different countries?
Mr. Takiyama
Oh, rearry? [they separate] Hey, that ruhight. If you ook at map, you can see.
Tuong Lu Kim
This whoooore thing is China, and Japan is this riiittle bitty country over here. And that's why the Japanese always try anda take over China!
Mr. Takiyama
What?!
Tuong Lu Kim
The Japanese planned to kill people in Nanking! The only thing Japanese ruve more than killing people is killing themselves! Suicide rate in Japan sky-high!
Mr. Takiyama
Fuck you!
Tuong Lu Kim
"Oh no, I'm a Japanese and I had a bad day! I think I'm gonna kill myself!"
Dr. Janus' lab, day. Mr. Janus leaves it, but is surprised to find Butters waiting for him
Dr. Janus
Oh, hello Butters. I wasn't expecting you till 5:30.
Butters
[nervous] Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
Dr. Janus
Yes. did you catch something?
Butters
Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
Dr. Janus
[sees the DVD disc and snatches it away, then checks it over] Oh, so you're on to me, huh you little shit?!
Butters
Huh?
Dr. Janus
What, Inspector butters figured out I set him up?!
Butters
Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
Dr. Janus
Oh come on! You think multiple personality disorder is real?! I've been using that to scam this town for seven years! Now I gotta get out of here, thanks to you! But I'm getting one last heist before I go, and you're gonna help me!
A jewelry shop, closed for the night. Dr. Janus destroys a window with a crow bar, then lifts Butters into the shop
Dr. Janus
Get in there! Move it, asshole!
Butters
This is illegal. We could get arrested. [Dr. Janus breaks into some display cases and swipes the jewels into a satchel that Butters is carrying] Oh Jesus!
Dr. Janus
They're all idiots! The vault! Get to the vault! Come on! Go! Movie it! [puts some welding goggles on Butters while getting a welding torch and firing it up] Get this on and get in that vault! That's where the real good are! [hands the lit torch to Butters] Torch that door, do you hear me?! I'll kill your parents! I'll kill your friends! I said get that fucking door open!
Butters
I'm trying, sir! [this changes Dr. Janus' behavior]
Dr. Janus
Butters? Butters, what are you doing? What is that? A blowtorch? Put that down! You're having another episode!
Butters
What?
Dr. Janus
Butters. Your name is Butters! Try and remember!
Butters
But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
Dr. Janus
[sighs loudly] Oh boy, you've really done it this time. I know it's not your fault, but I'm sorry. I'm going to have to alert the authorities, pal.
Delia's Jewelers, day. Dr. Janus addresses the crowd and the police
Dr. Janus
We have to try and understand that he can't help what he's doing, officer. He probably has no memory of it at all.
Sgt. Yates
Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus.
Steven
Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!
Sgt. Yates
Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.
Steven
Oh, we'll ground the shit out of him, detective. Thank you so much.
City Sushi, day. Mr. Takiyama is preparing some sushi behind the counter when Mr. Kim enters
Tuong Lu Kim
Herro-o.
Mr. Takiyama
You get the fuck out of my place!
Tuong Lu Kim
Okay, hold on, hold on, please! I'ma sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I admit it. I fucked you at the assembly. How about you and me together do an Asian Diversity festival?
Mr. Takiyama
Get the fuck out before I call police!
Tuong Lu Kim
Please, I admitting it, okay?I fucked you at assembly. There's no way around it. It was verrry sneaky. Kind of like Pearl Harbor. Okay? That was a little sneaky too, huh? Pearl Harbor kind of sneaky; I think we can all be a rittle sneaky sometimes, hm? But that sneaky Chinese man? He's gone! Okay? Okay, if we can have Asian Diversity festival, then we no longer have to deal witha "recial stereotypes." Prease.
Mr. Takiyama
Against my better judgment, I will trust you one more time. But this time, you'd better not rub your hands together when you turn around to walk away.
Tuong Lu Kim
Okay, see you tomorrow. [turns around and walks away, but stops long enough to rub his hands together] And on that Asian Diversity day you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japanese dog. [continues on his way]
Butters' backyard. His Postman Butters uniform is on the ground, and he pours some gas on it. He then lights it and begins throwing in more of his costumes, which are in a cardboard box labeled "Butters' Play Clothes"
Butters
That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more- [a bicycle horn stops him, and he holds on to his Professor Chaos mask. He looks over and sees Dr. Janus on a child's tricycle glaring at him] Waaahh! [runs away. As he does, he tosses the Professor Chaos mask back into the cardboard box. Butters runs into the neighborhood park. Dr. Janus chases him down and tackles him there.]
Dr. Janus
Butters please! It's me, Billy! You've gotta help! [moments later they are seated on a park bench] Please, Butters, I've tried to tell old Dr. Janus that we're in danger, but Dr. Janus doesn't rrealize thaere's a problem! [stands up and walks around] The mean man that lives in our head is trying to take over for good!
Butters
[sees a couple walking by] Um, excuse me?
Dr. Janus
[running around the bench to quickly distract Butters] No no nonono! Don't call out for help! [Dr. Janus opens his sports coat and points to a sidearm] He's got a gun.
Butters
Wahh!
Dr. Janus
If you draw any attention he'll kill us!
Butters
Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
Dr. Janus
No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters.
Butters
What??
Dr. Janus
You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.
Butters
No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
Dr. Janus
You don't understand! For some reason the mean man is getting stronger. You have to help me find out how to stop him! Please! [Butters sighs]
South Park's Little Tokyo presents "Asian Diversity Day." A pagoda now stands between the two restaurants, and all three buildings are decorated with strings of lights, dragons, fish, and other motifs. Both restaurants are also offering samples of their menus. Here's a news report
Field Reporter
Tom, I'm standing in the heart of South Park's Little Tokyo, where the multitude of our town's Chinese are putting on a festival. Both of them have gone all out to celebrate Asian culture. The owner of Shitty Wok has actually paid for what he calls "a tower of peace." [the Tower of Peace is shown] to symbolize harmony between the two restaurants
A Woman
Mr. Takiyama, a note for you. [Mr. Takiyama takes the note and reads it]
Tuong Lu Kim
[voice-over] Konnichiwa, my fine Japanese friend. It's so great that Chinese and Japanese are finarry getting arong. We should take our picture together on top of the Tower of Peace. I'm up there waiting for you now. [Mr. Takiyama looks up, but doesn't see anyone up there] Prease, come meet me on top of the Tower of Peace. It would be rearry nice. [Tuong Lu Kim's image begins to rubs its hands together] Yesss, and when you get to the top of that tower you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japane- Oh, sorry. Anyway, see you on top of tower! [Mr. Takiyama leaves his sample display booth and goes into the tower]
Meanwhile, in a mansion, Dr. Janus and Butters walk around with flashlights
Dr. Janus
[as Billy] Dr. Janus sure has a big house, dudn't he? He's planning on hurting people; I just know it!
Butters
It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
Dr. Janus
This is kinda fun. You're Inspector Butters and I'm your faithful assistant, Dr. Watson!
Butters
Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
Dr. Janus
Yeah! [Dr. Janus takes over] Butteers, what are you doing in my house?
Butters
Hah?
Dr. Janus
Oh dear. It's okay, Butters. You just think you're Inspector Butters right now.
Butters
Aw man.
Dr. Janus
[escorts Butters to the front door] Come on, let's get you home. [Billy takes over] Where are ya gon', Butters?
Butters
Oh, come on!
Dr. Janus
You aren't leaving here, Inspector! None of you are!
Butters
AAAAAAAAAAA! [runs away. Dr. Janus follows him upstairs] AAAAAAAAAAA!
Dr. Janus
Butters, come on! Try and come back to us! [Mean Guy takes over] You can't run forever! [pizza delivery man takes over] Excuse me, did someone order a pizza? [Dr. Janus takes over] Yes, that was me, but I'm a little busy at the moment. I'll be right back! [Mean Guy takes over as Butters enters an attic room or a penthouse floor] You'll never turn me in, Inspector Butters! You're dead!
Butters
Waaaa! [runs to the end of a hall and knocks on the door found there. The door opens and he falls into a room. He looks up and gasps at what he sees: walls covered in newspaper headlines about City Sushi and its chef, and one word written in blood: KILL. Dr. Janus reaches the room and Butters looks over his shoulder. Dr. Janus squints his face and combs over his hair: it's...]
Tuong Lu Kim
They wanna take over my Shitty Woookk?! Hory crap, what time is it? [checks his watch] Oh no, I'm rate! [turns around and runs downstairs, leaving Butters quite confused]
The Tower of Peace, night. Tuong Lu Kim runs upstairs and reaches the top, and sighs
Mr. Takiyama
What took you so long?!
Tuong Lu Kim
[takes out a cigarette, clips the end off, and lights it] Yes, I'm afraid my Tower of Peace was a rittle bit of trickery, Mr. Japanese dog. I'm going to put an end to you, and everyone gonna think it's just because you did what Japanese people ruve doing most. "No, don't do it! Don't kill yourself, prease!" [jumps on Mr. Takiyama and grabs him by the throat]
Mr. Takiyama
Urgh. Fuck you! I'ma not trying to kill myself!
Tuong Lu Kim
"No, don't do it, prease!" [some sirens are heard below] "So much to rive for!" [floodlights quickly find the two chefs, and they stand down]
Sgt. Yates
[through his bullhorn] This is South Park Police!
Tuong Lu Kim
Porice?! How?!
Sgt. Yates
We know the truth, Dr. Janus!
Mr. Takiyama
Thisa Chinise rat trying to kill me!
Sgt. Yates
He's not Chinese! He's white!
Tuong Lu Kim
What the fuck you talkin' about?!
Sgt. Yates
[enunciating] Your name is Dr. Janus!
Tuong Lu Kim
You people crazy! [Billy takes over] Listen to them! It's true! [Mean Guy takes over] Truth hurts, doesn't it, Janus! [Dr. Janus takes over] Who are you people?! Why are you all here?!
Mr. Takiyama
How could I ret myself berieve what man was a Chinese?! I have brought shame upon myself! [gets on the balcony and jumps off] Nooooo, this is racist stereotaipuuu! [crashes into his own restaurant, destroying it and dying at the same time]
Park County Police station, night. The police are talking to Butters and his parents
Steven
So you're telling us that Dr. Janus has been the owner of City Wok all this time?
Sgt. Yates
That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters. [the other officers present give Butters a round of applause.]
Butters
Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
Steven
Yes Butters. Thanks to you, maybe Dr. Janus can get back to his real self.
Sgt. Yates
[walks off] Yes, I'm sure he could. But, then again, [stops, then turns around] does the world really need another therapist?
Steven
Whattaya mean?
Sgt. Yates
Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town.
Desk Officer
Oh yeah.
Black Officer
Yeah. Let's just let him keep believing he's a Chinese man.
Sgt. Yates
Done!
Other Officers
Good! Alright! Alright! Yeah!
Blond Officer
Detective, he's asking for a blanket. Is that alright?
Sgt. Yates
Go ahead. We're gonna process him and get him back to the restaurant. [the officer who conveyed the request carries a blanket back to Tuong Lu Kim's cell. He enters...]
Tuong Lu Kim
Thank you. [...and leaves. The guard by the door locks it] "Oooooo, I hate Japanese people! They try and shut down my Shitty Wok, but they never wiiiiill. They're probably all ratching me, the Japanese. Ret them! I'm not even gonan swat that fryyy. They'll see. And they'll say 'Wow, that Shitty Wok owner. Why, he wouldn't even harm a fryyyyy.'" [City Wok is shown one more time]
End of City Sushi

You're Getting Old
Whistlin' Willy's, day. The boys are singing "Happy Birthday" to Stan. After that, Stan blows out the two Terrance and Phillip candles adorning the cake. Sharon takes a picture
Boys
Yay! [Liane sits next to Cartman with a camera of her own]
Cartman
Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
Butters
Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! [Stan reaches over and opens it]
Cartman
Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
Liane

Cartman
Yaaaay!
Kyle
Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
Liane
Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too. [in a softer voice] Otherwise, he gets a little upset.
Cartman
[eagerly opening his own gift] What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
Kyle
Oh God...
Stan
[opening his gift] Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.
Butters
I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
Cartman
Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox! [Speed Zone for XBOX 360] D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
Kyle

Stan
Oh thanks, dude.
Cartman

Here you are, muffin. [throws up another gift]
Cartman
Yaaaay! [rips the wrapper off] Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
Stan
Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
Kyle
Yeah dude!
Sharon
[walks up behind Stan] Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?
Kyle
Yeah they're the best!
Sharon
Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.
Stan
Mom, I'm 10 years old now.
Sharon
I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
Cartman
Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
The Marsh house, day. Sharon is in the kitchen washing dishes. Randy peeks in from the dining room, then walks into the kitchen
Randy
Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
Sharon
Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.
Randy
Well, do you really think we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
Sharon
Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!
Randy
Tween Wave?
Sharon
You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
Randy
Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
Sharon
This is different!
Randy
[waits a few seconds] ...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
Sharon
[stops washing and turns around] It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.
Randy
[mimicking an elderly man] "Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber."
Sharon
Fine, Randy! [hands him the CD] You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! [goes back to washing dishes]
Randy
I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. [walks out and towards his den.]
The den. Randy pops the CD into the CD drive on his computer, puts on his headphones, and listens. The song he hears starts with a good beat, and he bobs up and down ever so slightly to it, but then explosive diarrhea is heard, and Randy is startled. He makes sure it's not him farting or anything. Sharon appears at the doorway with hands on hips
Sharon
Well, it sounds like crap, right?!
Randy
Uh... NO I mean... [looks at Sharon] I like it.
Sharon
Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
Randy
No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
Sharon
Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
Randy
It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! [turns towards the computer. Sharon walks away exasperated. Randy clicks his fingers, but the farts noises keep coming and Randy keeps wincing]
CNN Headline News
Anchorman
It's called Tween Wave, and if you're a parent your kids are probably listening to it. A new music genre for the era from 2009 through 2012. or "The Tweens." Every generation has their music, but many parents say Tween Wave sounds like crap.
Man 1
It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.
Woman 1
This sounds like poo.
Man 2
[an elderly man] I certainly don't understand kids' music today. Sounds like diarrhea to me.
Anchorman
Kids however say they don't hear crap at all.
Kid 1
Parents are dumb.
Kid 2
They don't get it.
Kid 1
They don't get it. Parents are stupid.
Kid 3
Tween Wave is swick.
Kid 4
Tweem Wave is super swick and parents don't get it, 'cause their ears are old.
Kid 5
Parents are dumb.
The Marsh house, day. The boys' parents are gathered in the living room except for Randy
Sharon
We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.
Randy
[sitting with the boys] Ugh, that's so unfair!
Kyle
But that's our music! We like it!
Randy
Yeah it's good!
Sheila
What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
Stan
We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
Randy
Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
Gerald
I wanna educate you kids with some real music. [pops in a CD of The Police's "Synchronicity"] This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. [presses Play and "Every Breath You Take" starts up, but instead of lyrics you hear poop sounds]
The Boys
Yuck!
Randy
What?
Stan
That sounds like shit!
Gerald
Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
Kyle
Gross!
Cartman
Turn it off dude!
The Marsh house, night, Stan's room. Stan is in bed and Sharon is about to leave the room
Sharon
Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.
Stan
I know, Mom. I love you too.
Sharon
Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.
Stan
It's okay, Mom. I understand.
Sharon
That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. [Stan turns away and closes his eyes.]
Stan
'Night. [Sharon turns off the lights and closes the door. A few seconds later, Stan opens his eyes and looks at the door to make sure his mom isn't looking at him. Then he reaches under the mattress and pulls out his iPod] Haha. [listens to some music. Soon some shitty sounds creep in] Ugh. [tries some other tracks, but each one has poop noises in it. He sits up] What the hell? [tries more tracks, but all he hears now is shit]
The bus stop, day. Kenny, Cartman, and Kyle are listening to songs on their iPods
Kyle
[to Cartman] Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! [has Cartman listen to his song]
Cartman
Oh yeah, that one's cool. [gets into the rhythm] Yeah, this part's killer. [looks like he's exercising]
Kyle
[seeing Stan approach] Hey Stan. [hands Cartman his iPod]
Stan
Hey dudes.
Kyle
Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
Stan
Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
Kyle
Sure. [they walk off to a small clearing] What's up?
Stan
Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
Kyle
Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
Stan
No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
Kyle
Why? What's it sound like?
Stan
It... kind of sounds like shit.
Kyle
What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
Stan
No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close. [has Kyle listen to a track] You don't hear shit?
Kyle
No.
Stan
That doesn't sound like shit to you?
Kyle
NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
A doctor's office, day. Stan took Kyle's advice. A doctor is checking Stan's ears
Stan
And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
Doctor
Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?
Stan
Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
Doctor
[reads his medical file] This says you had a birthday recently?
Stan
I just turned 10.
Doctor
Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes.
Stan
So this is normal?
Doctor
It's very normal. Let's just do a quick ear exam. I'm gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear. [plays some music, with lots of fart sounds] What's that sound like to you?
Stan
Sounds like shit.
Doctor
Aha. Now I'm going to play you some good ole Bob Dylan. [plays a Dylan track. Dylan gets through three syllables before fart sounds replace him.]
Stan
Uh that sounds like shit too.
Doctor
Wait, this sounds like shit to you?
Stan
Yeah dude, it's just shit.
Doctor
Well that's very strange. [turns off the player] Hm, I'm gonna try somethin' else. [takes two pictures up to Stan] Look at these two pictures. One of them is an ad for Kevin James' new movie The Zookeeper, and the other is a turd in a microwave. Which one is the ad for The Zookeeper?
Stan
They both look the same. [true enough, except for the turds]
Doctor
You don't see any difference in the pictures?
Stan
No.
Doctor
[holds up the picture in his right hand] That is an ad for The Zookeeper and [holds up the picture in his left hand] that is a turd about to be reheated.
Stan
They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
Doctor
Oh dear. I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don't seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It's a condition called "being a cynical asshole."
Stan
Oh no.
Doctor
Yes. And there's no known cure, I'm afraid. Everything just seems shitty, and everyone starts to seem shitty, and everything they say just starts to [sounds shitty now, and Stan can't believe his ears. Soon, shit comes out of the doctor's mouth and Stan is more horrified]
Randy's den, night. Randy has transformed it into a mancave, with disco ball and clothes strewn everywhere. Randy is reading Rolling Stone and listening to Tween Wave music through his headphones
Sharon
[walking by] Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?
Randy
Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
Sharon
Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!
Randy
No it doesn't sound like crap to me! [one pooping sound and the headphones are off] Ugh. [gets up and walks around angrily]
Sharon
Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called "getting older", Randy. It's okay.
Randy
That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!
Sharon
It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!
Randy
Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
The bowling alley, night. "Steamy Ray Vaughn", who turns out to be Randy, is performing. Randy is tuning up when he turns to face his audience
Randy
Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake. [presses the play button] A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control! [fart noises, courtesy of his own butt] I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow [more fart noises. A janitor listens in] I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. [more fart noises.]
Bar Patron
You suck!
Randy
No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! [more fart noises.]
A ranch, day. Two elderly men stand at a fence. One of them is the janitor
Janitor/Farmer 1
Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
Farmer 2
Nah, I'd a heard that.
Janitor/Farmer 1
Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
Farmer Friend 2
What fer?
Janitor/Farmer 1
I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style. [sniffs] It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.
Farmer 2
You mean that guy that plays the blues and died in an airplane crash?
Janitor/Farmer 1
Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
Kyle's house, night. Kyle is playing a video game as Cartman and Kenny look on
Cartman
Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
Kenny
(Get him!)
Kyle
Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
Cartman
He's lying, dude. Hit X
Kenny
(No, he's telling the truth) [Stan walks in]
Stan
Hey guys.
Kyle
Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?
Stan
He said I have cynicism?
Cartman
What's that?
Stan
Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
Kyle
Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
Stan
Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
Cartman
Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
Kyle
Yeah, we got him!
Stan
How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
Kenny
(Hit the X button, Kyle!)
Kyle
We're gonna level up to detective!
Stan
That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
Kyle
Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
So the boys are now in a diner eating sundaes
Stan
[looking at his chocolate sundae] Aw, dude, this looks like shit.
Kyle
You don't wanna eat it?
Stan
It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
Cartman
Look like ice cream to me.
Kyle
Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
Stan
Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
Kyle
Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
Stan
What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
The bowling alley, night. Steamy Ray Vaughn is back in performing. The janitor and his farmer friend are present
Randy
City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much [puts the mic to his ass and farts into it]
Farmer Friend 2
Lord, I ain't never seen britches take a whoopin' like that.
Janitor/Farmer 1
I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
Randy
City bop! City yeah! [more fart sounds, and the song ends] Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
Steamy Nicks
[sounding a lot like a goat] Thank you, thank you so much. [Randy presses play and a song begins]
Farmer Friend 2
Wait now, who's that lady?
Janitor/Farmer 1
That there's Steamy Nicks.
Farmer Friend 2
You mean that gal who played for Fleetwood Mac and wrote that song "Landslide"?
Janitor/Farmer 1
Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches. [sure enough, she does this, and Randy joins her a second later]
Randy
Yoyoyo! [more fart sounds]
Sharon
[enters the bowling alley and heads straight for Randy] Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!
Janitor/Farmer 1
I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
Farmer Friend 2
Them britches have had enough!
Ronny's Diner, day. Stan is in a booth, all alone. A waitress comes up
Waitress
All alone today?
Stan
Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
Waitress
Well, what can I get you?
Stan
Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
Waitress
A little young to be so pessimistic, aren't ya kid?
Stan
Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. [just outside, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny walk by, not noticing Stan in the diner. Stan, on the other hand, notices them walk by. He quickly leaves the booth and catches up with them outside, where they're happily talking about something.]
Kyle
[laughing] I know! That's so hilarious!
Stan
I thought you guys were sick! [the other boys don't know what to say]
Cartman
...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. [Cartman and Kenny turn and walk away. Stan approaches Kyle]
Stan
Dude, you totally lied to me!
Kyle
No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
Stan
Where were you guys going?!
Kyle
Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
Stan
Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
Kyle
Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is "that looks like shit" and, and "this is shitty!"
Stan
You guys... don't wanna be around me?
Kyle
Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
Stan
Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
Kyle
[thinks about it, then sighs] Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
Stan
I won't say a word.
The Bijou theater, day. X-Men: First Class is playing. Inside, the theater is barely a fourth full. The boys sit in the third row.
Stan
Oh shit.
The Bijou theater, later on
Stan
Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! [apparently trailers are still playing]
Cartman
Oh cool, the movie trailers!
First trailer
Announcer
Adam Sandler is Jack. Adam Sandler is Jill. [Jack and Jill are at a well, and Jill poops on Jack... and they both look like turds]
Stan
Awww God! [squeezes his eyes shut and puts his hand over them]
Kyle
Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
Stan
Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
Second trailer
Announcer
[a toilet bowl spews out shit] This November, Adam Sandler shits in your eyes, ears, and mouth. [Some eyes, ear, and mouth are shown separately, and poop lands on each of them] It's Adam Sandler in Pbbbbbt, rated Arg for pirates. Fuck you!
Cartman
That looks pretty good.
Stan
How can you say that looks good?!
Kyle
Shhh, you're doing it again!
Third trailer
Announcer
Jim Carrey has a bunch of turds in his apartment. [dancing turds that create turd sounds, at that]
Stan
[shields his eyes from the shit] Ugh.
Cartman
Stan, knock it off!
Stan
But it's just crap.
Kyle
No, they're penguins! Stop it!
Announcer
[shots of Carrey carrying two turds, slipping on another turd, then taking a crap while two turds look on] It's Jim Carrey in Whatever, You'll Pay To Go See It. Fuck you! July 12.
Fourth trailer
Announcer
The President of the United States... is a duck?? [the duck pops up and opens its beak, which issues forth lots of shit] A duck is President and the whole country is goin' to the dogs. [two dogs are shown. One of them has his ass to the camera, and it begins to poop] Or whatever, the President is a dog. [the dog and duck now stand before a U.S. flag] Who cares? Coming June something. [a bunch of poop hits the scene, landing on the dog and duck and spelling out "JUNE"]
Stan
Oh come on, people!
Kyle
That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! [leaves his seat and walks out. Kenny and Cartman follow suit]
Stan
Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.
Cartman
No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
Stan
Me?! Did you see that shit?!
The Bijou, outside. Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman turn to leave the theater when Stan catches up to them.
Stan
Hang on guys!
Cartman
Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! [he and Kenny leave. Kyle stays behind]
Stan
Kyle?
Kyle
[turns around] Dude, you've... you've changed.
Stan
I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
Kyle
No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- [poop starts coming out of his mouth and spewing all over the place. He then turns into a huge turd - this is how Stan sees him. The rest of us see him normally. Stan turns and walks away. Kyle turns and walks away in the opposite direction]
The Marsh house, night. Randy and Sharon can be seen arguing through the living room windows
Randy
You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
Sharon
Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!
Randy
I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
Sharon
... You're 42 years old, Randy!
Randy
I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
Sharon
Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
across the street, behind some bushes, the two elderly men are there observing the argument
Farmer Friend 2
What do you suppose is goin' on in there?
Janitor/Farmer 1
Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
Farmer Friend 2
You... sure you wanna do this?
Janitor/Farmer 1
We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches.
back in the house
Sharon
You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! [the two men slide a side window up ever so quietly, go in, and sneak upstairs]
Randy
Why can't you ever just support me?!
Sharon
Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!
Randy
Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
Sharon
WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
Randy
Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! [Sharon reflects on this for a moment and her voice goes soft]
Sharon
I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.
Janitor/Farmer 1
[the two men sneak out the way they came in] Come on britches, we're settin' you free.
Randy
I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
Sharon
I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.
Randy
You kind of seem shitty to me too.
Sharon
People get older, Randy. People grow apart.
Stevie Nicks' "Landslide" begins to play. Stan is seen at Stark's Pond looking at it from a bench. Kyle walks up to Stan, but keeps some distance from him, then turns around and walks away. Stan looks at a flower... which has a huge turd growing from it. A bee lands on it. At the house, Shelly and Sharon pack away everything in the kitchen. Later, Randy explains things to Stan as Stan's dresser is being moved. Later, a realtor sets a "FOR SALE" sign in place - four bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, back yard. She finishes and walks away. Randy is driving a U-Haul truck and watches the house fade in the distance through the driver's rear-view mirror. Sharon and her kids move into a new place. Sharon works on her room and gives Stan the box for his room. Stan later sits in a swing in the new yard. A small sandlot is nearby. Instead of a wooden fence, the new place has a wrought-iron fence. Stan looks up at the sun, which is a glowing massive turd. Stan is then seen at the cafeteria sitting at a table with a bunch of turds that are supposed to be his classmates. All the food looks like shit too. At night the police arrest the Britches Bandits, the two men who stole Randy's underwear, and take the underwear in for evidence. Cartman and Kyle play a game on Kyle's sofa. They look at each other and seem to reach a mutual understanding, since they smile at each other. Stan walks all alone in South Park and passes a duck in a tux. He stops and looks at the duck, who keeps walking. It looks at him and quacks out shit, which lands on him. The last scene is Stan lying in his new bed, in his new bedroom, looking up at the ceiling.
End of You're Getting Old

Ass Burgers
Daytime at the apartment building Sharon and her kids moved into the last episode. Stan's clock read 6:59 AM. Inside his window you can see Whistlin' Willy's, and beyond that, the South Park Library. Stan had moved to Downtown South Park. The clock strikes 2 and the radio comes on, waking him up. A morning variety radio show comes on
Big Harry
Oh that's funny, that's real funny. Big Harry and Mike in the Morning talkin' about the new hit movie [poop sounds], a great comedy, starring [poop sounds] and [poop sounds].
Mike
I saw the movie last night, Big Harry, and it made me laugh so hard! This movie's about a [poop sounds] heh, he was suddenly all like [poop sounds] Aw, man it's great!
Big Harry
Big Harry and Mike in the Morning. We'll talk more about it but let's get to some music. The new Tween Wave band [poop sounds] with their song [poop sounds. The song begins to play. Stan sits up and turns the radio off]
Stan sits still for a few seconds, then still half-awake he goes into the shower and just stands there without taking off his hat. Later, he's at table as Sharon prepares breakfast for him. Shelly is sitting right in front of the TV eating cereal
Announcer
Coming this fall to Fox/CBS/FX. Jurassic Park and Lost in the same TV show! [poop sounds] Dinosaurs! [poop sounds] Lost Humans! [poop sounds] Future, yes! [poop sounds]
Sharon serves Stan his breakfast, which looks to Stan like a long tube of poop topped with a butter square. Stan just look at it, still half-asleep
Sharon
Stanley, eat your waffles. [Stan gets his knife and fork and cuts into the waffles, then starts eating.]
The sidewalk, morning. Stan has finished breakfast and is headed for the school bus stop with his head down. Be begins to hear the other boys as he draws near
Kyle
Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
Cartman
Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again! [at this point Stan stops and stands alongside the other boys, but he's still looking at the ground] But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
Kenny
(Are you serious?!)
Cartman
Yep!
Kyle
That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!
Cartman
Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
Kyle
[sighs gruffly] Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
Cartman
Wait what?
Kyle
That's what they're talking about on the news!
Cartman
Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
Kyle
Yes!
Cartman
You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
Kyle
You wanna bet? [begins to move off] Let's go ask my Dad right now!
Cartman
Okay, you're on, Jew! [he and Kenny follow Kyle away. Several seconds later, the bus shows up and Stan gets on. He takes an empty seat and no one sits next to him. He leans against the window, looking very sad]
South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade. Stan is in class, looking sad, and the seats that would hold Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman are empty.
Mr. Garrison
And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. [on the blackboard he had written "HPV Vaccination Day"]
Butters
Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
Mr. Garrison
No. Butters, that's not how it works.
Officer Barbrady
[offscreen] Mr. Garrison, [now onscreen] these three boys were caught playing hooky.
Cartman
Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? [Stan is hearing everything as if from a distance]
Mr. Garrison
Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.
Wendy
This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
Butters
You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
Cartman
That's right, it's a butt fungus.
Butters
Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
Stan
[in an angry outburst] God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! [looks around glaring at everyone, who look back at him, stunned]
Mr. Mackey's office, moments later
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks.
Stan
[after a few seconds' silence] I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
Mr. Mackey
Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?
Stan
How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? [tears start to well up around his eyes]
Mr. Mackey
Huh... e-excuse me a minute, Stan. m'kay? [stands up, goes to his desk, picks up his phone and starts dialing] Uh, hi, Ms. Bronski? Did we vaccinate Stan for the flu last year? We did? Uh oh... I think he's got Asperger's.
Breaking News
Announcer
This is breaking news, from CNN! Or Fox or, whatever. [The logos for Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC go by] Fuck you.
Anchor
The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's Syndrome from school vaccinations [a shot of a syringe and the words "ASPERGER'S SYNDROME" appear] has put the government in a tight spot. [a shot of Stan] At a press conference today the media heard from the young boy's father, Steamy Ray Vaughn.
Randy
It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the "government" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!
Anchor
In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed "Stan's Bill," putting an end to school-mandated vaccinations.
At the White House
Aide 1
Mr. President, the bill is ready. [the duck, wearing a tailor-made suit, quacks, with shit splattering out of its mouth]
Aide 2
Just sign right here, Mr. President. [the duck quacks again, splattering shit all over the document]
Aide 1
Aaand if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President. [the duck quacks again, splattering shit all over the second document. The parties involved gather for a quick photo opportunity]
Anchor
It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
Cartman's house, morning. He's in the kitchen cooking up a bunch of burgers. He's got two patties in a large pan, and he begins to sing.
Cartman
Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
South Park Elementary. Cartman approaches the nurse's office, having gotten excused from class. He stops, clears his throat, and enters. He starts to moan as he approaches the examination bed. He hops on and sits down
Nurse Bronski
Eric, what is it this time?
Cartman
[coughing somewhat] Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
Nurse Bronski
[puts down her notepad and starts examining him] You don't feel warm.
Cartman
Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
Nurse Bronski
Can you lay on your stomach?
Cartman
I-I'll try. I'll try. [lays on his stomach. The nurse sees something under his pants and pulls them back.]
Nurse Bronski
What the? [pulls back the briefs and pulls out a wrapped item, then unwraps it] What is this? A hamburger? [indeed, that's what she's holding]
Cartman
A what??
Nurse Bronski
[pulls out another hamburger] Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
Cartman
Are you serious? How can there be- [sighs] Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
Nurse Bronski
[pulls out a third hamburger] This doesn't make sense. Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
Cartman
What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
Nurse Bronski
Very funny!
Cartman
Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
Nurse Bronski
Get out of my office!
The school hallway. Kyle is at his locker as Wendy approaches.
Wendy
Hey Kyle? [immediately he knows what she's going to ask] Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
Kyle
I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
Wendy
I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
Boy 1
Those two should just screw and get it over with!
Boy 2
Yeaahh...
Kyle
I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
Wendy
Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-
Kyle
[puts his notebook away and closes his locker door] NO. I can't, Wendy. [walking away] All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go. [stops] And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally [makes a fist with his right hand and pounds it into his left palm] positive attitude.
Cartman
[rounds a corner and walks past Wendy and Kyle] Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
Kyle
What's the matter dude?
Cartman
[stops and backs up] I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
Kyle
You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one. [reaches for a burger and bites into it. That burger might have been in Cartman's underwear] Mmm. Hm, wow [swallows] This is really good, Cartman.
Cartman
Really?
Kyle
Yeah. [a girl walks by] Hey Riley! Try this hamburger. [hands her a burger] Cartman made them himself.
Riley
[unwraps and eats it] Wow. What is that?
Kyle
Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
Cartman
Gee, thanks Kyle!
Asperger's Research Center, day. A researcher takes Sharon and Stan on a tour of the facility
Researcher
The truth is we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh. All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits. [they stop next to a seated man who has wrapped his legs behind his neck and is making bubbles with bubble solution and farts] Good morning Mr. Mathers.
Mr. Mathers
Goodbye, doctor [farts into the blower]
Researcher
[signs and moves on] It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not. [they stop by a man urinating on a wall. Sharon and Stan notice what he's doing] We've got a new patient, Martin. I want you to meet Stan.
Martin
[turns around, still urinating, and Stan gets peed on] Nice to meet you.
Researcher
[moves on. Martin faces the wall again] Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness. [Stan shakes his head to get the piss off] Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately because of its name people think it's a disease to be made fun of. [the researcher opens a door to Room 209, a room of adults who are mentally deficient in one way or another. The adults are doing odd things and making odd sounds. He enters as Sharon and Stan look on a bit worried.] Alright everyone, let's have a seat. [Martin comes in, still urinating, and takes a seat. Stan finds a spot on a sofa and sits there.] Oh uh, we'll be done at about 5 pm, Mrs. Marsh. I'll call if it's any earlier.
Sharon
Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. [leaves and closes the door. Everyone sits in silence for a few minutes, then]
Researcher
Alright, are we clear?
Neo
We're clear! [everyone begins to move normally and arm themselves. They turn into Matrix characters]
Morpheus
Watch that window, Puck! [Neo gets into position by the window] Everyone, make sure this room isn't bugged! [the others seal the room] Alright Stan, listen up! We don't have a lot of time! You've been told Asperger's is real! It isn't! It's just a front we use to stay hidden!
Stan
Wait, it's not a real illness?
Morpheus
Of course not! If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's! That's just, that's just mean! [Stan says silent] There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down!
Stan
[gets off the sofa and walks towards the door] Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!
Morpheus
You've broken through their reality and they don't like it! Others deserve to know the truth! You see everything as shit, don't you?! [Stan stops in his tracks, astounded] Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit! Am I right?
Stan
[turns around] Yeah.
Neo
So do we. All of us here. We know the truth too.
Morpheus
We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?
Cartman Burger, day. Cartman has set up a burger stand in front of his house. Burgers are $5 each. Butters and Kenny are dressed in Cartman Burger uniforms and are helping Cartman run the stand, with Kyle at the grill. To Cartman's left is a booth made from a large Thompson delivery box that now houses a secret last process in burger preparation. A bunch of kids have already gathered and are eating the hottest thing in the neighborhood. Among the bunch are Scott, Craig, Kevin, and Lola. Kevin has just bought his burger and chips
Cartman
Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
Clyde
[walking by eating a burger] I just can't believe how yummy these are.
Cartman
There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
Molly
Thanks!
Cartman
How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
Kyle
About three minutes, fatass!
Cartman
Nice!
Butters
Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
Cartman
It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
Kyle
[rushes up in time to stop him] Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
Cartman
I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers. [Kyle may have noticed, but he doesn't say anything about the burgers stuffed down behind Cartman's ass and legs. Cartman goes into the booth, and moments later comes out with a fresh batch of finished burgers] Alright, these are good to go! [More kids have gathered. Among them are Esther, Heidi, Red, Bill, and Tommy.]
Asperger's Research Center, day. The people there set up their secret headquarters - computers, monitors, probes, etc.
Morpheus
Alright, is he ready to be sent in?
Bald Guy
He's ready! Beta levels are normal.
Stan
Who are you people?
Morpheus
We are the Secret Society of Cynics. [walks off a bit and sighs] Everything looks like shit to you, right? What if I were to tell you... that you're seeing the world the way it actually is?
Stan
Huh?
Morpheus
The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality
Stan
Aliens?
Morpheus
Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.
Neo 2
Yeah. Everything used to be awesome and cool, but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us!
Neo
Yeah!
Stan
Because of aliens? [crosses his arms]
Morpheus
Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?
Stan
Yeah I'm ready!
Morpheus
Let's send him in! [a member of the society prepares a drink for Stan - whiskey on the rocks - and gives it to Morpheus, who hands it over to Stan] Drink this. [Stan hesitates, then takes it and drinks it down. He steps outside and everything is as lovely as it ever was. No signs of shit anywhere.]
Stan
Ahhhh! [walks around town looking at it with a new sense of wonder, but his walking is off] Oh coool!
in a theater viewing an Adam Sandler film
Adam Sandler
Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino?
Jill
I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.
Stan
[laughs rather heartily, looking drunk] Adam Sandler's funny.
Cartman Burger, day. A crowd of kids has gathered, either enjoying their burgers or waiting in line. The little stand has been replaced by a bigger, studier stand, with a wooden awning along the façade and a covered area behind it. Some makeshift tables have been set out. Butters isn't present yet
Butters
[approaches Kyle] Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. [Kyle leaves to see who it is]
Kyle
Stan? [Stan is looking away, drunk]
Stan
[sees him] Kyle! [falls into Kyle's arms]
Kyl
Hey, Stan!
Sta
[his speech is slurred] Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
Kyle
Stan, are you alright?
Stan
Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
Kyle
Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. [smiles. Cartman leans back and looks over from the stand]
Stan
[squints his eyes] But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! [turns around excitedly]
Kyle
Dude. Have you been drinking?
Stan
You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
Kyle
It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh. [Cartman takes a quick order, then looks back at Stan and Kyle] Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
Stan
...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? [Cartman walks over, drying his hands off in the process]
Kyle
See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
Cartman
Everything alright here, Kyle?
Kyle
Yeah, it's fine.
Cartman
We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
Kyle
Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.
Stan
Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
Kyle
Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
Stan
[a couple of seconds of silence, then Stan gives him the finger.] Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit! [Kyle sighs and walks back to the burger stand] ...Kyle, I love you. [Kyle reappears a few seconds later, and Stan gives him the finger again.] You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you! [Kyle turns heel and walks back towards the stand] ...I love you. [Kyle does not return]
Next morning, Stan's room. The radio alarm wakes him up at 7, as usual. Laughter comes from the speaker
Big Harry
Big Harry and Mike in the Morning and in case you didn't catch last night's episode of [poop sounds], we're breakin' it down.
Mike
Oh Big Harry, when the [poop sounds] ran into the [poop sounds]- [Stan sits up, then scoots towards the alarm]
Big Harry
Nonono, no! How about when [poop sounds. Stan turns off the alarm, then hops off the bed.].
Asperger's Research Center, day. Stan goes into the center with a bad headache. He has a hangover.
Morpheus
He's back! [the other members jump up and gather around Stan] Did you see the illusionary world again?
Neo
How does it feel to be back in the Matrix?
Stan
I feel like total shit.
Bald Guy
It's okay. That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
Morpheus
Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now.
Stan
The rock creatures?
Morpheus
Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you.
Stan
Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
Neo
He's gonna pop! [Stan vomits and falls over on his face. He passes out. The other members gather around him even closer. Fade to black. Some time later, Stan's eyes blink.]
Morpheus
Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left.
Neo
You're pushin' him too hard!
Stan
Ugh God.
Morpheus
Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion. We're sending you back in! [a pair of doors in the ceiling slide open and a giant bottle of Jameson Irish Whiskey drops down, being held in place by a robotic arm. A nippled syringe pulls forward and enters Stan's mouth and begins pumping him full of whiskey. Stan can only look down helplessly]
A darkened boardroom. Sevem shadowed figures sit around a boardroom table
Figure 1
We all know why we are here. There's a rebellion in our midst and it must be SQUASHED OUT! [it's a McDonald's executive] We have to put an end, to Cartman Burgers. [the other executives seen are from KFC, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Subway, Chick-fil-A, and Taco Bell.]
Other Execs
Yes, yes, but what do we do?
KFC Exec
At KFC we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
Pizza Hut Exec
It's worse at Pizza Hut. Cartman Burgers choked out the market.
McDonald's Exec
[gets up from his chair and paces a bit] What makes them so good? For whatever reason, these Cartman Burgers satisfy the taste cravings from all of our restaurants!
Taco Bell Exec
[walks up to a chart and then turns to show the other execs.] There lies the secret. [eight restaurants are shown on the chart, including City Wok. An arrow from each of the restaurants points towards a Cartman Burger in the middle] It's the chemical compounds from all our flavors. Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC, all somehow infused into one burger.
KFC Exec
[walks up to a whiteboard on which a chemical compound from each restaurant is shown being mixed in a beaker and the combined solution being distilled into the Cartman Burger] It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredients of our food, breaking them down into some kind of... gas. And them somehow... infusing that gas into his hamburger. What kind of instrument could he be using to do this?
Pizza Hut Exec
It would have to be some sort of super Dutch oven.
Burger King Exec
But a Dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen. [Behind them, Stan breaks into the boardroom through the window]
Stan
[falls onto the floor] Aughah. [gets up and starts firing indiscriminately, moaning all the while. He falls on his back, fires off a few more shots, turns his head to his left side, and throws up. He passes out]
Some time later. The execs have tied him down to a chair quite securely and wait a while. An arm reaches forward and tries to rouse him
McDonald's Exec
Hey! Wake up. Come on now, wake up! [looks at the Taco Bell Exec] Use the smelling salts! [the Taco Bell Exec puts an enchirito under Stan's nose]
Stan
[sniffs and then smacks his lips a bit, finally waking up] ...Enchirito?
McDonald's Exec
You know the secret?
Stan
What? You guys are aliens?
McDonald's Exec
Stop playing with us! What's the secret behind Cartman Burger's amazing taste?!
Stan
Dude, I don't know!
Taco Bell Exec
He's lying! [reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a picture of Kyle] You see this kid in the picture? This guy is his best friend.
McDonald's Exec
Ah ha!
Stan
I'm not friends with him.
Taco Bell Exec
They've been through everything together. Inseparable.
Stan
No, no, we don't hang out anymore.
McDonald's Exec
Oho right, like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that?
Stan
Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
McDonald's Exec
Oh sure! Anyone would ditch out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good! Now stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers is so delicious!
Stan
I don't know!
McDonald's Exec
Alright, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way.
Cartman Burger, day. The place is packed with kids now. The crew is taking a break: Kenny and Butters are chatting by the grill as Kyle delivers some burgers to Cartman.
Kyle
There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.
Cartman
Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
Kyle
Next please. [smiles, but quickly frowns upon seeing the next customer] Oh, hey.
Stan
Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
Kyle
What are you doing?
Stan
How do you guys make them so yummy?
Kyle
I don't know.
McDonald's Exec
[hiding in some bushes with the other execs] You'd BETTER get him to tell you or you're getting shot in the back of the head! [The Chick-fil-A exec has a sniper's gun trained on Stan's head. Stan is wearing an ear piece] You got that?!
Stan
[panicking, but with great restraint] Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
Kyle
Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
Stan
No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
Kyle
[rolls his eyes] Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
McDonald's Exec
Oh, right. Like a friend would walk out on somebody who was diagnosed with a serious illness!
Stan
Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
Kyle
You said "fuck you" to my face, Stan.
Stan
Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
McDonald's Exec
Oh yeah, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back.
Kyle
Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
McDonald's Exec
[comes out of the bushes and goes to the stand] Goddamnit this is getting us nowhere! [the other execs follow him onto the sidewalk] Everyone get back! Do you wanna play hardball?! That's fine! [the Chick-fil-A exec wields his gun and the kids scream and scatter. The McDonald's exec goes to the Secret Last Process Booth] All right, let's see this mighty machine once and for all! [before he can see anything, he's gunned down by the drunken research center/Matrix members, who then start firing away indiscriminately with their semi-automatics]
Morpheus
[dispatching the Taco Bell exec] You vampire sons of bitches! [the Chick-fil-A, Burger King and Subway execs go down, then the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell execs]
Neo
Haha! [accidentally shoots himself in the head and goes down]
Morpheus
Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!
Stan
Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
Mr. Mathers
Uh oh, looks like the serum is wearing off! [whips out a glass and a bottle of whiskey] Here, you'd better take some more! [pours the whiskey in the glass]
Stan
No, I'm done with that! [slaps it away from the member's hand]
Morpheus
But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!
Stan
I don't want everything to go back to the way it was! [suddenly calm] I, I don't. [he steps over the broken bottle, leaves and joins the other kids, who have returned] You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town. [approaches one boy] Maybe this kid will become my new best friend. [then another] Or maybe this kid will.
Douglas
Wow. [smiles]
Stan
Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. [a horn and the sound of wheels stopping are heard]
Randy
[in the U-Haul truck] Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!
Stan
[his face drops] What?
Randy
We worked it out, pal. Surprise!
Stan
No, dad, no. No, please!
At the apartment, Stan's room, day. Sharon and Stan talk
Sharon
[somber and unsure] We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...
Stan
No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
Sharon
People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.
"Landslide" plays again, with everything going in reverse. The realtor removes the sign she had placed in front of the Marsh house. The Marsh family moves back in. Randy and Sharon work together to take the sofa back inside while Shelly carries her own box. Sharon sets up Stan's room again almost as he had it before they moved. Randy carries in another box of Stan's stuff. Stan looks out over the neighborhood from his window... which was apparently across from Cartman's house all this time, for he sees Cartman Burger and the crowd of kids and adults across the street.
Kyle
You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
Crowd
Eeewww!
The sitting president, who is a duck, is removed and Barack Obama resumes his presidency. In his backyard, Randy Marsh makes a small bonfire of all his Steamy Ray Vaughn stuff. At Stark's Pond, Wendy and Stan share a picnic, but he's not interested enough to puke on her. At the dinner table, Stan isn't eating, but looks down and away. Finally, in his bedroom, the radio wakes him up at 7 AM., like always. His favorite morning show comes back on
Big Harry
I like that!
Mike
Yeah.
Big Harry
Big Harry and Mike in the Morning, talkin' about Two and a Half Men. I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen, Mike.
Mike
Yeah, but what about that movie Dolphin Tale? I am psyched for that!
Big Harry
Dolphin Tale, Big Harry and Mike in the Morning. [Stan sits up] Let's hear one from the band Slamjammer and their song- [Stan turns the radio off. There's a knock on his door]
Kyle
[enters with Cartman and Kenny] Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
Cartman
The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! [they walk back out and away.]
Stan
...K, coming. [hops out of bed and puts on his coat, going through the motions. He walks out to join the boys, but a few seconds later he returns to open a drawer, pull out a bottle of whiskey, opens it, takes a swig of it, closes it, and puts it back in the drawer. He doesn't bother to put on his shoes. He closes the drawer and heads back into the hall]
End of Ass Burgers

The Last of the Meheecans
Cartman's backyard, day. By the fence, Cartman , wearing a ranger hat and outfit, and some other boys in similar attire, have erected a small U.S. border with a sign saying "Welcome to Texas" on it. The sign also has an outline of the State of Texas on it. Cartman is patrolling the border with DogPoo and Jason. They are holding Super-Soakers and pop-guns, plastic forks are duct-taped to the fence. Cartman scans for illegals with his binoculars
Cartman
[turns around] Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready. [spits something out, wipes his lips clean with the back of his shirt sleeve, and returns to patrolling the border] There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
Liane
[walking out] Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa?
Cartman
Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah! [turns to the boys on the ground - Clyde, Craig, and Timmy] All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!
The other four
Yeehaw! [Timmy stays silent]
In the woods nearby, Butters leads five other boys in a plot to get past the US border at Cartman's house - Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Jimmy, and Token
Butters
Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
Stan
Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
Butters
[saddened] Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?
Stan
You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
Kyle
Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
Back at the border, Cartman scans the surrounding area, making sound effects while doing so
Cartman
[robot voice] Scanning for Mexicans. [more sound effects] Oh! [He spots Kyle coming out of the woods] We've got a Mexican! [Clyde and Craig take up posts]
Kyle
Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
Cartman
[to the other boys] He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid. [to Kyle] Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
Kyle
Better than being a fat-ass Texan!
Cartman
Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
Kyle
No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
Cartman
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew! [Stan sneaks in past a cardboard box labelled "Christmas Ornaments"] Let's just see you try and-!
Stan
Base! [the others turn to see Stan in their midst]
Cartman
Clyde?! [descends from his perch atop the border and goes to Clyde] The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
Clyde
I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
Cartman
Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit! [Token appears at the other end of the border and hops over] If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
Token
Base!
Cartman
Dude!! [walks over to Craig] How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
Craig
I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
Cartman
Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! [Jimmy walks by in the foreground]
Jimmy
Eh, b-base.
Cartman
Oh God! [throws down his hat]
Cartman's house, evening. All the boys are at the dining table eating dinner. Well, all but one. All of the ones present are laughing. Well, all but one.
Stan
So, so then, so then the pope says, "Maybe you should go check the toilet." [most of the other boys laugh]
Craig
Hey. Hey, I got one. [the other get quiet] Why do girls wear makeup and perfume?
Token
Why?
Craig
'Cause they're ugly and they stink. [most of the other boys laugh]
Stan
Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
Cartman
I'm not pouting! I've just heard all these jokes before!
Kyle
So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
Cartman
At least I have an asshole, Kyle! [the boys laugh]
As the boys enjoy themselves, the camera pulls back into the woods outside where it has begun to snow, far away we find one boy, shivering, sitting by a stream with a jug of water next to him, in this cold snowy night.
Butters
[thinking to himself] Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: "Go that way." How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
"The Last of the Meheecans" appears onscreen after the camera pans up into the sky
Butters
[wanders around] Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border! [walks further away, and finds a road. He walks along the shoulder and shivers as he sings]
Lalala, lalala, Work Meheecan Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Meheecan Work.

[A couple in a car drive up behind him]
Woman
Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse.
Man
It sure is. I-I can barely see. [Butters turns around and the woman suddenly sees him]</i></poem>
Woman
Oh my God look out it's a Mexican! [the man loses control and hits Butters, who simply tumbles off the car and onto the shoulder, face down. The couple stops the car and goes to check on Butters. The wife turns him over]
Man
Oh my God, are you alright?
Butters
Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. M-mis amigos, my a-, my amigos are waiting.
Man
Poor thing must have snuck across the border and then lost track of his family.
Butters
I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
The couple's house, night. There's something about the Spanish Colonial architecture in this house. The couple shows Butters to a spare room full of inspirational and religious messages. He will sleep here for the night
Woman
[showing him around the room] Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay. [kneels before him] Do you understand?
Man
Darling, I don't know if we can keep him.
Woman
What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?! [to Butters] Win-dow. Wiinnn-dow.
Man
Yep, window.
Woman
[pleased] Bueno! [to her husband] He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico! [to Butters] Window. Windooow. [gives him a bottle of] Win-dex. Wiiin-dex, Mantequilla. Paper towel. [squirts some Windex onto the towel and takes Butters to the window] Sí, sí Mantequilla [shows Butters how to clean the window, then leaves him to continue doing it himself]
Man
Auhp, be sure to get the edges.
Woman
Oh darling, it's wonderful.
Cartman's house, night. The boys have gone to sleep in the basement, the TV is now white noise and static, food, toys, video and board games litter the floor. Everyone is soundly asleep, sprawled out randomly atop pillows and sleeping bags, Timmy in his wheelchair, the camera zooms out to reveal Cartman tossing and turning in his sleeping bag.
Cartman
[talking in his sleep] No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got... [wakes up] Butters! [gets up, then tries to get the others up] Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!
Stan
What are you talking about?
Cartman
Where is Butters?
Kyle
[after a few seconds] He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
Stan
Yeah, I think he was? Wait.
Craig
Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
Outside Cartman's house, night. The boys turn on the patio light and walk out through the sliding doors in back the snow is starting to cover the yard.
Kyle
Butters?
Stan
Butters!
Kyle
[hugs himself] Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.
Cartman
[puts on his ranger hat, now speaking in his Texan voice] All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through! [walks towards the woods, but stops long enough to tell Kyle] You haven't won yet! [smiles evilly and moves on] Game on!
Craig
Game on!
Kyle
Wugh, game on. [puts on his mustache]
The couple's house, Morning. Butters is wearing a hairnet, washing dishes and humming to himself. His face is filthy.
Butters
Work, Mexican, Work. [hums some more] Work, Mexican, Work

Woman
[arrives at the kitchen entrance] Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. [leaves. Butters follows her out]
The living room. A large box wrapped up and tied with a bow sits in the middle
Man
Surprise! We've scraped some money together and got you something. [Butters grins]
Woman
It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente.
Butters
Wow! A present just for me? [starts to unwrap it]
Woman
Oh he's such a happy little Mexican. [Butters finishes unwrapping it only to see a gas-powered leaf blower designed to be worn on the back]
Man
How do you like that, Mantequilla? Your very own leaf blower! Hahah, I have no idea how it works, but I'm sure you do, huh. Say, how'd you like to go in the back yard and play? [moments later, Butters is in the back yard using the power blower to blow some leaves around. The couple watch him from a table with umbrella providing shade]
Woman
Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy.
Man
Hup. Nono, Mantequilla! You're just blowing the leaves from one side to the other. Get them in one pile so you can use the garbage bags we loaned you.
Butters
Ah, sí señor.
Woman
Oh he's so adorable.
A song begins to play as Butters clears away the leaves. As the song plays, you see the following montage: Butters blowing leaves into piles, Butters washing he couple's care as they watch, Butters scooping leaves out of the pool as the couple plays in it with a beach ball, the boys pasting fliers all over town asking "Have you seen this Mexican? Answers to 'Mantequilla.' Text *** 67319," Cartman and his border patrol watching for illegal aliens, Butters providing pedicures for the couple, Butters serving them ham, Butters washing more dishes, Stan and Kyle putting up billboards that echo what the fliers said, and Cartman looking into the woods. Seeing no one coming, Cartman lowers his binoculars and smiles. Butters now clean up the front yard.

The couple's kitchen, later. The woman is at the breakfast nook crying and wiping away her tears with a tissue. The man sees her and gets worried, then walks into the kitchen.
Man
Honey? Honey, what's wrong? [she looks up to see him]
Woman
It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the windows, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said "I need to go home." I tried telling him "your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!" But I don't think he feels it.
Man
Well, maybe if we let him paint the garage, he'll feel more like family and then-
Woman
No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!
El Pollo Loco, night. The couple drive up to El Pollo Loco and take Butters to the door. The woman is still weeping
Brian
Come on, honey. [they walk back to the car]
Butters
Hey, where are you going?
Woman
[turns around] No! Mantequilla bad! Go now!
Butters
Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
Woman
No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! [they reach the car, get in, and drive off. The woman is still weeping]
El Pollo Loco kitchen. Butters is sitting atop a prep table telling of his adventure, as a group of Latino workers go about making meals
Butters
So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! [the workers all stop in shock and look at him, a utensil can be heard hitting the floor]
Worker 1
Mantequilla?
Worker 2
Mantequilla?
Worker 1
¡Yo he escuchado de este niño! ¡He visto anuncios de el por donde quiera! ["I've HEARD of this kids! I've seen POSTERS and BILLBOARDS of him everywhere!"]
Worker 3
Sí. Es famoso! ["Yeah. He's FAMOUS!"]
Butters
Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
Worker 1
¿Un niño gringo que quiere ses mexicano? ["A WHITE American kid who wants to be Mexican?"]
Worker 3
Ay, tiempos han cambiado. ["Wow, times are really changing"]
Worker 1
No... no. ¿Saben qué? Mantequilla tiene derecho. ¿Por qué venimos a este país? ¡Vale madre aquí, 'mano! ["No... no, you know what? Mantequilla is RIGHT! Why did we even come to this country? It SUCKS HERE, MAN!"]
Butters
Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
Worker 1
Debemos escuchar a este niño. ¡Mexico es mucho mejor que esto! ["We should listen to this kid. Mexico is better than this!"]
Butters
All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
Worker 1
Todos mis amigos están allí también.. ["All my amigos are back there too."]
Worker 2
¡A la chingada con esto! ¡Vamonos! ["Come on, screw this! Let's go!"]
Worker 3
Sí, ¡vamonos a la chingada!
Butters
Viva la Meheeco!
A hospital, outside. An elderly man is being assisted by two Latinos, who are helping him out of an ambulance and onto a wheelchair
Doctor
Alright, let's get him into ER.
Elderly Man
Careful w'my foot! [a car stops and a man whistles]
Worker 2
¡Oye Yimenez! ¡Nos vamos a regresar, hombre! ["Hey Yimenez!!! We're going back, man!"]
Yimenez
¿Qué? ["What?"]
Worker 2
¡Este lugar es una mierda! ¡Nos regresamos a Mexico!["This place sucks! We're going back to Mexico!"]
Butters
We're crossin' the border!
Yimenez
¡Jose! ¡Martinez! Nos vamos para atras para Mexico! ["We're going back to Mexico!" The nurses and other Hispanic workers pour out of the hospital]
Butters
Olé!
The real Mexican border, day. There's no activity. One of the guards is looking through binoculars, the other larger guard is fanning himself with a rolled up newspaper
Border Officer 1
Pretty quiet out there.
Border Officer 2
Yeah, a bit too quiet if you ask me. Gimme those! [takes the binoculars and looks through them]
Border Officer 1
Just seems like Mexicans don't try to cross into the US as much as they used to, you know?
Border Officer 2
Noo, they're out there, Charlie. Plottin' their next move. They'll do anything they can to get into the Land of Opportunity. [lowers the binoculars. The first illegals appear on the US side of the border and head towards the fence] And as long as this country offers everyone a better life, there's gonna be people clamorin' to get it. It's the curse of success, Charlie. [more aliens appear as the first ones hop over the fence] A great and wealthy nation will always be plagued [raises the binoculars and looks through them again] by the needy tryin' to-what the hell? [sees the Mexicans running into Mexico. The other guard notices too]
Charlie
[scratches his head] Uhh, sir? Aren't them Mexicans runnin' into Mexico?
Border Officer 2
[lowers his binoculars] That don't make sense.
Charlie
[shouting to the returning illegals] You're going the wrong way!
TV News break
Anchorman
You've heard of Mexican salsa, but Mexican pride? The phenomenon is called "Orgullo de Mantequilla," where Mexicans are realizing it actually is starting to suck more here in the US. The borders are being flooded with Latin Americans trying to get back to their own countries. [Randy and Sharon are on the sofa watching the news]
Randy
Well, I think it's good. [stands up and puts on his blazer, then walks to the front door] If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy. [opens the door and looks outside. Huge piles of leaves have been left on his front yard] NOOOOOO! [Audio clip is Darth Vader's voice from Star Wars Ep. III]
Cartman's house, day. He's watching the news too
Anchorman
But just what has sparked the Mexican desire to live... in Mexico? Joining us now is economist Mark Geiger, and Mark, we've heard of Mexican ice cream, but Mexican patriotism?
Mr. Geiger
Yes, it's a very odd phenomenon, Chris. Ih it just- [the front door opens and it's Stan and Kyle, who are pretty miffed for obvious reasons]
Kyle
Cartman, what the hell is this?! [he's holding a poster Cartman designed: "Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol. Permission to shoot on sight."]
Cartman
You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
Kyle
"Wanted by the U.S. Border Patrol"?! "Permission to shoot on sight"?!
Cartman
You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
Kyle
Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
Cartman
Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?[The news come back on, with Cartman glancing at his TV, with Kyle also staring, as Stan continues glaring at Cartman]
Chris
Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
Cartman
Oh dude. Sweet.
Butters is asleep in a room, on a wooden bed. The floor is made of hexagon-shaped tile. On the cracked green wall behind him is a small framed painting of Frida Kahlo. He wakes up, gets off the bed, looks around, and walks towards a doorway completely naked except for his Mexico hat. He opens the double doors and steps outside. He rubs his eyes to get a better view. A small plaza full of people awaits his appearance, and everyone cheers
Crowd
¡Vamos Mantequilla! [Clap clap clap-clap-clap] ¡Vamos Mantequilla! [Clap clap clap-clap-clap] ¡Vamos Mantequilla! [Clap clap clap-clap-clap]
Butters
Oh uh, I'm sorry, [opens his arms wide] I don't really-
Crowd
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. [he lowers his arms and the crowd quiets down. He raises them up and] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. [he raises his right arm] ¡Oy! [he lowers his arm and raises it a little] ¡Oy! [now raises his left arm] ¡Orgullo! [opens his arms wide] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. [the crowd members raise their arms and some begin to toss their hats in the air]
Butters
Wow.
The U.S. border. Officer 2 briefs the new volunteers on their duties
Border Officer 2
Welcome to the US Border Patrol. You volunteers are the key to keepin' this country safe and prosperous. [begins to walk back and forth] Every day, more and more Mexicans are tryin' to get past this fence and go back to their homes in Mexico. As border patrol officers our duty is to stop Mexicans from crossin' the border. We don't need to worry about the semantics of which direction they're going, we're just supposed to stop them! [pounds his left fist into his right hand] Marcus?
Marcus
The standard-issue border patrol weapon is the P-29 stun baton. [begins handing a baton to each volunteer] It carries a 4000 watt charge and is your best option for enforcin' border patrol law.
Cartman
This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
Marcus
The baton is non-lethal, but powerful e-
Border Officer 3
Hey! We got some! Mexicans at 2 o'clock! [hands his binoculars over to Officer 2]
Border Officer 2
Let's get ready, recruits! Must be a couple dozen of them! [Cartman takes out his own binoculars and begins scanning and providing his own sound effects] This is the US Border Patrol! Stop where you are! Turn around and get back to work!
Marcus
There's too many of 'em! We're gonna need backup! [Cartman goes to a nearby water truck and opens a spigot, which releases water and creates a large puddle. The Mexicans run into the puddle and stand there. Cartman tosses his baton into the puddle, electrocuting the Mexicans.]
Border Officer 2
You're pretty good at stoppin' Mexicans, son. What's your name?
Cartman
Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
San Francisco, Later. The Mexicans are rounded up and taken to San Francisco to be released. What follows is a montage parody of Border Wars: first, shots of a border crossing showing four lanes of cars waiting to get into Mexico. A U-Haul truck is opened up and its cargo of Mexicans is removed from the trailer. A nighttime patrol shows Cartman with some other officers in a boat. They intercept a smaller boat with Mexicans trying to row to Mexico, then escort them back to shore near Santa Monica. The third shot shows Cartman on a helicopter with two other officers. He points at a sign on the ground. The helicopter drops him off near the sign and he turns it around to fool unsuspecting Mexicans, grins, and hides behind some bushes. Some Mexicans stand in line to get unemployment checks, and one of them gets a flag from Officer 2
Narrator
Dedicated. Patriotic. Tireless. These are the men and women of the US Border Patrol. They work around the clock protecting America's prosperity. They are the front line in making sure Mexicans stay here and work. The border patrol is uncompromising, diligent, and kewl. They will defend, arrest, and most importantly, let the Mexicans know that they are way better off here in the United States.
Días De Mantequilla. Butters has earned himself a festival - Butters Day - in what looks like Mexico City, complete with mariachis and a portrait of him mimicking the famous portrait of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Among the sights at this festival: little kids dancing, señoritas dancing nearby, a man wearing a large papier-mâché Mantequilla head is entertaining children, people are buying Mantequilla shirts at the Tienda de Orgullo, kids trying to burst open a piñata of Mantequilla. A girl runs by with a small Mexican flag. One of the kids breaks open the piñata and the others rush in for the candy.
President Calderón
¡Hoy celebramos el primer día de Mantequilla, honrando el espiritu de México! ["Today we celebrate the FIRST day of Mantequilla, honoring the spirit of Mexico!" Everyone claps for Butters]
Butters
Thanks everyone. [hops onto the table] It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos. [gets sad] It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
President Calderón
Mantequilla, tu tienes que hacer una decisión. Los Estados Unidos están de baja, y claro, México pronto será el mejor lugar. Pero como Mexicanos, nosotros sabemos que nada es más importante que la famlia, y amistades. Estás invitado a vivir con nosotros, Mantequilla, pero tienes que seguir tu corazón. ¿Quieres quedarte aquí con nosotros, o quieres estar con tus amigos? ["Mantequilla, you have a decision to make. The United States is on the decline, and clearly, Mexico will quickly become the better place to be. But as we Mexicans know, nothing is more important than FAMILY and FRIENDS. You are welcome to live with us, Mantequilla, but you must follow your heart. Do you want to stay here with us, or do you want to go back to your amigos?"]
Butters
[aside to the Mexican sitting at the table with him] ...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
The US Border. Cartman stands front and center scanning the horizon, with other soldiers and volunteers taking breaks.
Cartman
[robot voice] No Mexicans detected. [normally] Huh, nothing.
Border Officer 4
[Richards] Let's face it: they've just about all gotten back across. No matter how hard we tried, the Mexicans all got across the border.
Border Officer 2
When we asked Obama to stop illegal immigrants, we didn't mean to make the US so shitty they wouldn't wanna come anymore.
Marcus
[along in the lookout tower, as bored as the others, he suddenly sees something, sits up, and rushes to tell the others.] Hey! Hey wait a minute! [whips out his binoculars and gets a better look.] It's a Mexican! [It's Mantequilla] I think he wants to come back in! [Officer 2 climbs the ladder and gets a better look]
Border Officer 2
Oh my God it is! [puts down the binoculars and happily waves his hat at Butters] Hey! Hey! Come on in! [bangs at the tower and whistles] Come on! Come on! Come on, it's okay! [Butters draws closer, smiling. guard 2 addressed the other officers and volunteers] The fuck are you doing?! Get that gate open! [an officer and a volunteer happily oblige. The other officers and volunteers are smiling too]
Border Officer 5
Come on, buddy!
Other Officers
Come on now, come on! You've got it. [Cartman gets up on the tower and uses his own binoculars]
Cartman
Wait a minute, isn't that...
Butters
[looking back at him] Game on!
Cartman
[squints his eyes] Oh no you don't! [takes Officer 2's sidearm and fires at Butters.]
Butters
[dodging the bullets] AAAH!
Border Officer 2
[takes his weapon back] Fuck are you doin'?!
Cartman
That asshole is not getting across my border! [Butters either fails to see the open gate, or it was closed while Cartman was firing at him, because he starts climbing the fence. Cartman quickly gets down to intercept him, but decides that electrocuting the fence would get Butters off it, and it works]
Butters
AAAAH! [falls and gets up] I'll get over! [runs farther away from the tower]
Cartman
[gives chase] No you won't Butters!
Butters
[sees a gray burro and jumps up on him] Giddy up! [gallops away. Cartman gets on a pale gray burro and whistles, and gallops after Butters]
Mexico City, day. The Mexicans have huddled around just one radio and are listening to the play-by-play provided by a commentator. Since the Spanish lines are not translated here, I will provide them
Commentator
Un otro shoto de Mantequilla. Y Manteque-ah. ¡Oh! ¡Una arma! Una arma del El Niño Gordo! ["Another shot of Mantequilla! And Mantequi-ah. Oh! A firearm! The fat kid's firearm!" Apparently Cartman was firing at Butters]
Mexicans
Ohhh!
The US Border. Butters and Cartman ride past the tower, and Cartman finds himself fired upon. He turns and sees the border patrol after him
Cartman
Ey!
Mexico City.
Commentator
Mantequilla ayudar ¡1a Border Patrol! ["The Border Patrol is coming to Mantequilla's aid!" The Mexicans cheer]
El Río Bravo. Butters is now speeding away in a small boat, and Cartman is chasing him in a Border Patrol boat.
Cartman
¡Respeto mi autóridad! ["Respect mah authoritah!" Again, Cartman is fired upon, and his boat begins to sink. This time, the border patrol is in a helicopter firing away]
Mexico City.
Commentator
Border Patrol pegaron ¡El Cero Gordo! ["The border patrol hit the Fat Zero!" Next, Cartman is on an ATV and stops to look for Butters]
The US Border.
Cartman
Where the fuck did he go?! [in the background, Butters can be seen riding by on his burro. Cartman sees him and gives chase. Just before Cartman reaches him, Butters blinks. Cartman jumps off his ATV and tackles Butters off his burro, and they both end up on the desert ground, with Cartman on top] Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose! [Butters apparently collapses] The fuck is this?! [instead of seeing the real Butters, Cartman sees a life-size piñata of him. The head separates from the body and candy falls out] No. NO! [Butters is climbing the fence]
Butters
[taunting] Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!
Cartman
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! [Butters goes over the border fence and jumps down]
Butters
Base! [dances around with his arms outstretched]
Mexicans
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [Butters gets on his knees and slides into a pose]
Commentator
El mirito, vinto! [the Mexicans celebrate. The border patrol celebrates as well, and Butters dances, the "Mexican Hat Dance" starts playing]
Cartman's dining room, evening. The boys are back at the table eating dinner, with Butters sitting between Craig and Kyle. The boys are laughing and telling jokes to each other
Butters
So then, so then the fireman says "That won't even fit in my scrotum!" [the boys laugh again]
Kyle
[noticing Cartman] Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
Cartman
I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
Butters
Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
Stan
Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
Kyle
Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. [everyone falls silent. Butters stands up on his chair and raises his arms slowly]
Mexicans
[responding to his gesture] ¡Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... [A baby responds to it, as do three Mexican fisherman out at sea. Craig and Kyle look all around, and then at Butters. Butters thrusts his right arm out twice.] ¡Oy! ¡Oy! [Butters thrusts his left arm out once] ¡Orgullo! [raises both arms again] ¡Maaantequilla! [now all his friends are looking at him]
Cartman
[Sighs gruffly and rolls his eyes] A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
End of The Last of the Meheecans

Bass to Mouth
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallway. Butters walks with Kenny, Stan and Kyle are at their lockers, and Cartman comes into view at the far end of the hallway
Cartman
YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys! [runs up to Butters, Kenny, Stan, and Kyle] You're never gonna guess what! [stands among them] Seriously you guys, guess what??
Stan
What?
Cartman
You guys, you know Pete Melman? [no one answers] Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
Kyle
The blond kid?
Cartman
Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
Stan
What about him?
Cartman
He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! [begins to cackle]
Kyle
[angry] How do you know?!
Cartman
Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
Butters
Eavesdropper?
Kyle
What's that?
Cartman
Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper? [whips out an iPhone and starts looking for the Eavesdropper article] It's a Web site about all the students in the school! [The web site screams "Exclusive! Pete Melman Craps Pants At School!" at you. Part of the page has a picture of Pete on there, with a 'play' button to play a recording]
Clyde
[appears at the far end of the hallway] Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! [runs off to tell others]
Cartman
Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys! [gets back to his phone] Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom. [touches the 'play' button] Just listen, listen listen.
Nurse Bronski
Hello Mrs. Melman, this is the school nurse. I'm afraid your son has had a little accident. [Cartman snickers quietly]
Mrs. Melman
Oh no, what is it? Is he okay?
Stan
Turn it up. [Cartman obliges]
Nurse Bronski
No no, it's not serious, but he went number two during class. [Cartman grins big, Butters grins a little, Kyle is a little disgusted] I'm afraid he's gonna need a new pair of pants and underwear, and a clean pair of socks.
Craig
Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper?
Cartman
Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! [laughs. Craig moves on]
Kyle
Dude, that's so wrong!
Butters
[moves off] Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
Cartman
Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, "Poopypants Pete", but th- but then I also thought of "Mushpants Melman."
Mr. Mackey
[over the PA system] Attention South Park Students: will the following students report to the Principal's office immediately? Eric Cartman? Thank you.
Cartman
Oh Jesus, what now?! [goes to the office]
Principal's office, faculty room. Cartman sits at one end of the faculty table while Principal Victoria sits at the other end, flanked by Mr. Mackey on her right and Mr. Adler on her left. The clock reads 2:03 p.m.
Principal Victoria
Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.
Cartman
Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! [slaps the table and laughs]
Principal Victoria
Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.
Cartman
Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
Principal Victoria
Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?
Cartman
[smiles] Yeah, he killed himself.
Mr. Mackey
Yes, and the reason he killed himself, Eric, was that the ridicule and the torment from other students, [points] spearheaded by you, cause him-!
Cartman
Hey! Whoooa.
Mr. Mackey
Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.
Cartman
'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
Mr. Adler
Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete.
Principal Victoria
Please just let it go.
Cartman
You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
Mr. Mackey
We are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, Eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!
Cartman
Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
Principal Victoria
[stands up and walks to the window, then looks out] Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.
Cartman
[scoff] Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
Principal Victoria
If Pete Melman does not kill himself, [turns around] we will make it very worth your while.
Cartman
You aren't listing to anythin- [checks himself] Make it worth my while how?
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallway again. Must be a rainy day, as some of the kids are eating lunches in the hall. Butters, Craig, and Stan walk towards the camera, with Craig looking at his iPhone. The three are laughing. Kyle appears and approaches them
Stan
No way.
Kyle
What's up?
Stan
The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
Kyle
Dude, that's fucked up.
Stan
Come on dude, it's pretty funny.
Kyle
It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
Stan
Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.
Butters
It's megasuperhilarious! [a girl is putting her books away when Cartman approaches her]
Cartman
Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
Jenny
What do you want?!
Cartman
Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
Jenny
[gets her bag lunch, closes her locker and walks away] Yeah, it's gross! [Cartman stands by her locker for a moment, then catches up to her]
Cartman
So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. [takes out a box of cupcakes from his backpack]
Jenny
[unimpressed] So what?
Cartman
I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of... [gulps] liked you.
Jenny
I don't like you!
Cartman
I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake? [getting uncomfortable, he puts the cupcake in the box and the box away in his back pack] Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. [walks quickly away]
Jenny
Hey. Wait. [Cartman stops and Jenny catches up] Look, I'm sorry. That was mean. I'd love to try one of your mom's cupcakes.
Fourth grade, Mr. Garrison's class. The kids have all taken their seats. Mr. Garrison is going over a test on sea life.
Mr. Garrison
And now number 17 many of you got wrong as well. The correct answer was D, whales are mammals. [Jenny gets a sharp pain in her stomach]
Jenny
Oh! Gahhh. Ohf.
Mr. Garrison
They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
Cartman
[concerned, while Mr. Garrision is talking] You okay, Jenny?
Jenny
Yeah, I'm fine, I just- Awwgh! [can't stand it much longer] M-Mr. Garrison? Can I please [winces] be excused?
Cartman
Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. [Jenny moans even more]
Mr. Garrison
What's the matter?
Jenny
Gah I just need to go to the restroom!
Mr. Garrison
Well okay.
Cartman
Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
Jenny
Please! I've gotta go now!
Cartman
Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
Jenny
[leaves her seat] No, Mr. Garrison, I've gotta- go- AAAH! [lets out a wet fart]
Class
Eeeeww! [Jenny can't hold it in. Bebe and Stan leave their seats while Cartman stands on his desk]
Cartman
Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants! [Millie, Token, and Wendy leave] Did you hear that?! [Kyle and Clyde leave] It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
Kids
Ew!
Butters
Sick!
Cartman
WAY worse!
Timmy
Run. [Jenny begins to bawl]
Principal's office faculty lounge. Mr. Adler, Principal Victoria, and Mr. Mackey have gathered again to meet with Cartman. Silence fills the room
Principal Victoria
...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
Cartman
Alright, kewl.
Mr. Mackey
[shoots back] No, not cool! M'kay, she's on suicide watch, Eric! She's given up on life!
Cartman
You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! [shows them the story on his iPhone]
Principal Victoria
[shoving her chair aside. It falls to the floor] That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!
Cartman
Nobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
The three adults
Yes!
Cartman
Jesus Christ! [thinks hard] Okay, okay. [squeezes his eyes shut, puts his hands over them, removes the right hand] Um, Jesus- [removes the left hand] ah... Okay, look. [the adults lean in a bit] Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
Mr. Mackey
Our students did average, maybe just below average.
Cartman
Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you... [turns his head left for a moment, still hasn't opened his eyes] you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. [Victoria, Adler, and Mackey just stare at him]
Principal Victoria
That's insane!
Cartman
Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? [Mr. Adler looks at Principal Victoria, Principal Victoria looks at Mr. Mackey, Mr. Mackey places a call.]
Mr. Mackey
Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.
The school hallway, day. Butters, Craig and Stan are laughing at another Eavesdropper headline as Kyle rounds the corner behind them. Kyle walks up to them
Stan
Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her "soft-serve Simon."
Kyle
That's not funny.
Craig
Hey, here's a post about Token: "Token Black's Private Gym Photos" [laughs]
Kyle
[rolls his eyes] I'm not looking at that!
Stan
Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!
Kyle
It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
Stan
I wouldn't care.
Craig
Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.
Stan
What?
Craig
"In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'."
Stan
[sees Kenny and walks up to him at his locker] Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!
Kenny
(What?)
Stan
How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
Kenny
(I don't know.)
Stan
Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
Kenny
(No!)
Stan
That was a private e-mail from me to you! [notices a pissed-off Wendy approaching] Hey Wendy.
Wendy
You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!
Kenny
(Oh fuck I'm gettin' out of here!) [closes his locker and leaves]
Stan
No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
Wendy
Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! [Stan leans away a bit]
Stan
Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
Wendy
So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! [Stan stays silent]
South Park Elementary Library. Stan has convened a meeting of some of his classmates and is now at the podium
Stan
This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all! [The others present are Red, Kenny, Butters, Craig (looking at his iPhone), Wendy, Kyle, Bebe, and Token. Kyle raises his hand] Yes, Kyle.
Kyle
So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
Stan
Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
Wendy
Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack. [Butters laughs at Wendy's wisecrack in a weird way]
Stan
Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room! [the other eight look at each other] Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch! [pounds the podium with his fists] And we're not gonna-!
Craig
[reading off his iPhone] It's not somebody in this room.
Stan
What? How do you know?
Craig
Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: "Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker." [laughs] Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.
Kyle
Where is it coming from?
Craig
Huh?
Kyle
If it's on the school network we can track the IP address. [takes Craig's iPhone and sets about tracing the IP address. The kids head into the hallway and pass by the music room] This way. In here. [they stop at the music room door] Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
Stan
We only have music class on Thursday.
Wendy
Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
Kyle
Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
Stan
Oh I'm ready!
Kyle
One. [Stan makes fists and tenses up] Two. Three! [opens the door and the nine kids run in, but they're all surprised at what they see. It's a gerbil typing away into the Eavesdropper Web site. This week on Spee: Jenny Simons Still On Suicide Watch]
Craig
It's a rat! [the gerbil noticed them and runs away]
Kyle
Get it! [the kids give chase. Craig and Kyle run into each other and fall trying to get the gerbil. Bebe and Token fall giving chase]
Stan
Don't let him get away!
Token
He's gone!
Stan
What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
Kyle
Wikileaks. [Kyle is now at the computer looking at the login screen] It says here his name is Wikileaks.
A boy's bedroom, full of panda stuff. On the boy's desk is a cage with a gerbil in it - Lemmiwinks. He runs in his wheel for a while, then steps off it for a sip of water. When he's done, the Frog King appears before him
Frog King
Lemmiwinks! I come with news of great gravity. Another rodent is out there, spreading terrible rumors and hacking e-mails. [Lemmiwinks makes some noises] Yes. And I'm afraid the ne
ws is worse. The creature doing this, Lemmiwinks, is your brother, Wikileaks!

Singer
Wikileaks, the bum hacker with a heart of doom.
Everyone knows the gerbil king, but no one ever speaks
Of Lemminwinks's brother, the evil Likiweaks...

Frog King
Once again Wikileaks is trying to wreak havoc on our world. Only you can stop him, Lemmiweaks.
Singer
Lemmiwinks, King of Gerbils, stop your brother of doom!

South Park Elementary, hallway. Two girls chat by some lockers
Emily
It's just so embarrassing. What if the other girls find out my mother is in rehab?
Tammy Nelson
It's okay Emily. Can I tell you a secret? My mom has a drinking problem too. [above them, Wikileaks is recording everything they say]
Emily
Really? You too?
Tammy Nelson
That's just between us, okay?
Emily
Of course, Tammy. I'm really glad I shared this with you. [Stan and his gang spot Wikileaks]
Stan
Stop that rat! [Wikileaks jumps off the lockers and runs for the computer lab]
The Computer Lab, moments later. Wikileaks jumps onto the first computer he sees, logs in, and starts typing in his latest headline: "TAMMY NELSON AND JEN MARX 'HELP!' OUR MOMS ARE VICIOUS DRUNKS!¡" The gang catches up to Wikileaks
Stan
Knock it off! [Wikileaks hops off and heads for the nearest air vent, and makes his escape]
The school library. A boy is typing into his iPhone
Tommy Edwards
I just want you to know that I have a hure crush on you and- [Wikileaks runs by and snatches the phone away in his teeth] HEY! [Wikileaks runs to the nearest computer, logs in, and types in the latest headline: "TOMMY EDWARDS HAS A CRUSH ON MARLA WATKINS" Butters looks in and spots Wikileaks. Wikileaks notices him]
Butters
NO Wikileaks! Bad!
The school cafeteria, at that moment. In the kitchen Mr. Adler, Principal Victoria, Cartman, and Mr. Mackey add Ease-Lax laxatives to the pizzas just brought in from Pizza Hut
Cartman
Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
Mr. Mackey
Eh, Is this one good?
Cartman
Yeah, I think they're all ready.
Principal Victoria
You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?
Cartman
It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
Mr. Mackey
Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.
Cartman
Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?! [leaves the preparation table and faces them] I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
Mr. Mackey
Alright, fine. Bring her in, Adler. [Mr. Adler leaves, then returns with a grinning Selena Gomez]
Cartman
Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You [gasp] you actually got her to come! [grins]
Selena Gomez
Hi Eric. I understand you really wanted to meet me. Wanna get a picture together?
Cartman
No thanks. Okay, proceed.
Mr. Mackey
I/m sorry about this, Ms. Gomez. [Mr. Mackey punches her on the stomach twice. Cartman is awed, then smiles. Principal Victoria then smashes Gomez on the head with a baking tray] Alright, get her the fuck out of here. [Mr. Adler hauls Ms. Gomes away.]
Principal Victoria
Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?
Cartman
That. Was. Amazing.
Mr. Mackey
Alright now, get back to class! Adler, get rid of those laxative bottles! Trash all the Arby's horsey sauce packages too! There cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here! [they hear some small gerbil sounds] What the? [notices Likiweaks on a shelf recording the action] Oh shit! [Wikiweaks runs away] Stop that rat!
The boy's bedroom, day. Lemmiwinks is back in his wheel, exercising
Frog King
Alright Lemmiwinks, we should probably get going now... The time is nigh, Lemmiwinks. Let us chase your destiny. [The Sparrow Prince flies in through the open window and lands on the upper edge of the gerbil cage] Ah! Sparrow Prince! What news do you bring?
Sparrow Prince
Wikileaks grows stronger with each passing moment. [jumps down into the cage] The birds are tweeting that he is about to release his biggest story yet.
Frog King
Then the moment is truly here! Come Lemmiwinks! Let us make haste! Le-le-Lemmiwinks? His heart is so heavy. I weep for him.
Sparrow Prince
Indeed. Could you do it, Frog Prince? Could you kill your own brother?
Frog King
I thank God I don't have to make that decision. [the two of them then just observe Lemmiwinks.] We might need to bring in some outside help.
Back in the music room, Stan is on the computer as the other eight kids look on
Stan
You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
Butters
Biggest story about who?
Craig
There's no telling. It could be about any of us. [Stan gets off the computer and notices something happening above him as a blinding light appears. The light softens to reveal the Catatafish]
Catatafish
Well met, children of Adam. I, am Catatafish.
Singers
Catatafish of the Salmon School.

Kyle
What?
Catatafish
I come asking for your help. There is only one thing that can stop Wikileaks. But right now Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner.
Stan
Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
Kyle
What is that thing?
Catatafish
I am Catatafish. I am a great wizard and, I am a friend. And I'm a ghost, besides of course being a fish.
Singers
Catatafish's tale will soon be told.

Stan
Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
Catatafish
He does it purely for reasons of evil. And his treachery is not limited to humans. Wikileaks posted exaggerated things about me, too. He posted on his Web site that I had sex with an underage fish, and that I made her perform bass to mouth. If you accept this quest you will help the Gerbil King defeat Wikileaks once and for all! But the choice is yours. I'm not here to make you do anything. Like that underage salmon. I didn't make her do anything. If she wants to do bass to mouth, how is it my fault?
Singers
Catatafish made a salmon suck asshole.</i></poem>
Catatafish
No! No, see, that's wrong! It's being exaggerated again!
Kyle
Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
Catatafish
Careful child! I assure you, Wikileaks is anything but stupid, except when he said I made that teenage fish perform ass to trout. That was stupid and untrue. Did I say ass to trout? I meant to say bass to mouth, though I guess it's basically the same thing, not that I did it.
The faculty restroom. Principal Victoria looks outside to make sure there's no one or nothing around, then closes the door and locks it. Mr. Mackey checks behind the mirrors for bugs while Mr. Adler checks the stalls
Principal Victoria
Alright, are we sure we're alone?
Mr. Mackey
We're alone, now what the hell are we gonna do?
Mr. Adler
What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!
Principal Victoria
This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!
Mr. Mackey
Oh right! "The School Faculty Tries To Poison All Their Students." That's not gonna be on Wikileaks!
Mr. Adler
Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them.
Mr. Mackey
All we were tryin' to do was keep another one of our students from killing themselves! We're not bad!
Principal Victoria
No, no, we're not bad.
Mr. Mackey
We're not bad. I mean, maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here. I mean, if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story.
Principal Victoria
What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?
Mr. Adler
Our students committing suicide?
Mr. Mackey
Hey that's right. Corey Duran killed himself last year and we're STILL dealing with the fallout. Maybe there is a way out of this. But we're gonna have to throw Eric Cartman under the bus.
Mr. Adler
How do we do that?
Mr. Mackey
We get a bus... and then we... throw Eric Cartman under it.
The boy's house, day. The gang of nine kids has arrived at Lemmiwinks' new home and Stan and Kyle are pounding on the front door.
Mother
[answering the door] Yes?
Stan
Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?
Mother
Yes, Vernon's around somewhere.
Stan
Come on, guys! [charges in with the other kids. Mrs. Trumski is about to close the door when Catatafish floats in]
Catatafish
Excuse me.
Vernon's room, moments later. The kids find Lemmiwinks in his cage
Butters
There he is! [the kids go to the cage] It's Lemmiwinks! [climbs the chair beside Lemminwink's cage]
Stan
Quick, we need something to carry him in!
Kyle
Here's a shoebox! [goes for the shoebox. Vernon walks in at that moment]
Vernon
Hey! What are you doing with my gerbil?!
Stan
We just need to borrow him, kid. [Kyle hands the box to Butters]
Vernon
MOOOM! SOME KIDS ARE STEALING MY GERBIL!
Stan
[walks up to Vernon] Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!
Vernon
MOOOM! [Frogn King and Sparrow Prince appear in the middle of the room, hovering, and Vernon and the others notice]
Frog King
There's no time, children! You must take Lemmiwinks now!
Kyle
Grab him! [Butters scoops Lemmiwinks into the shoe box and the group runs out the front door]
Vernon
[stops just outside the front door] MOOOM! [the group runs down the street]
Singers
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!

Frog King
Quickly! We must get to the school! [the group makes it to a bus stop just as a transit bus is pulling away]</i></poem>
Stan
Whoa whoa wait, wait! [the bus stops, the door opens, and the group gets on]
Inside the bus, the kids and the ghost animals take seats
Singers
Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!

Stan
Can't this thing go any faster?
Butters
Hang on, Lemmiwinks!
Singers
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!

Stan
Craig, are we still clear?
Craig
Nothing broke on the Web site yet.
Frog King
Faster driver! The final battle is about to begin! [the driver speeds up]
Singers
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!

From out of nowhere Mr. Adler and Mr. Mackey toss a bound and gagged Cartman onto the road and watch as the bus runs over him. Principal Victoria is with them. The bus rolls a bit further, but stops due to a broken muffler. The door opens and the group steps out
Kyle
What the hell happened?!
Mr. Mackey
Oh! Oh God! Oh God he killed himself! Eric Cartman killed himself! Did you see that? Oh why would he do it? [pulls out a letter] Oh wait uh here, here's a suicide note. Mkay. [opens it up and reads it:] Dear Guys, I just cannot go on mkay. I'm tired of being FAT, mkay, and I have to end it all. Mkay. -Eric Cartman.
Stan
Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
Mr. Mackey
[thinks a moment] Well why the hell didn't you say so! Come on, let's go!
Sparrow Prince
Go by car!
South Park, midtown. Principal Victoria has got everyone packed in her car and races down the street to get to the school
Singers
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!

Frog King
Quickly, while Lemmiwinks still has it in him!
South Park Elementary. Principal Victoria arrives at school and the group pours out of her car and rushes into the school
Singers
Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!

The music room, moments later. Wikileaks types furiously to get the scoop out: "SCHOOL FACULTY TRIES TO POISON STUDENTS!!" Stan leads the group into the music room
Stan
Stop right there, you little rat!
Singers
Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!

Frog King
[appears before Wikileaks and stops him] Wikileaks, you have chosen a path of evil and now you shall pay. Sparrow Prince, Catatafish! [Sparrow Prince and Catatafish descend on the shoebox and open it. Lemmiwinks peeks out, then leaves the box]
The battle begins. The two gerbils stand on their hind legs and face off. Wikileaks runs off and Lemmiwinks quickly follows. The camera tries to follow the action, but gets shaky. The gerbils dance around each other for a few seconds, then rush at each other and fight.
Frog King
Oh dude, he is fucking him up!
Butters
Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! [Indeed. Lemmiwinks had bit Wikileaks on the jugular and Wikileaks is bleeding. Wikileaks soon stops moving and Lemmiwinks gets off him]
Frog King
He did it!
Mr. Mackey
[walks over to the computer and gets to work] Okay, let's just delete all this tabloid garbage, mkay.
South Park Elementary hallway, some days later. Stan puts his stuff away in his locker and closes it. He walks over to Kyle, Kenny... and Cartman, who has casts on his right arm and right leg, and who's walking with a crutch
Stan
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
Kyle
Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
Cartman
Boy, I say.
Mr. Mackey
[rounds the corner and sees Cartman] Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.
Cartman
It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
Mr. Mackey
Well I think you're being very mature about this, Eric. It was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. I wanna thank you. Mkay.
Cartman
Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
Mr. Mackey
[walks through them and continues down the hallway] Well students, why don't we uh- [feels a pain in his stomach] Oooh. Oh, gee, uh...
Cartman
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, I j-I just uh I'll be right back. Oh! [lets out a wet fart] Aaaah! Oh it's bad! [so bad bits of shit shoot out his pants onto the floor] Excuse me kids, I need to run, I gotta WUUGH! [that last movement made him fly into the ceiling and back to the floor] OW!
Cartman
[softly] I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
Mr. Mackey
[stands up] Okay, can somebody get me some paper towels?? Or maybe a [poot. He hits the ceiling again and falls on his face] Ooowww, okay! [begins to slide down the hallway propelled by the poop and gas coming out his ass] Ooohhh, it's bad!
Frog King
Congratulations, Lemmiwinks.
Sparrow Prince
Thanks to you, private lives will stay private.
Catatafish
Yes, we are all free once again to make teenagers do bass to mouth.
Frog King
Just one question Lemmiwinks: How does it feel to have killed your own brother? [Lemmiwinks just gets up and walks away] Le-Lemmiwinks? [no answer] He's devastated.
Sparrow Prince
Yup, he's devastated.
End of Bass to Mouth

Broadway Bro Down
The USGS in Colorado. Four men are shown at their desks working. Nelson is front and center, Randy is behind him to his right, and two more men work behind them
Randy
I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
Nelson
I didn't see the game.
Randy
[soft sneeze] You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
Nelson
Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
Randy
A musical? [laughs and rises from his chair to approach him] Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! [laughs while moving around the desk]
Worker 1
[bearded] Good for you, Nelson. Did you get a blowjob afterwards?
Nelson
Sure did.
Worker 2
[clean-shaven] Niice. [Randy's smile turns into a frown]
Randy
What?
Worker 1
I took my girl to see that show last week. Got the best hummer of my entire life afterwards.
Nelson
Forty-five minutes non-stop.
Randy
[surprised, then] Nuh uh.
Worker 2
It's true. I'm taking my wife on Saturday bro.
Randy
[looks back at him for a few seconds] Noh uh.
Nelson
I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.
Randy
Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
Nelson
Wicked.
Randy
[interested] Oh. Wicked.
Denver, night. Wicked is playing
Singers

...Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe, she was just wicked people
Head to toe...
She wasn't good, to know what goodness is...

During the song, Sharon has her hands over her heart and she's thoroughly enchanted. Randy studies her reactions. Onstage several actors sing their hearts out. One actress descends from the rafters on a large circular ornament. Randy keeps studying Sharon
Randy
Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
Sharon
Nono, I'm good, thanks.
Randy
Okay, I'll be right back. [gets up and heads for the aisle, passing a couple on the way] 'Scuse me, sorry. [leaves the auditorium]
a bar in the theater. Randy walks up to it and takes a seat. Another man is already at the bar with the bartender
Randy
Can I get a scotch and soda? [the bartender goes off to prepare it]
Man 1
Enjoying the show?
Randy
[nervous at first] Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
Man 1
No?
Randy
To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
Man 1
Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is "blowjob."
Randy
Subliminal messages?
Man 1
It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it "subtext." Just listen really, really closely.
The auditorium. Randy returns to his seat
The Wizard
While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
Singers

Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me

A man and woman sing next, alternating lines
Witches
Now let's try ... defying ................... gravity ...

Male
....... Look at them ... becoming friends ... here in Oz, you love blowjobs.

Witches
And new loves cry ... defying ................... gravity ...

Male
....... Suddenly ... Don't you love free love blowjobs?

The drive home. Sharon's happily looking up beyond the car ceiling
Sharon
Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head. [swoons a bit, then looks at Randy, then at his crotch, then at him again] Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? [looks at his crotch again. Randy looks at her in surprise. She giggles and takes off her seatbelt, then leans over and begins to give him a blowjob]
Randy
[softly] Whoa, no way!
Park County Recreation Center, day. It has an aquatic center, and in there a bunch of kids stand in line for turns on the diving board. One fat kid is on the diving board wearing a life preserver. Waiting for the board are Stan, Cartman, Shelly, Kenny, and Clyde, amongst others. The fat kid is quite afraid and is crying
Stan
Come on, Larry! [Larry continues crying] Dude, why does this happen every time?
Shelly
Do something, you stupid vegan!
Cartman
Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
At the other end of the pool are Coach Randy and his coworkers, and Stephen Stotch
Randy
You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
Man 2
How long was it?
Randy
She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
Worker 2
Nice, bro!
Randy
Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.
Stephen
What was the show about?
Randy
Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.
The diving board. Larry is still crying up there. Shelly makes her move.
Stan
Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! [Shelly walks up the little ladder to the board and jumps up and down]
Shelly
Go! Go! [Larry bounces up and down crying, but doesn't fall into the water]
The other end of the pool
Randy
Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
Worker 2
Wicked isn't even the best, bro. You've gotta check out Jersey Boys! It makes women hummer crazy!
Randy
Really??
Worker 1
Nonono, have you see South Pacific? That's a jaw-breaker.
The Marsh house. Sharon is at the computer when Randy walks in
Randy
Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
Sharon
[gets off the chair] What?? Randy, are you serious??
Randy
[walks up to Sharon and hugs her] I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
Sharon
Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?
Stan
Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
Randy
Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
Shelly
Not the vegans!
Stan
No. Dad. Please don't do this!
The Feegan home, arguably the nicest house ever shown in South Park. The Feegans are indeed vegans, eating a dinner of mushrooms, alfalfa sprouts, vegan hot dogs, and tofu. They're also something of survivalists, as they all wear life preservers
Mr. Feegan
It takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in today's world! You get labeled "soft" or "silly." [he must have been talking for a while, for Stan and Shelly look bored] But the truth is there isn't a need to eat animal products. Would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan?
Shelly
Yes.
Mr. Feegan
Cancer, heart disease, drowning, all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket. And if people wanna say us vegans are silly, well they can just laugh all they want, 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular!
Shelly
Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. [Larry is stunned and drops his fork, then looks as his parents' reactions. His parents are stunned too, but grow angry]
Mr. Feegan
He does decide for himself! Larry's been a vegan since he was born! [Larry waves at her to keep going]
Shelly
Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. [Larry signals for her to keep 'em coming]
Mr. Feegan
You know that when you think you have the flu, you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs? Researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets.
Stan
[just outside the dining room on the phone with Randy while Mr. Feegan speaks.] Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out. [no answer] Please answer the phone Dad. [no answer. He looks around] Dad?
Times Square, New York, night. A huge Cup Of Soup sign looms over the square, which is filled with taxis and advertisements for everything. A taxi takes Randy and Sharon around town. An original song, "Man Time," plays. First the Marshes watch "Cats." A couple behind them doesn't waste any time - the woman gives her man a blowjob during the play. Randy notices and the man puts up his left thumb. Randy approves with his right thumb. The doors open and everyone exits "Sister Act." Sharon whispers in Randy's ear and Randy brightens up, responds, and the couple goes away happily.
Country Singer
Man time! I need some Man Time!
I got the horses fed and the truck locked up, been workin' my fingers to the bone.
Now I need a little bit of man time, gonna see me a Broadway show!

Next play is "Anything Goes"
Female Sailor

Male Sailor 1

Males
Day blowjob day!

Randy and Sharon are in a taxi again, and stop to see "The Jersey Boys." Then they're in a taxi and Sharon gives Randy a blowjob.
"Jersey Boys"
Country Singer
I'm about to get drunk and loud, gonna have me a rowdy good time.
All I need is my girl and my truck and some Rodgers and Hammerstein!

Next, they're holding hands at "The Phantom of the Opera"
Christine
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

Randy is falling asleep, to Sharon gives him another blowjob, and he's awake and happy.
Singers
Man time!

Hooters, evening. Over curly fries and beer, Randy is sharing his trip with the group of men who were present at the aquatic center
Randy
Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
Man 2
Sounds like a dream, bro.
Randy
It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is "Wicked" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
Worker 1
And Wicked moves to Seattle in a couple of weeks.
Nelson
It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
Stephen
Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.
Randy
Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
Bob
Huh?
Randy
[gets up and walks off a bit] Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
At a playhouse. Randy has begun rehearsals for his own musical. Onstage are the actors and a park bench
Lady 1

[dressed in cyan]
O what a glorious Sunday. I know what I'd like to do with my time.
[walks up to man nearby]
Would you like a blowjob?

Man 3
Yes I would like a blowjob [smiles]

Both
Nothing beats a blowjob on football Sunday.

Lady 1
[approaches a man on a bench] Excuse me, I'm the queen of blowjobs.

Man 4
Really?
I would love a blowjob.

All
A woman should give blowjobs on football Sunday

Lady 1

I want to be covered in semen on a bed in the Hotel Jerome
[the park bench is pulled away and the actors gather around her]
A woman is prettiest covered in semen.

All
Give you husband a blowjob when you get home.

Man 4
[to Lady 2, dressed in pink] And what about you, my fair lady? Could I trouble you for a quick Lewinsky?

Lady 2
Oh I don't know, kind sir. Blowjobs seem a little degrading to me.
Man 4
Come now, a blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart.
Men
Now get on your knees and put that heart to work!

All
Blowjobs, give up your blowjobs.

concurrent
Men
You're guilty at blowjobs, you love giving blowjobs

Women
... Blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs
together
Singers
So what could be better on a football Sunday? What could be better on a football Sunday?

The Marsh house, day. Larry walks up with a daisy and knocks. Shelly opens the door and they look at each other for a few more seconds
Shelly
What do you want, Larry? [Larry raises the daisy up slowly, presenting it to her]
Larry
Today, I went to 7-11 and I ate a Slim Jim. It was the greatest thing I ever tasted. Nobody ever stood up for me before. [sets the daisy on the landing, then turns around and trots off. Shelly looks on in wonder]
The playhouse, next day. More rehearsals. Man 4's stage name is now given
Lady 1
Oh Reginald! How about a hummer at halftime? A Super Bowl suckle from me?

Reginald
A Super bowl hummer at halftime from my lovely blowjob queen!

Both
Two people in love it's amazing. Tim Tebow please don't let us down. How about a hummer at halftime-?

Representative
Mr. Randy Marsh?
Randy
And hold! [the stage falls silent] Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there. [to the representative] Uhh, this better be important.
Representative
It is. I represent some of the biggest names in all of Broadway. They wish to speak with you.
Randy
Really? Oh my Gaw! [to the cast] Take a break, guys. this could be it!
Hooters, day. The messenger and Randy walk in and towards a table
Representative
Mr. Marsh, this is Andrew Lloyd Webber [eating a drumstick]
Webber
Helleow.
Representative
Stephen Schwartz
Schwartz
[gruffly] Hey bro.
Representative
Mr. Elton John. [Elton John belches] and Stephen Sondheim.
Sondheim
Sup bro?
Randy
Not much, sup with you guys?
Sondheim
No. I mean, "sup, bro!"
Webber
Sit down, Mr. Marsh, we need to have a talk. [Randy takes a seat]
Schwartz
We got wind of your musical. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Randy
Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
Elton John
You're making it too obvious! Women are gonna figure out what we're doin'!
Sondheim
Musicals are about subtext!
Randy
My musical has lots of subtext.
Sondheim
"A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work."
Randy
And then she does. It's a metaphor.
Schwartz
Bro! What's metaphorical about a musical called "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"?!
Webber
Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!
Randy
[rises] Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
Sondheim
You're gonna ruin everything, you idiot!
Randy
Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards! [rises, moving his chair aside] And now I need to get back to rehearsals. [leaves, then stops and turns around] Oh. And if "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. [turns around and walks out]
The Marsh house, day. Larry walks up and knocks. Shelly opens the door and they look at each other for a few seconds. Larry now has a tiny guitar
Shelly
What do you want, Larry? [he begins to play her a tune]
Larry
You make me come out of my shell, Shelly.
You give me strength where there was only fear
I ate at a Burger King today, Shelly
And stood up to a boy who called me "queer"
When you pushed me off the diving board I
...fell.
And you make the world a nicer place, Shelly
So I can come out of my... shell.
[sets the guitar on the landing, then slowly takes off his life preserver and sets it on the landing as well. He turns around and trots off again. He makes a right on the sidewalk and runs]

Shelly
Hey! [Larry stops and looks back] Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? [Larry turns around]
Back at the playhouse, Randy continues with rehearsals. The Queen carries a Broncos flag
Actors
Blow--- job--- Queen!
Don't stop giving that blowjob. Even when you're tired, don't stop! Don't stop!
Shaaaaroooon!</i>

Worker 2
[leads the group of Randy's friends] Randy! Randy, brah!
Randy
[to the cast] Uh, and hold. [the stage falls silent] Sorry folks, we're in a hold. [the actors are frozen in place] What is it now?
Worker 2
Stephen Sondheim is really pissed off, Randy. He says he wants to challenge you to a bro down.
Randy
[stunned at first, then gets angry] Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! [leaves the table and walks up the aisle towards the exit]
Worker 2
Randy, no! Stephen Sondheim is the greatest Broadway composer alive today! Perhaps the greatest of all time! You do NOT want to bro down with him.
Randy
[quietly] Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
Man 2
Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!
Randy
I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this! [turns] Let's bro down! [goes out the doors]
The Marsh house, Shelly's room. This is the first time we see it.
Larry
Oh no, you built another settlement?
Shelly
And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
Larry
[laughing merrily] Oh wow!
The living room below. Sharon and Mrs. Feegan enjoy some tea between them
Mrs. Feegan
They're having such a great time together. I really wanna thank you, Sharon.
Sharon
No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.
Mrs. Feegan
I have to admit it makes me a little nervous having Larry up there without a life preserver on, but I guess we have to take changes sometimes.
Sharon
That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.
Mrs. Feegan
That's right, I, I hear his musical is getting a lot of attention, that it really has a chance of making it.
Sharon
Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.
Hooters parking lot, at that very moment. A crowd of bros watch Randy and Sondheim face off, circling each other
Randy
Whassup brah?!
Sondheim
What brah?!
Randy
Sup brah?!
Sondheim
Take a swing, brah!
Randy
Right here, brah! [they continue circling each other]
Webber
Let's go, Sondheim! Wipe the street with his punk ass!
Randy
What makes you the brauthority brah?!
Sondheim
West Side Story, brah!
Randy
What brah?!
Sondheim
Sweeney Todd, brah!
Randy
What brah?! What brah?!
Sondheim
Merrily We Rode Along, bro! Why you gotta disrespect, bro?!
Randy
I do respect you, bro!
Sondheim
Show some respect, bro!
Randy
I do respect you, bro!
Sondheim
Then stop disrespectin', bro!
Randy
I respect you, bro!
Sondheim
Okay, I respect you too!
Randy
Okay! [the two men stay quiet begin to relax]
Schwartz
The bro down is over! Let's bro out!
Spectator
Bro out!
Spectator 2
Party people!
Hooters, later. Randy sits between Webber and Sondheim. The combatants now share some beer, clinking their mugs together
Randy
Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
Schwartz
That's what bros fuckin' do!
Sondheim
You're alright, Marsh. If it's cool with you, bro, Elton and Andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical.
Randy
Hey, really??
Elton John
Yeh. We can help youse out a li'l bit with the subtext. [checks out a waitress as she passes by - first her breasts, then her face]
Webber
How about instead of "Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen" we call it... "The Woman In White"
Randy
Oh, that is beautiful!
Bros
[all approve] Yeeeeeeeah!
Sondheim
And a cheer to Randy Marsh. Welcome... to Bro'dway.
Randy
Bro'dwaaay!
Sondheim
Wooooooooooo!
Webber
Woohoo!
The Marsh house, night. Randy walks into the living room
Randy
Ooof. [rubs the back of his head for a moment, then walks by the sofa, where Sharon is reading a book]
Sharon
Hey hun.
Randy
Hi babe. Sorry, I'm... [stops behind the sofa] kind of hanging out with the guys.
Sharon
Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
Randy
Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
Sharon
Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
Randy
Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
Sharon
Of course not, go ahead, hun.
Randy
[heads for the stairs] Alright babe.
Sharon
I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.
Randy
Okay. What's Shelly doing?
Sharon
I gave her those tickets to "Wicked." [Randy stops and looks back at Sharon] She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.
Randy
[does a double take, then plants his hands on the bannister] She's WHAT?!
Sharon
Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see "Wicked" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.
Randy
OH! [runs back outside] Shelly! Hold on! [closes the door. Sharon just watches him go and smiles]
On the road to Denver. Randy has gone back for Sharon and is driving madly down the road. He mows down a mailbox
Sharon
Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!
Randy
AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see "Wicked"?!
Sharon
Why does it matter?!
Randy
She's too young for that stuff!
Sharon
Too young?!
Randy
This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
Sharon
That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
Randy
I can't!
Sharon
WHY?!
Randy
Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
Sharon
[crosses her arms and looks away] That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
Randy
D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw "Wicked"?
Sharon
Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-
Randy
And after "Lion King" in New York? "Godspell"? "Mamma Mia"?
Sharon
Oh my gosh.
Randy
Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
Sharon
Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
Randy
No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
Sharon
It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw "Grease" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we- [gasps and puts her hands over her heart] Oh my God!
Randy
AAAA!
Sharon
AAAA!
Randy
Shelly! [steps on the gas pedal, and the car goes past 60 mph]
At the Denver Playhouse. Larry and Shelly are watching the play.
Singers

No one cares about wicked people.
Now she's gone but we don't care.
And are we gonna live in peace, and all live free, you'll see.
O Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe-

During the singing
Randy
[stopping by random rows] Shelly? Shelly? [he finds her and gets to her row] Shelly, come on. We have to go!
Shelly
Dad, what are you doing here?
Randy
Right now, Shelly! [A woman sitting by the aisle shushes him] Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
Elderly Man
Would you mind?! I'm trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter!
Randy
Oh you fucking pervert!
Usher
Alright, get the hell out of here, you! [he and another usher haul him away]
Randy
Shelly! [the two ushers take him outside and away from the playhouse, then push him away.]
Outside the playhouse. Randy stumbles and falls in front of Creepy City Costumes & Novelties. Sharon catches up with him
Sharon
Randy! [Randy gets up and smashes a window open with his left elbow, then reaches in. Sharon turns away so she doesn't get hit with shards of glass, then turns back] Randy, what are you doing?!
Randy
[bent over, putting on a costume] It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! [gets up dressed as Spider-Man, and puts on the mask last. He runs back into the playhouse]
Back inside the playhouse
The Wizard
While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
Singers
During the song, a shot of Larry and Shelly is shown. Onstage a witch moves towards on stage, only to be kicked away by Randy as he swings down from the rafters
Audience
Ohhhh.
Randy comes back around and kicks down another actor. He then swings up into the audience and almost kicks a man in the balcony
Audience Member
Hey, it's Spider-Man
on his way down, Randy kicks a few audience members out of their seats
Randy
Sorry! Sorry.
Randy knocks out three more cast members on stage, then goes up into the rafter. He strikes a water main and knocks out the valve, releasing the water onto the stage and audience
Randy
Agh! [swings onto one of the side balconies, knocking out a man. Randy gets his bearings on a rail and swings back towards the orchestra pit. He knocks out the conductor and finds himself dangling from a chandelier, the cable wrapped around his right ankle. The stage lights go out and the house lights come on]
Announcer
Sorry folks, we are in a hold. We are in a hold.
Audience
Awwwwww. [And that ends that showing]
The Marsh house, night. Shelly's in her bed, watching TV. Her bedroom door is ajar
Field Reporter
The musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater. [one of the actors is being led to an ambulance] The only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time. The fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver. [Shelly begins to sob softly]
Randy
[looks in, then opens the door some more and enters] Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. [backs out and closes the door]
The master bedroom. Sharon is already in bed and Randy slips in next to her
Randy
[glancing at Sharon from time to time] It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy! [looks at Sharon] I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you. [lies down] I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.
Sharon
I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
Randy
Really?
Sharon
[sits up] Oh Randy, [kneels before him. Randy sits up] the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.
Randy
[rises and kneels before her] Oh Sharon, you're the best. [they laugh and hug each other]
Sharon
So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
Randy
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
Announcer
"The Book of Mormon." You'll get a blowjob.
End of Broadway Bro Down

South Park Elementary, day. The school has been assembled in the auditorium. Principal Victoria, Mr. Adler, and Mr. Mackey are on stage with a representative from SPUSD, or something. The image the rep stands in front of is the presidential seal, with the words "PRESIDENT'S COUNCIL ON FITNESS, SPORTS & NUTRITION" written on it
Board Rep
Last week the students of this school participated in the Presidential Fitness Test. I'm sad to announce that South Park Elementary scored the lowest in health and fitness in the entire country. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] On the whole, you students actually scored fine. But the President's Fitness Test is scored on a school-wide average, and one fourth grader at this school scored so low, with a terrifying body fat score, [Cartman knows the man is talking about him], and high blood pressure and the cholesterol levels of a seventy-year-old man, that it actually brought you entire school's average down to the lowest in the country. [Cartman yawns] However, the Presidential Fitness Program never wants to single out one child, because then that child might feel bad. And so as far as we're concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs.
Principal Victoria
Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?
Board Rep
Sorry. As far as the board is concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs. And so it is the recommendation of this board that every week, each class will alternate turns, giving up their recesses and instead reporting to PE.
Assembly
AWWW!
The school gym, day. Mr. Garrison's class is in PE
Coach
Alright, fourth grade class, you're up first. We're gonna do some rope-climbin'.
Stan
God this sucks!
Kyle
Four weeks we gotta do this?
Cartman
Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. [Stan, Kyle, and some other kids are not amused]
Coach
Alright McCormick, let's start with you. Climb the rope. [Kenny approaches the rope, jumps up, and starts climbing]
Cartman
Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. [Kenny climbs down and Kyle approaches]
Coach
Alright, let's go Broflovski. [Kyle jumps on and starts climbing]
Cartman
Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
Stan
Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
Cartman
Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
Stan
Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
Craig
Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.
Cartman
Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
Wendy
We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
Cartman
Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
Clyde
Oh grow up.
Cartman
Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
Stan
That's what we mean by "grow up" dude! Stop being a baby!
Craig
Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! [Cartman gasps]
Cartman's room, afternoon. Cartman is crying to his stuffed animals again. Or at least to his plushies
Cartman
Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
Clyde Frog
But Eric, you are cool.
Cartman
I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
Peter Panda
It's not your fault, Eric. How can they blame you for what is clearly President Obama's fault?
Cartman
What do you mean, Peter Panda?
Peter Panda
You didn't make that stupid Presidential Fitness Test. Obama did.
Polly Prissypants
Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl.
Cartman
Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
South Park Elementary, day. Lunchtime has arrived and all the kids are in the cafeteria.
Butters
Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
Stan
Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
Butters
Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? [the doors burst open and Cartman steps in and looks around. No one says a word]
Cartman
What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! [slams a door, but it doesn't close. Cartman walks out]
Butters
Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
Jimmy
Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit.
Fifth Grader
Yeah. The fifth graders agree. We're all being punished for one lazy bitch. Let's make him suffer.
Jimmy
All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition, Colorado Division Reigional Office, day. Jimmy and Butters are seated at a desk facing the board rep, who's also seated
Jimmy
Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary.
Board Rep
Aahh yes, the Fatty Boombalatty class. How's the extra PE treating you?
Butters
Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
Board Rep
What do you want me to do about it?
Jimmy
Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate.
Board Rep
[rises from his chair and approaches a chart] 'Fraid that's impossible. The National Fitness Test has very specific standards. No one child can ever be made to feel singled out. We don't even like to use the term "physically fit" anymore because it can make a student feel unphysically fit, and then that student might end up feeling like a total retard.
Jimmy
...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?
Board Rep
A-and then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard.
Butters
Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
Jimmy
All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
Cartman's bedroom, day. He walks into his room, which is quite trashed. He looks around in horror, then goes back downstairs, where he spots his mom paying some bills at the table
Cartman
Mom, have you been here all day?!
Liane
No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?
Cartman
Somebody's been in my room! [she looks up at him as he goes back to his room. He looks under his things to see if anything is missing. His mom appears at the door] Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
Liane
Are you sure, sweetie?
Cartman
Am I sure?? Look at this place!
Liane
But who would want to s-
Cartman
[turns around and glares at her] Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me! [goes back to searching his stuff and finds a watch] They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch... [finds a video game] My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have- [looks at a corner of his room. A chair set apart for Clyde Frog is empty, but his other four dolls are arranged and seated in from of it.] Oh my God. [panicking] Clyde Frog!
Liane
What?
Cartman
No. [goes to the corner and tosses his dolls aside, then looks up in despair] NOOO! [runs to his closet and looks in there. He doesn't find Clyde Frog in there] CLYDE FROG!! [stops to tell him mom] They took Clyde Frog! [runs out of his room. Liane is confused]
Cartman's house, outside in the back yard. Cartman runs out and looks around
Cartman
[calling out and walking around] Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?! [stops and notices something on a tree. It is Clyde Frog, nailed to a tree through his front paws and forehead. It's ripped all over and cotton pops out of the rips. Under the frog is the word "VENGEANCE" scratched onto the tree bark in red spray paint] Clyde. CLYDE FROG! [throws up]
Cartman's house, outside in the back yard. Cartman is holding a lavish funeral for Clyde Frog
Cartman
I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers. [Stan and Kyle are falling asleep. Kyle rests his head on his left hand] And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, "I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
Kyle
Shut the hell up, Cartman!
Cartman
Got something to say Kyle?! [grips the sides of the podium]
Kyle
How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
Cartman
How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle! [stops himself] Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. [a bagpipe player begins a tune. Two men lower the casket into the ground]
Cartman
Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
Craig
Where's our five dollars?
Cartman
Fly bu-what?
Craig
It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
Stan
Yeah.
Cartman
[thinks a moment] Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
Class
AWWW! [all the kids get up and leave]
Kid 1
Come on!
Kid 2
Screw this.
Kid 4
Hurry up, screw this.
Cartman
Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition, Colorado Division Reigional Office, day. The board rep looks over some reports while leaning against his desk. A receptionist walks up to him
Receptionist
Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?
Board Rep
Oh yes, the Boom Boom Chubby Choom Choom school.
Receptionist
They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them.
Board Rep
[runs to the front door followed by the receptionist] Oh my Jesus! Oh, not a 99% rally.
Outside, on a small strip of grass in a parking lot. Butters and Jimmy hold up some protest signs
Butters
I sure hope this works.
Field Reporter 1
[out of nowhere] Tom, I'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy Red Robin. Occupy Red Robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically I am part of the 99% so, what do I have to say about all this? [no comment from either of the boys]
Cartman's house, dining room. The lights are low. Cartman and his plushies are seated around the table, and Cartman serves himself some tea.
Cartman
Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
Peter Panda
Why would somebody do such a terrible thing?
Polly Prissypants
Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl.
Cartman
I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
Rumpertumskin
Let's stop the charades, Eric, and let's get down to business.
Cartman
What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
Rumpertumskin
We all know who fuckin' killed Clyde Frog, and she's the same dirty slut who's been fucking with us our whole lives!
Liane
Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?
Polly Prissypants
Does everything look okay?
Peter Panda
Sit down, you fucking bitch.
Cartman
Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
Liane
[takes a seat at the other end of the table] Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-
Polly Prissypants
Shut your fat piehole, bitch!
Rumpertumskin
Yeah! You know what you did, skank! You let Clyde Frog get murdered!
Liane
No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear.
Muscleman Marc
Then why did you write in your diary "It was probably time for Eric to grow out of his stuffed animals" anyway?!
Cartman
That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
Muscleman Marc
Well, all I'm saying, Eric, is that-
Liane
Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-
Muscleman Marc
ALL I'M SAYING, ERIC, is that you went through your mom's diary for a reason!
Liane
Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.
Cartman
So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
Occupy Red Robin, day. Butters and Jimmy are now joined by a bongo drummer and a dancing man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask. They are surrounded by South Park's emergency services and the media, and one Java Jim's truck.
Sgt. Yates
[on the phone calling for backup] You'd better give me every cop you've got on the South Side! I don't care where ABC parks their truck, as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks! [hangs up and walks to the command center nearby] Jesus, this protest is getting out of hand! Alright, what exactly are we dealing with?
Officer 1
It's no good. The protest has quadrupled in size since this morning. As you can see from this aerial photograph, the protest covers almost two square miles. We have right officers here, here, and here. The media has been contained in this area. [next to Red Robin]
Sgt. Yates
And where are the actual protesters?
Officer 1
Oh, these two people right here. [circles the spot on which Butters and Jimmy stand]
Sgt. Yates
How are we gonna contain this ting?!
Officer 2
I'm afraid it's about to get worse. You see this area here? This is where we're setting up the stage for Bon Jovi.
Sgt. Yates
Bon Jovi?
Officer 2
These are good cops! We can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment! The problem is, with this area blocked by napping tents, we have no place to serve the officers beer.
Sgt. Yates
Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards? [steps forward] Full-on class warfare.
Cartman's room, night. He's sound asleep, snoring even, when his room begins to glow. Flames appear. Cartman begins to wake up from the heat and sits up. He sees the flames
Cartman
What the hell?! [the flames set his curtains on fire. He sees them next to his bed and stands up on the bed] Mom? Mom, my room is... [turns around and sees Peter Panda and his dresser on fire] AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
Cartman's house, after the fire. Police and fire have come to his rescue, and a fireman comes down the ladder with the charred remains of Peter Panda
Fireman 1
The fire started with this. Definitely a case of arson. Somebody hates this kid.
Cartman
[runs up] Don't you touch him! Leave him alone! [swats the doll out of the fireman's hands] Peter Panda!
Peter Panda
Eh, Eric.
Cartman
Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
Peter Panda
Eric... Remember... [sobbing] Stay... keeewl. [Eric begins bawling. The fireman picks the doll back up]
Fireman 2
Sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence.
Cartman
[on all fours] Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
Red Robin, inside. A female field reporter comments
Female Reporter
The 99%ers movement continues to grow as more and more Americans occupy Red Robin. I asked some of the people exactly what they hoped to accomplish. [earlier] And sir, what do you hope to accomplish by this movement?
Patron
I like the uh, A1 Peppercorn Burger. And they got ummm, bo-bottomless fries.
Female Reporter
And as the protesters inside Red Robin unite together, word is that filmmaker Michael Moore has joined the protesters outside.
Outside
Michael Moore
[through his bull horn] I look at the faces of you protesters and I see the future of America! We are the 99%! YESSS!!
A house in the neighborhood. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach the front door. Their bikes are scattered all over the lawn. Kyle knocks on the door and a fifth grader answers it
Kyle
Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
Fifth Grader
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. You got any proof?
Stan
Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
Fifth Grader
That doesn't prove anything. That fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him.
Kyle
Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
Fifth Grader
He's in your class but you don't deal with him! So we are gonna remedy the situation! We've got big plans! Just stay out of our way and let the men handle this! [closes the door. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny turn around to leave.]
The Black residence, night. Liane and Cartman are staying there while their own house is repaired. Liane is at table with Token's parents] drinking coffe
Liane
Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
Bob
Of course. You can't be staying in a home with that much fire damage.
Linda
To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.
Liane
I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.
Token's room. Token has a sports-car bed. Cartman is being paranoid
Cartman
This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
Token
Why are you involving me in this?
Cartman
Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
Occupy Red Robin, next day. Butters is gone for the moment, so only Jimmy stands there with his protest sign. Everyone else is still where they were
Field Reporter 2
Breaking news from the Occupy Red Robin movement. The protesters have decreased in number from two to one, as one of the protesters has apparently splintered off from the group to start a new movement: Occupy the Restroom.
The restroom area. The first reporter is close to the mens' room
Field Reporter 1
Tom, Occupy the Restroom has been going on for almost thirty minutes now. Certainly a sign that this country is more divided than ever. These 99%ers are fed up, [backs up to the restroom door] and as a result you can clearly see this restroom is "OCCUPIED." [points to a little window that now reads "OCCUPIED." A second later, a toilet is flushed inside. The door opens and Butters exits zipping his pants up.] Uh, Tom, it looks like the movement is finished, but from the time it took, it must have been a pretty decent-sized movement.
Occupy Red Robin. Butters returns and takes up his sign
The Black residence, night. Cartman has made himself at home in Token's room with his dolls, chips, and Token's remote control. Token is not pleased and has crossed his arms
Token
[getting irritated] Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
Cartman
What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
Token
This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
Cartman
Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
Token
You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
Cartman
Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me. [the alarm sounds. Cartman puts his chips aside and gathers his toys close] What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
Token
That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
Cartman
What?! Who?!
Token
I don't know.
Cartman
I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! [Token looks out his window, Cartman leaves the bedroom]
The Black residence, back yard, night. Cartman runs outside with the bat
Cartman
Who's there?! [notices Token coming out behind him] Lock that door behind you, Token. [then shouts at whomever might be there] Black people live here! [some flood lights come on]
Token
A motion detector. [Kyle's shadow runs by and Cartman notices it. He gives chase and tackles Kyle]
Cartman
Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
Kyle
It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
Cartman
Oh sure!
Stan
[walking out from behind a garage] Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
Cartman
Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader? [looks around] Oh shit! [drops the bat and runs back inside] I told you to lock that door, Token! [runs up to Token's room and searches for his stuffed toys] No. [sees the other four boys come in] Nononono! [grabs Kenny by the throat and shakes him] Where are they Kenny??!!
Kenny
[slaps Cartman's hand off] (I don't really know!)
Cartman
HAAAAGH! [runs out and closes the door, then locks it and runs off]
Stan
Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Cartman
[returns] I don't trust any of you assholes! [to his dolls] Where are you sons of bitches?! [leaves]
The fifth grader's house. Three fifth graders stand on the front lawn
Stephen Tamil
Alright guys. You ready?
Classmates
Ready!
Stephen Tamil
Here we GO! [he and one of his friends raise their signs, and the three of them march forth]
Occupy Red Robin, night. The fifth graders walk up to Butters and Jimmy and stand alongside them
Butters
Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?
Stephen Tamil
We are the 83%! We are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class! The fourth grade is stickin' it to the other 83% of the school!
Jimmy
Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.
Butters
Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
Stephen Tamil
Because your class had Cartman in it, and he's the 1%!
Jimmy
But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.
Channel 8 News
Field Reporter 3
This is it. The inevitable has happened at Occupy Red Robin. It is full-on class warfare.
Female Reporter 2
And now class warfare is breaking out. Apparently it is the fourth grade class versus the fifth grade class.
The command center nearby. Yates and the other men are roused by the commotion
Sgt. Yates
It's here! The class warfare is finally here!
Officer 2
Yeeah!
The Black residence, night. Cartman walks into the darkened kitchen
Cartman
Hello?? [lightning crackles outside and floods the kitchen in light for a moment] Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! [sees a boiling crock pot, walks up to it and removes the lid. Inside he see the third...]
Cartman
Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! [more lightning crackles as he runs out of the kitchen.]
The Black living room. Cartman walks into it, still looking for the two remaining dolls
Cartman
Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin! [walks towards the fireplace] Jesus Christ! [over the fireplace he sees Rumpertumskin drawn up by four chains and a bomb wrapped around his neck]
Rumpertumskin
Eric! Don't come any closer!
Cartman
Who did this to you?!
Rumpertumskin
You said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.
Cartman
Don't worry, I'll get you down!
Rumpertumskin
No Eric, don't come any- [Cartman trips a wire that sets off the bomb, decapitating Rumpertumskin]
Cartman
AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER [begins to cry] Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
Polly Prissypants
It's okay, Eric. It's over now. [you can see Cartman actually doing her voice. He expresses shock, then turns around. Polly Prissypants is seated on an armchair with a loaded gun resting against her]
Cartman
Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
Polly Prissypants
Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up.
Cartman
...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! [Token, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny look down from the second floor]
Polly Prissypants
Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together.
Cartman
They were your FRIENDS!
Polly Prissypants
They were holding us back! All the kids making fun of you at school, saying you're not keewl! Your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of, don't you see?!
At the front door. The Blacks and Liane have returned, but Mr. Black can't open the door
Bob
Dead-bolted. Token! [knocks twice, then heads for the window] Token, you in there?! [the three adults look in]
Back in the living room...
Cartman
Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
Polly Prissypants
No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Token did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after.
Cartman
There's one problem. [walks up to the doll, takes the gun and walks back to where he was] You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
Polly Prissypants
Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!
Cartman
Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
Polly Prissypants
It's the only way Eric. You have to do it. Please! I can't live with myself after what I've done. Please, you have to do it Eric.
Cartman
[sobs for almost a minute, then aims the gun] Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
Polly Prissypants
Say "hello" to the sunrise for me. [Cartman cries and looks away as he starts firing at her. First shot is straight through the forehead. He fires twice more as the four boys watch from the second floor, and three more as the Blacks and Ms. Cartman watch from outside. Polly Prissypants has four shots through the head and two more that took out chunks of her cheeks. Cartman cries, having lost the last of his stuffed dolls]
Stan
Dude, what the hell?
Kyle
We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
Outside...
Liane
[apologetic] My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. [laughs weakly]
The Red Robin parking lot, day. A worker sweeps up all the debris from the Occupy Red Robin movement
Field Reporter 3
Occupy Red Robin is over. Class warfare has torn apart the 99% and replaced it with the 30%, the 26%, and even little brackets of 5%s here and there. What does this mean for our country? What oes this mean... for me?
Officer 2
Hey! Get down to State Street! They're occupying Macaroni Grill!
Field Reporter 3
Oh hell yeah! I'll occupy me some goat-cheese peppadew peppers! [runs off]
End of 1%

A History Channel Thanksgiving
South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's class. The bell rings. Mr. Garrison goes to the front of the class. On the chalkboard is written "Thanksgiving"
Mr. Garrison
Okay children, let's all take our seats. [most of them are seated; Kyle, Token, Bebe and Stan are the last four to get seated] As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.
Butters
Oh neato, huh fellas?
Guest
[a stout "Native American"] Hello boys and girls. My name is David Running Horse... Sawitsky, and I am one sixteenth Cherokee Indian.
Cartman
Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? [Sawitsky crosses his arms and is not all all pleased]
Sawitsky
There've been a lot of "stories" about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?
Butters
[innocently] Thanksgiving is about murder?
Kyle's room, afternoon. The four boys are there. Stan and Kyle are reading books at Kyle's desk, Kenny is reading a couple of books on the floor, and Cartman is... on his back on Kyle's bed eating Cheesy Poofs
Cartman
This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
Kyle
Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
Cartman
Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
Kyle
[looks over his shoulder angrily] Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
Cartman
Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
Stan
We all have to do this report together, dude.
Cartman
You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
Kyle
How is that gonna help?!
Cartman
[like a doorbell] Dumbass, it's November. [normally] The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
A TV. The History Channel logo comes up.
Announcer
You're watching The History Channel, where the truth is history.
Narrator
[as re-enactments play in color and in black and white] A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?
Cartman's house, day. The boys are on Cartman's couch watching TV
Cartman
Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
Narrator
[more re-enactments] We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens! [dramatic flashes of darkness as the alien is shown up close, then a picture of a fetus, and then...]
Duncan Everton
[Professor of History, Oakmont H.S.] In every journal entry we researched from those early Pilgrims, not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there.
Narrator
And what about the food? [a juicy baked turkey is shown, then the previous image is shown without the alien] Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology? [the alien reappears in the scene, but with two other aliens]
Cartman
Uh-huh??
Kyle
What? This isn't history.
Stan
Dude, it is called History Channel.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Charles Biggens
[Culinary Associates of America] And if we look in all the journals and aall the history books, there is no reference to stuffing before 1621. So where did it come from? Did it come from space? We just don't know.
Narrator
Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form? [an alien with an erect penis is drawn over the aerial image] What exactly did the Pilgrims experience? [colored lights move around over the ocean's horizon as Pilgrims gather by the beach] How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November? [a tiny UFO hovers near a turkey]
Kyle
What??
Cartman
Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
Kyle
We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
Cartman
Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? [he and Kenny raise their hands, then Stan raises his]
Kyle
[at Stan] Dude!
Cartman
Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? [raises Kyle's hand]
Kyle
[sighs] Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
A mansion, night. A phone rings. The time on the alarm click is 2:14 a.m., and the couple in bed wake up. The man takes the phone
THC President
[sits up in bed] Yes? A report from where? [sits up on the side of the bed] Does Congress know about this yet? Try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready. I'll be there as soon as I can. [hangs up and sits back down]
Wife
Darling?
THC President
They found something. This could be it. [makes a fist]
The bus stop, day. The school bus stops and the boys get off
Cartman
Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
Stan
...What?
Cartman
Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
Kyle
Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!
Cartman
See what I mean, you guys? [a black car with tinted windows pulls up at a corner within sight of the boys and the passenger window comes down and the agents inside look at the boys]
Agent 1
[brunet] Is that them?
Agent 2
[blond] That's them.
An interrogation room, somewhere. The boys are seated and waiting for someone. Three men walk in - the two agents and the man from the mansion. The agents close the door and the man from the mansion goes to the table and takes his seat opposite the boys. He leafs through the boys' report, and the boys look at each other
THC President
You boys have been very busy... [he closes the report] We need to know everything that you know.
Stan
'bout what?
THC President
Have you been contacted by alien life forms?
Agent 1
Did you come across some kind of ship or something?
Kyle
Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
THC President
[silence for a few seconds, then] We are The History Channel. [rises from his chair] For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence.
Kyle
We saw it on your channel.
THC President
What exactly did you seez?!
Stan
That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
THC President
My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?
Butters' house, living room. He's watching a Jonas Brothers video
Steven
Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel.
Butters
Okay Dad.
Announcer
You're watching the History Channel, the only network dedicated to history. Coming up next, it's Monster Quest! Larrh! Followed by Hairy Bikers. Errh! But now, back to Part 3 of Ancient Aliens at Thanksgiving.
Narrator
It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings.
Stan Marsh
[history expert] Stuffing wasn't mentioned anywhere until 1621? And it might have been... alien technology?
Narrator
And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?
Kyle Broflovski
[Ph. D., Professor of Thanksgiving - DeVry Institute] Of course you can't prove there were no aliens at the first Thanksgiving! Just like you can't "prove" that... the Pilgrims themselves weren't alien! Can you prove that?! Here: draw that Thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand! Maybe that symbol matches... galaxies in space or something! OooOoOoOooOOO! [moves his hands around]
Narrator
[a scene of alien families sharing Thanksgiving on Earth] Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say "yes."
Kyle
You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
Kyle's house, living room. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are on the sofa watching the same special Butters is
Stan
Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. [smiles]
Kyle
How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. [a knock is heard at the front door and Kyle goes to answer it]
Sawitsky
What are you doing?!
Kyle
...Uh oh.
Sawitsky
The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!
Kyle
I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
Sawitsky
Haven't my people been through enough?! [whips out a gun with his left hand and quickly aims at at Kyle] Goddamn you!
Kyle
Ack dude! [backs up as Sawitzky walks towards him]
Sawitsky
The white man is gonna PAY for his lies! [stops in front of Stan and Kenny, keeping his gun aimed at Kyle]
In the sky, black Army helicopters approach. In one of them, the History Channel and two agents sit
Agent 2
Look at this, sir! [hands him a picture] An aerial photograph of Cape Cod where the Pilgrims landed in 1620. [puts his right hand on it and traces a turkey on the photo with it] Five Pilgrim settlements, with Plymouth Rock here. [puts a dot on the location] The same symbols appear everywhere in history. [on a baked turkey, in the night sky...]
Agent 1
The symbology lines up to mirrored points in space. If Kyle Broflovski is right, then Plymouth Rock is some kind of wormhole.
THC President
Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!
Agent 3
Sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things.
Agent 2
True dat.
THC President
True dat.
Plymouth, Massachusetts. day. The monument to Plymouth Rock is shown. The helicopters show up and descend onto the park near the monument. Plymouth Rock itself is shown in the water, unprotected.
THC President
Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!
Agent 4
[through his bullhorn] Alight people, let's clear out! We need you ALL to disperse! [a woman and her daughter stop to listen] This area is under quarantine. [the woman and daughter leave]
THC President
Give me a piece of chalk. [agent 1 hands it to him. The president quickly traces a turkey on the rock, then backs up.] Huh... Nothing.
Agent 5
Guess Kyle Broflovski was wrong.
THC President
Well, at least we weren't outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid. [they all turn and walk out of the water] We should've known. Pilgrims couldn't be from space.
Space, the final frontier. A Pilgrim shoots through space in a wormhole and hits the planet hard. Electricity crackles through some power lines. A shadow climbs out of the impact crater. It's... a Pilgrim. Nearby, a truck rolls by, driven by Natalie Portman. The Pilgrim runs from the crater and into Portman's path; she rolls over him, then stops.
The History Channel learns of this and sends its top men out to investigate. Several tents go up at the crash site
Agent 6
Here. You can see it right there. An object clearly fell from the sky and struck the Earth.
THC President
What is it?
Agent 6
It's a Pilgrim, sir. [the president is stunned, looks outside, then walks outside with five other men]
THC President
So then, Professor Broflovski was right after all. [the camera pans up into the sky. Another camera travels through space]
Narrator
Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets. [the camera approaches a rock formation that has golden (literally) ears of corn sticking out of it. The camera then goes around the formation and through a thick cloud layer] These alien beings visited our world, and once, even settled it, from deep within the galaxy Canis Major, and a distant planet called... Plymouth. [the camera pops up and sees a magnificent building from which rise four massive golden ears of corn. An entrance with 14 colossal Pilgrim statues is shown. Inside the cathedral-like building a Pilgrim king, seated on a throne flanked by two huge golden cornucopias overflowing with gold and jewels, speaks to a huge crowd]
Pilgrim King
Fellow Pilgrims! The great Captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines! We must prepare for war with the Indians!
Another planet, named Indi. The Indian chief there speaks to his people
Indian Chief
Now it is OUR time! We shall attack Plymouth, and we will take... ALL THEIR STUFFING! [the Indians cheer]
Cartman's house, day. Liane is at the kitchen cutting up construction paper. Cartman runs through the dining room, then returns and enters the kitchen
Cartman
Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
Liane
What hon?
Cartman
Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
Liane
Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.
Cartman
Oh no. Oh NO!
Liane
What is it, hon?
Cartman
Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! [turns around and leaves the kitchen]
The supermarket, day. A woman is taking her groceries to her car. Cartman runs into the the chapping cart and knocks it over, spilling the woman's groceries. Cartman then turns and runs into the store. Liane folows him in. Cartman finds a worker
Cartman
You guys have stuffing?!
Attendant 1
Stuffing? Sure. Aisle 17.
Cartman
Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come! [Liane takes a shopping cart and follows Cartman to the right aisle. Cartman looks for the stuffing, but doesn't fine any. The attendant walks by] Hey! Where is it!
Attendant 1
It's right there, right on the uh... [sees that the stuffing shelf is empty] wait, that can't be right. Hey, hey Chet. What happened to all the stuffing?
Chet
[walks up] What are you talking about? [sees that there is no stuffing, and his jaw drops a bit]
Attendant 1
We got more in the back, right?
Chet
I just did inventory in the back, it... it was all put out here!
Attendant 1
You mean it's two weeks until Thanksgiving and we're completely out of stuffing?!
Chet
Oh no!
Cartman
No!
Chet
No!
Cartman
NO!
Planet Plymouth, day. An Indian delegation and a Pilgrim delegation meet up
Pilgrim King
You dare come to Plymouth, ambassador?! After attacking our stuffing mines?!
Indian Chief
The stuffing mines were never yours!
Pilgrim King
Wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals, ambassador! This will be war!
Indian Chief
You are in no position to declare war! Your lead commander is nowhere to be found!
Pilgrim King
And how knoweth you that?!
Indian Chief
Word travels fast in our sector.
Pilgrim King
I do not give free bowls of stuffing, what sayest you?! We will take back control of the stuffing mines! [turns and leaves with his men]
Indian Chief
Then the Thanksgiving treaty will be off! [turns and leaves with his men]
Pilgrim King
And I pray to stuffing that you are wrong. [looks up to the sky as his men move on without him] Where are you, Miles Standish?
Kyle's living room, later. Sawitzky is still lecturing the boys on Native American history
Sawitzky
And furthermore, everything Kyle Broflovski said about Native Americans being from outer space was untrue! Native Americans were brutalized, and David Sawitzky's ancestors deserve an apology! It was wrong to mix aliens and real history!
Stan
I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
Kyle
[through gritted teeth] Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
Stan
I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
Kenny
(Yeah, that's true.)
Kyle
Would you guys stop!
Sawitsky
Just keep writing your apology! [paces. The front door opens and Miles Standish jumps in dramatically]
Miles
How now, Indian?! Why hast thy race sent me here to Earth?!
Sawitsky
[surprised] Huh? [Miles runs at him and throws him up against a wall] Ack.
Stan
Dude!
Miles
You Indians took me to thy planet, and then cast me here! Why?! [punches Sawitzky twice. Sawitzky falls to the floor and Miles begins kicking him in the balls]
Kenny
(Go, dude!)
Stan
Yeah, go on dude!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Miles
[turns Sawitzky over and picks him up] Hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die?! Tell me, Indian!
Sawitzky
I I uh I'm only one sixteenth.
Miles
Hold your lying tongue! [puts a glowing ball into Sawitzky's mouth] This shall prove if thou art Indian or not! [Sawitzky begins to tremble and moan, then he's surrounded by a purple light and consumed] Ah, he was not.
Stan
I didn't think so.
Miles
[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] I have been told of your expertise, Kyle of DeVry Institute. I need your wisdom to get back to my planet.
Kyle's house, outside. Miles, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny go to a waiting truck
Miles
Into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me! [the boys get in] We must make haste to Cape Cod! [then he does]
Stan
[looking at the driver] Who's this?
Miles
This is Natalie.
Natalie
Hi guys.
Cape Cod, night. THC continues camping out there.
Agent 7
Alright, sir. We got some more information on the Pilgrim who crashed to Earth. Thirty seconds after impact the Pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat.
THC President
Who did the truck belong to?
Agent 6
We believe it belonged to Natalie Portman, sir.
THC President
The actress? That doesn't make sense.
Agent 8
It gets worse. All over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing. We don't think it's coincidence.
THC President
You're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage, this "Pilgrim" dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by Natalie Portman?!
Agent 9
Look, if anyone knows about stuffing, it's Natalie Portman!
THC President
[walking forward, filling the screen] We have to find Professor Broflovski. He was right about all of this. He'll know what to do.
A campsite for the night. Kyle sits alone by the campfire, and the trailer-truck is behind him. Inside the trailer, Miles talks to the others
Miles
We shall make camp here for the night. On the morrow perhaps we can reach Cape Cod. And Thanksgiving may yet be saved. [looks outside and sees Kyle] What is wrong with Kyle of DeVry Institute?
Stan
Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
Miles
[studying Kyle some more] He seems almost like a Puritan lady whose period hath stopped. [moments later, he goes outside to talk to Kyle] I fear, Kyle, that you still do not know whose side to be on.
Kyle
No, ah I don't.
Miles
It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world.
Kyle
I actually only just said that sarcastically.
Miles
HA! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! [pats him on the left shoulder a few times] Then you are only just a remarkably gifted child! [puts his right hand over Kyle's left hand, then withdraws it to pull out a map] Here, let me show you. Your planet is one of the five. [points to the others] Plymouth, Indi, Colthenheim, and this planet over here nobody really cares about. [spreads his right hand over the map so each fingertip touches a planet, then traces the hand with a pencil] The five are connected by a series of wormholes. [the trace is finished] My people came to your world, and so did our enemies. But we made a treaty, and for 300 years our people have not fought. But now, the treaty is over.
Kyle
But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
Miles
You can't believe what everyone tells you, Kyle. You have to open your eyes. [stands up and puts down his map on his seat. Natalie, Stan, and Kenny look on from the trailer] Soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to Plymouth, and the stuffing mines can again be ours, for he who controls the stuffing, controls the universe. [all of a sudden, a night sun focuses on him and a helicopter is heard]
A pilot
Hold it right there! [five black cars pull up quickly and surround Miles and Kyle. Natalie, Stan and Kyle leave the trailer]
Agent 10
We found Professor Broflovski! He is with the Pilgrim! [the agents close in on Miles and he unsheathes his sword]
Miles
Stay back, all of you! For I will get to Cape Cod and cannot be stopped! Come boys! Let us fight to the death!
THC President
[rushes into the middle] Wait! Stop, stop! Please, Mr. Standish, we are all on the same side here. We know why there's a stuffing shortage. We've been trying to get the wormhole open.
Miles
I trust none but them! [points to the party he came with - Natalie, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] Indians hath betrayed us! I must return to Plymouth so my king can know the truth! [hurries away]
THC President
PLEASE! [stops him] We're the History Channel. We care as much about the truth as you do.
Miles
Then get us to Cape Cod as soon as possible!
Planet Plymouth. The king of Plymouth sits on his throne looking board
Pilgrim
[shot through with several arrows] My Lord! My Lord, the battle is lost! We have tried to stop the Indians on their home planet, but yea they are too strong!
Pilgrim King
Then our last chance for survival is gone?
Pilgrim
I'm sorry my Lord. All Pilgrim forces sent to the Indians' planet have been wiped out.
Pilgrim King
And so soon the Indians will be here. Sound the corn horn! We must abandon Plymouth!
The Indians and Pilgrims do battle on Indi
Indian Chief
The stuffing mines are ours! [some Indians celebrate at the mines]
Cape Cod, day. A wooden pathway has been built to Plymouth Rock and surrounds it. Miles uses a blown up version of his map to show the History Channel what's going on.
Miles
Earth is connected to Plymouth by this wormhole here. Once I get back I will assemble my people to attack Indi, and gain control of the stuffing mines. If all goes as planned, you will all have stuffing in time for Thanksgiving.
THC President
But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work.
Miles
Ah ha ha ha! Of course not! You have the correct symbol, but you are missing the keeper of the portal.
Agent 11
The keeper of the... of course! Natalie Portman!
THC President
We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!
Agent 12
Our window of opportunity is closing, sir! The wormhole has to be opened now!
THC President
Alright Ms. Portman, we need you to open your wormhole.
Natalie
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. No.
THC President
Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!
Natalie
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmm. [then to the right] Uh uh.
THC President
Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!
Natalie
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. No.
THC President
There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?! [everyone moves aside to reveal Kyle] What do we do, Professor Broflovski?
Kyle
I'm not a professor.
THC President
The History Channel said you were!
Kyle
You are the fucking History Channel!
Miles
[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] Please, Kyle of DeVry Institute. There is no more time for squabbles. The universe is at stake!
THC President
[walks up to Kyle and genuflects] You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here. [points to Kyle's heart.] You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.
A local restaurant nearby. Nice, upscale, with a string trio playing during dinner. Kyle is in his suit, Natalie is in a different dress
Kyle
So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
Natalie
I had a lot of really close friends growing up, but not any brothers and sisters; I was an only child.
Kyle
[having trouble with small talk] Wow, awesome. Um...
Natalie
I have dual citizenship in the United States and Israel. [a waiter with a bottle of wine walks by and Kyle snaps his fingers twice, then indicates to the waiter that Natalie should get some more wine. The waiter serves it] Oh thanks.
Kyle
Um... so... [behind him, everyone involved in the portal matter is watching them] So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
Natalie
Well, I went to Harvard while I was acting. I got a BA. But I did classes at the University of Jerusalem too.
Kyle
Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
Cape Cod, night. Kyle and Natalie walk down to Plymouth Rock
Natalie
Thanks, that was a lot of fun.
Kyle
Yeah, it was cool, thanks. [looks over his shoulder. Miles motions at him to continue] Um, so... Is there any way you'd
Natalie
What?
Kyle
You know, could youuu...
Natalie
What?
Kyle
Would you please just open your wormhole?!
Natalie
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Oh. [moves her torso to the right, then to the left] Mmmm... [moves her torso to the right] no.
Kyle
[sighs in exasperation] Errh!
Natalie
[rolls her eyes and moves her torso to the left, then to the right, then to the left] Mmmmmmmmmm. Okay.
Miles
Yes!
THC President
Alright, let's go, folks! [he and several other men go towards Plymouth Rock]
Natalie
Just for a sec though. [turns around and joins them]
Miles
Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!
Kyle
Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. [behind the rock, Natalie's legs go up in the air]
Stan
It's cool dude, we understand.
Kyle
I guess we should all realize... [the portal is activated] that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. [the portal shoots out into space towards planet Plymouth]
Miles
[rises with his sword unsheathed] Now make way, children! For I have a war to fight! [runs towards the rock, jumps on it, and into the portal stream] For stuffing!! [goes towards planet Plymouth]
The stuffing mines. The battle continues
Indian Chief
Take ALL their stuffing!
Pilgrim
The treaty ends now! [the Indians retreat as flying galleons sweep over the stuffing mines with powerful rays, destroying any Indians along the way]
Narrator
With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army.
Miles
Now attack their left flank! Good! They're retreating! Hit them with the anti-Indian device! [A destroyer walks in and obliterates all the Indians with its powerful beams]
Narrator
The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables.
Cartman's living room. The four boys are watching The History Channel once again, Stan and Kenny are watching the TV, Cartman is eating Cheesy Poofs, and Kyle looks on in annoyance.
Random Voices
Yea. Stuffing mines. Yea.
Narrator
And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving.
Stan
Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
Cartman
Yeah, History Channel rules.
Narrator
But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been... [an image of a woman appears against a wall] haunted!
Donald T. Brown
[Ph. D., University of Phoenix] There is certainly no evidence that the first Thanksgiving dinner was not haunted.
Narrator
The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave? [ghostly figures appear here and there.]
Cartman
[curious] Ohhh??
Kyle
[throws up his arms in exasperation] Oh, come on!!
End of A History Channel Thanksgiving

The Poor Kid
The McCormick house, living room. Stuart and Kevin are fighting as Mrs. McCormick carries Karen out of harm's way. Kenny's on the sofa watching TV, ignoring all the drama around him.
Stuart
You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!
Kevin
Yes, 'cause you're a drunk piece of shit, Dad!
Mrs. McCormick
You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!
Kevin
Shut up!
Kenny's watching a show that will have an unexpected twist. Right in front of the TV is an empty can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Random images of white trash culture pop up. The first one is a trailer with an awning
Announcer
They're noisy.
Man 1
Fuck you, bitch! [runs out of the trailer]
Woman 1
[throws an unlabeled crumpled empty bottle at him] Fuck you, you son of a bitch! [the man turns around and walks back to the trailer to hit her]
next is a backyard fight between two women. A blonde is holding a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer
Announcer
They're nasty.
Woman 2
[redhead, to a blonde] You done spilled that on my titties, skank! [shoves her off her feet, taking the beer the blonde was holding and finishing it off]
Woman 3
Oww...
Announcer
They're white trash. And when you give them a little Pabst Blue Ribbon [an image of the beer bottle fills the screen], they can't help getting arrested. [Kevin picks up a block and throws it at Stuart, hitting him on the forehead. Onscreen, police break up a fight among several men] Tonight, on an all-new... White Trash... In Trouble!
A narrator appears on screen, wearing a beige overcoat, standing in a graffiti-riddled set
Narrator
Pabst Blue Ribbon and white trash. It's a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home. This white trash home in Colorado seems innocent enough. [The McCormick home is shown]
Kenny
[sits up upon recognizing the house] (Hmmm. What the fuck?) [goes to see what's going on. Stuart and Kevin continue to fight, and Mrs. McCormick tries to intervene, only to have Stuart slap her.]
Narrator
But the children in this home live in a world of neglect. There's no heating, no groceries, [a spotlight pans around the back yard] and if you look closely in the backyard, you can even make out what appears to be a meth lab. [a red arrow points to a small shed against the house which does indeed have a meth lab in it. Kenny looks out a window next to the back door.]
Kenny
[runs back to warn his parents] (Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) [Kevin has gotten on Stuart's back and is choking him. At the front door, police make use of a battering ram to get into the house. They all rush in and surround the family]
Cops
Down on the ground! Move it! Let's go! Move move! Get down, now! [The parents get on their knees and put their hands behind their heads. Ten officers end up in the living room with guns drawn. There are twice as many officers outside.]
The McCormick house, outside, night. The parents have been arrested and are escorted out by police. The kids walk out freely
Mrs. McCormick
No! Muh babies! Don't take my babies!
Stuart
[taken to one car] You're hurting my arm!
Mrs. McCormick
[taken to another] My babies!
Stuart
You're hurting me!
Officer 1
You have the right to remain silent. Now please look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
Stuart
I'm white trash and I'm in trouble. ["IN TROUBLE" is stamped on the screen right away. This happens after every admission of "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."]
Officer 1
Alright, good. Now get in the car! [Stuart gets in. A crowd gathers to view this scene]
Cartman
[filming with his phone] Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence. [chuckles and waves with his left hand] Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave! [to his phone] That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
Officer 2
Just have a seat in there, kids. [puts the kids into the back seat]
Kevin
[still drunk, but mocking] Just have a seat in there, kids. [the cop closes the door]
Park County Police Station, later.
Officer 1
The mother and father will probably be released from jail on Monday, but I guess the kids are gonna be taken away for good. Child Protective Services is about to talk to them in the soft room.
Officer 3
The soft room?
Officer 1
You know, the room we have set aside for kids to feel safe in.
The soft room. It's a room with large pictures of friendly-faced clowns on all four walls. Against the walls are toys and games for small kids to enjoy as they wait. The McCormick kids sit on a sofa, looking around the room scared at the clown pictures. The door opens and a heavy-set man walks in.
Mr. Adams
Hi kids, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams and I just need to get some info from you. Does that sound okay?
Karen
[scared, sniffling, she holds on to Kenny] Can I see my mommy?
Mr. Adams
No, sorry. Now, [opens a folder] I've been looking over your file and I see you kids have all been horribly physically and emotionally abused. [the kids look at him in astonishment] Oh whoops, that isn't your case file, it's the Penn State University Gazette. [laughs] I'm joking, that's just a joke, we like to have fun here. [closes the folder and shows it to the kids] It is your case file. I was just all like "it's the Penn State Gazette" to be like a joke, we have fun. Now listen, you're gonna be put into a foster home, so I need to know... would you like to go to Neverland Ranch, a Catholic church, or Penn State University? [laughs at his own joke] We're havin' fun here, aren't we? I just, I come up with these and the guys, it's good to laugh. [goes to the door and yells into the hall] I just asked them if they wanted to go to Neverland, a Catholic church, or Penn State. [closes the door and returns to his chair] I'm a trickster. People say I'm really meant for comedy. Here's my head shot just in case you know anybody. [shows his picture, then hands out copies to the kids] Can't hurt, right? Okay, now, are we all startin' to feel a little bit better? [Karen cries] Oh come on now, how about that smile? I'm gonna GET [holds out his right palm] you to smile! I'm gonna GET [holds out his right palm again] you to smile! [silence] A Penn State administrator walks into a bar. Where's that smile? How about this one? Joe Paterno doesn't walk into a police station. Come on, that's a good one.
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallway. Stan walks over to Kyle
Stan
Did you hear anything more about what happened?
Kyle
Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
Stan
We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
Cartman
[runs up to the other two with a memo pad] Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
Stan
Really?
Cartman
Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
Kyle
That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
Cartman
Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo- [noticing Craig coming into view] sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes. [as Craig passes by] Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? [stifles a laugh]
Craig
What are you talking about?
Cartman
Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. [stifles a laugh]
A rundown two-story house somewhere, day. Two police officers arrive with the McCormick kids at their new home, A man answers the door as his wife stands some distance away from it.
Officer 2
Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, we have the new foster kids for your care. [the kids enter]
Mr. Weatherhead
Very good, we'll take them from here. Children, enter. [the kids walk in further, the cops leave, Mr. Weatherhead closes the door, and Mrs. Weatherhead's face gets stern] Welcome to your new home. Before we show you around let's get one thing clear: this is a very strict religious household! As long as you live here you will be agnostic! [leads the children to a group of nine other kids] These are your foster brothers and sisters! They are all strict agnostics! David, do you believe in God?!
David
[blond boy with glasses] I don't know...
Mr. Weatherhead
Right! There are two bedrooms upstairs! Boys' room and girls' room! Your chores are listed on their respective doors! Follow! [guides them into the kitchen] You will eat only at designated meal times! Beverages you may take from the refrigerator as you like! However, in this house you will drink only agnostic beverages! [opens the refrigerator door to reveal the contents] Dr Pep-er, and Diet Dr Pep-er! [takes out a can and shows it to the kids] Because what flavor is it?! It is neither root beer nor cola! Nobody is sure what flavor it is, and nobody can be sure! Isn't that right, Melissa?!
Melissa
[ginger girl] I don't know.
Mr. Weatherhead
Good!
South Park Elementary Computer Lab, day. Butters is doing research for Cartman as Cartman watches.
Cartman
This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
Butters
Yep. To find out who the poorest kid is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
Cartman
Eh yeah?
Butters
So then I cross-referenced all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
Cartman
[laughs] Heh heh, yeah?
Butters
Well actually, Eric, it's you. [Cartman keeps his smile for a few seconds more, then frowns.]
Cartman
What?
Butters
Now that Kenny's gone, [points to Cartman] your household actually has the lowest income. [Cartman is stunned, then dejected. Butters consoles him] I'm sorry, pal.
Cartman
[hops off his chair and moves off a bit, then gets a panicked look] Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
Butters
Uh, I won't tell anybody.
Cartman
[turns around and glares at Butters] Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew! [makes a fist, then crosses his arms] Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
South Park Elementary, hallway. Bill and Red are chatting, Lola talks to Bebe. As the kids mill around, Cartman comes around the corner and moves from person to person as he speaks.
Cartman
Alright, let's hear it for Kyle! [claps] He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! Yeah, that's super funny, guys! [Stan and Kyle turn from their lockers to look at him] Laugh it up, everyone! [ends up by Stan and Kyle] Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
Kyle
[slowly so that there's no mistake] My name. Is not. "Kyel".
Cartman
That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! [runs away]
The Cartman residence, the same day. Liane enters the living room with groceries and sees her son on the armchair.
Liane
Hi, sweetie.
Cartman
[sighs] Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
Liane
[sets the groceries on the floor] Oh, what is it this time? [sits down on the sofa]
Cartman
Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
Liane
What, hon?
Cartman
You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
Liane
Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.
Cartman
Yeah, see, the problem, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kid in skewl!
Liane
Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.
Cartman
[trying to get this straight] We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You can't just sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
Liane
Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
Cartman
Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
Liane
Oh. [laughs]
Cartman
IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! [runs off]
Cartman's room, night. Cartman is on his bed crying
Cartman
My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
The Weatherhead house, night. There are cows everywhere and no pavement on the sidewalk or path to the house. In the girls' room there are six girls, and one of them is crying while the others sleep. It's Karen. A shadow comes over her and she stops crying when she notices. She gets on her knees in bed
Karen
Huh? [calms down] Oh, it's you. [smiles. In the window is Mysterion!] I was wondering when you'd appear. You always come when I'm sad.
Mysterion
You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!
Karen
Why did my mommy and daddy go to jail?
Mysterion
[thinks a moment] Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late.
Karen
But I'm all alone now.
Mysterion
You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?
Karen
I'll try, guardian angel.
Mysterion
Don't try, Karen. Do. [the bedroom light comes on]
Mr. Weatherhead
What in the name of nobody knows are you doing, Karen?! [she looks back at him, then at the window. Mysterion is gone. Mr. Weatherhead goes to the window and looks out to see what Karen was looking at. Failing to see him, he closes the windows and keeps vigil for a bit]
Park County Police Station. A phone rings and one of the officers answers it.
Officer 4
Police man. [starts taking notes] Yes. Yes. Alright, thanks for the tip. We'll check it out. [hangs up] Better call the lieutenant. Looks like we've got another meth lab in town.
The Cartman house, night. The front yard is full of police, and a few of them are inside, as seen through the open front door. Liane is being arrested and nearby are two suitcases
Officer 5
Got any needles on you? Any crack pipes?
Liane
Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.
Officer 5
Then why is there a meth lab in your backyard?
Cartman
[comes down the stairs in a Hawaiian shirt] What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then. [walks over to the suitcases and grabs the handles] Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away? [turns left and begins to walk out] It's gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
Officer 5
When will you people learn to lay off the Pabst Blue Ribbon? Now look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
Liane
Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.
Park County Police Station, day, the soft room. Cartman sits there waiting for Mr. Adams, who soon enters.
Mr. Adams
Hi there, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services. [sits down, but just as quickly gets up] Here's my head shot. [gives Cartman a picture of himself] I just need to get some information from you if that's okay.
Cartman
[sets the picture aside] Yeah, yeah.
Mr. Adams
Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab.
Cartman
That's right.
Mr. Adams
And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here.
Cartman
Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
Mr. Adams
We just - no, we just like to have fun here.
Cartman
Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! [Mr. Adams doesn't look too happy]
Mr. Adams
What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny?
Cartman
A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
Mr. Adams
Could be worse.
Cartman
How?!
Mr. Adams
Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?
Cartman
Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
Mr. Adams
[sighs] Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt-!
On the road, day. Two police officers drive Cartman towards his new foster home
Cartman
Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
Officer 6
Hawaii?
Cartman
Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
Officer 7
Your foster home is here, pretty much the exact opposite of Hawaii.
Cartman
What?? [looks out the window. A sign on the side of the road says "Welcome to Greeley, 'The Exact Opposite of Hawaii" Please drive safely" A crow stands on top of the sign] Greeley?
The Weatherhead residence, same day. The kids are mopping, dusting, sweeping, or scrubbing the dining room area. Kenny is scrubbing the floor while Karen sweeps up nearby with a push broom. One boy is vacuuming the throw rug in the living room. Mr. Weatherhead walks by
Mr. Weatherhead
Come on now! This is not the way we've told you to tidy up! Remember? Cleanliness is next to godliness, so make it kind of clean but not too much! Amanda! More ambiguous on the dusting! [there's a knock on the door] Kenneth, answer the door! [Kenny gets up and walks to the front door, opens it, and allows Cartman in and closes the door]
Cartman
What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
Kenny
(What the fuck are you doing here?!)
Mrs. Weatherhead
Hello Eric, your room is upstairs on the left. Are you hungry?
Cartman
You're my new mom?
Mrs. Weatherhead
You can call me Mom if you like.
Cartman
Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
Upstairs. The boys' room is opened and Mr. Weatherhead shows Cartman in.
Mr. Weatherhead
This is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers. You will be clean, polite, and most importantly, you WILL follow the agnostic code: We cannot know with certainty if God or Christ exists. They COULD. Then again there COULD be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything. Can we be CERTAIN there isn't? NO, so it's pointless to talk about. Now say it with me.
Cartman
Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
Mr. Weatherhead
HEY! We do not take the Lord's name in vain in this house, just in case there is one! Do you understand, or do you need the punishment room?!
Cartman
Oh heell naw! [yells into the hallway] Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! [Mrs. Weatherhead walks in]
Mrs. Weatherhead
My name. Is not. Meom!
Greeley Elementary, day. There are cows all over the campus and the building is even plainer than South Park Elementary's. Inside, Cartman walks with Kenny and Karen down the hallway
Cartman
Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
Karen
I'll see you at recess, right?
Kenny
(I'll be there, Karen.) [Karen walks into her classroom]
Cartman
You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! [Kenny walks up to a group of his new friends]
Boy 1
[with thick wavy hair] Oh hey, Kenny. Who's this?
Kenny
(This is Eric Cartman.)
Boy 2
[the tall one] Does he live with you at the foster home?
Cartman
[moves past Kenny] Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
Boy 1
What are you talking about? The poor kid in this school is Jacob Hallery. [Hallery is shown seated on some steps, looking unkempt and eating moldy bread]
Cartman
Really?
Boy 2
Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.
Cartman
[jumps for joy] YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school! [runs up to Jacob]
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!

Boy 1
Did he do stuff like this at your old school?
Kenny
(Uh huh.)
Cartman
Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom is so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. [laughs even harder]
The principal's office, later. Cartman is facing the principal now.
Principal
Eric, at Greeley Elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students.
Cartman
I wasn't making fun of anybody.
Principal
[reading from a report about the incident] A twenty-minute song and dance number with forty seven "Yo momma so poor" jokes directed at Jacob Hallery, which ended in a finale with fireworks.
Cartman
I was just teasing.
Principal
Your case worker has been notified, and he is not happy.
Cartman
My case worker? [looks over his shoulder and sees Mr. Adams walk in] Oh, not this guy!
Mr. Adam
I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, Eric! But you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself! I mean, what do you think this is?! The shower room at Penn State?! I'm kidding. We like to have fun in our department, so I was like, I was like, "What? Is this like the shower room at Penn State?!" I joke around. This is my head shot. [hands the principal a picture of himself]
Cartman
Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking something topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
Mr. Adams
[a few seconds of silence] Oh! Oh, and "your momma" jokes are better?! They've been around since the '50s!
Principal
[exasperated, he pounds both fists on the desk] What the hell does this have to do with anything?!
Girl 1
Principal, you've gotta send help to the playground! They're about to beat up that new kid!
The playground outside. Karen has been singled out and the other kids close in on her.
Jessica
Aww, look at the new kid and her wittle dolly. You gonna cry some more in class, wimp?!
Boy 3
L-leave her alone.
Jessica
Shut up! You foster twerps are all the same! Come on! Hand over the doll! [from on high Mysterion drops down in front of Karen] Who the hell is this?!
Mysterion
How about you find another little girl to pick on?
Jessica
Mind your business, Peter Pan! [Mysterion kicks her in the stomach, then gives her a flying punch across the face which leads to a black eye, and punches her again, leading to her falling on her face]
Mysterion
[pulling Jessica's head up by her hair] Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! [drops some Chinese fireworks as a distraction while he takes Karen up to the roof.]
The Weatherhead house, night. The family is at table. Mr. Weatherhead leads grace as Mrs. Weatherhead serves dinner individually.
Mr. Weatherhead
And if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence, we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence. Nobody knows, nobody can know if any deity is watching over us. Amen.
Boy 4
Except for Karen's guardian angel.
Mr. Weatherhead
What?
Melissa
Where did he take you after he saved you, Karen?
Karen
He just took me back to my classroom. Then he disappeared like always.
Mr. Weatherhead
[pounds the table] What have we told you about making up angel stories?!
Girl 3
But we SAW him. He leaped down from the sky.
David
And he kicked the crap out of Jessica Pinkerton. [the other kids begin to chime in]
Mrs. Weatherhead
[moving quickly to the head of the table] Stop it, children! We do not speak such certainties in this house!
Mr. Weatherhead
Get down to the basement, all of you! It's time for the Punishment Room! [Kenny gets angry]
The basement, also known as the Punishment Room, later. David is now tied up and dangling from one of the beams. Mrs. Weatherhead douses him with a torrent of Dr Pep-er. The Weatherheads have kegs of it down there.
David
AAAAAAAH!
Mr. Weatherhead
Now, did you see an angel?!
David
No, I - no - I didn't see an angel.
Mr. Weatherhead
No, you can't be certain of that! You might've seen one! [to his wife] Hit him with the Dr Pep-er again. [the wife lets loose the drink once again, then stops] Are there such things as angels?!
David
Maybe.
Mr. Weatherhead
Good! [the wife lets loose the drink once again]
Karen
What do we do, Kenny? [Kenny isn't there] Kenny?
Mr. Weatherhead
What is the meaning of life?!
David
It's impossible to knoooow!
Mr. Weatherhead
That's right! [a knock is soon heard, and it's persistent]
Mrs. Weatherhead
Who could that be? [the adults go upstairs and to the front door to answer it]
Mr. Adams
Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?
Cartman
Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
Mr. Weatherhead
What business is that of yours?!
Mr. Adams
It's my business because Child Protective Services is accountable for these kids! [he now talks more calmly] Have I given you my head shot?
Mrs. Weatherhead
Yes, yes, we have that.
Mr. Adams
Okay now, are you only giving these kids Dr Pepper to drink?
Mr. Weatherhead
If we want to serve agnostic beverages in this house, then by Goddish we'll do it! The children you've sent here are undisciplined and talking about the certainty of angels! [a window breaks upstairs and the Weatherheads go up to see where it broke]
Mr. Adams
Excuse me! [waits, then sighs] Let's have a look around.
Upstairs, the Weatherheads enter the girls' room and find the walls covered in colored question marks - the sign of Mysterion. The Weatherheads walk towards the window
Mr. Weatherhead
What the? Who did this?
Mrs. Weatherhead
What is that? [Mysterion turns right and runs down the hallway and into the boys' room. The Weatherheads follow suit and find Mysterion squatting on the window sill. Mysterion drops down and out of view. The Weatherheads reach the window]
Mrs. Weatherhead
It was like a... little mystery person... flying around.
Mr. Weatherhead
Almost like some kind of... agnostic angel. [notices a note pinned to the outside wall with a knife. He removes the note and reads it. "Look in the fridge."]
The basement. Mr. Adams and Cartman get to the floor and Mr. Adams finds the door to the Punishment Room locked, so he decides to run into it. This proves successful, and Mr. Adams gets to see what his work has led to.
Mr. Adams
Oh my God. [David is still dangling from the beam and the other kids are still in the corner by the water heater] What's going on here?
David
[softly] We don't know... We can't possibly know...
Mr. Adams
[leans back on the door frame] What have I done? [sits in the doorway with his head in his hands] I took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going! I put innocent children into a dangerous environment! What am I, a recruitment coach for Penn State? [begins to cry. Cartman laughs] It's not funny!
The ground floor. The Weatherheads make their way slowly to the refrigerator.
Mr. Weatherhead
There's nothing in there but Dr Pepper, right? There can't be. [inside is one can of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer with a question mark attached to it with a spring. Mrs. Weatherhead opens the door quickly and finds the can]
Mrs. Weatherhead
Ohhh...
Mr. Weatherhead
How did that get here?! [takes the can out, and his wife closes the door] It says it's a Pabst Blue Ribbon.
Mrs. Weatherhead
What is it?
Mr. Weatherhead
[opens the can and takes a sip] It's like beer... but different. [hands it to his wife]
Mrs. Weatherhead
[takes a sip] But how did it get here? [they begin to take turns sipping the beer.]
Outside. Greeley police cars have pulled up and cops have poured out. Some of them are taking the Weatherheads out of the house as the foster kids watch.
Mr. Weatherhead
Shut your mouth, bitch!
Mrs. Weatherhead
You shut your mouth, you filth-fucking asshole!
Mr. Weatherhead
Fuck you, bitch!
Greeley Officer 1
You have the right to remain silent. Now look at the camera and say "I'm white trash and I'm in trouble."
Mrs. Weatherhead
I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
Greeley Officer 2
Get in the car, you!
Mr. Weatherhead
Wait a minute, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble?
Mr. Adams
No, no, take all these kids back to their parents! We've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of! It's like a Penn State homecoming party! [covers his face and begins to cry. Nearby, Cartman is already in the back seat of a cruiser as a third cop talks to him]
Greeley Officer 3
A false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term, son.
Cartman
I'm not saying it.
Greeley Officer 3
We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard!
Cartman
I'm not saying it!
Greeley Officer 3
Then we'll add another charge for resisting!
Cartman
Okay, fine! [turns to the camera] I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
Narrator
Three arrests in just one power-packed episode, proving once again that we are all just one Pabst Blue Ribbon away from becoming... white trash in trouble! Sponsored by Schlitz.
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are once again in the hallway, but this time they're cheering Kenny's return
Stan
Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
Kenny
(Thanks, Stan.)
Kyle
I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
Kenny
(Good for me.)
Cartman
[walks up] There he is, there's my buddy.
Kyle
How was jail, fatass?!
Cartman
Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-

[a giant reptilian bird's head smashes through the roof and second floor of the school and the kids clear out as the head looks around]

Kids
Aaaah! [the beak grabs Kenny and swings him back and forth between the lockers]
Kenny
(AAAAHH!) [the bird opens its mouth and swallows Kenny, then flies away. The kids look through the massive hole left by the bird]
Stan
...What the fuck?!
Cartman
[begins to cry and walk away while Kyle stares angrily at him] Aww, my mom is so poor she walks down the road with one shoooe. [backs up] And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say "No, I found ooone."
End of The Poor Kid

Reverse Cowgirl
The Donovan house. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Clyde are playing football in the backyard.
Stan
Throw it here! Throw it here! [Clyde throws the ball.] Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! [Clyde's mom shouts through the window.]
Betsy
Clyde! Clyde! Clyde, get up here! Hurry! [Clyde runs in with panic. The boys follow him.]
Betsy is waiting Clyde in the bathroom with an angry expression. Clyde comes in and the other boys wait him outside.
Betsy
[points at the toilet] What is that?
Clyde
A toilet?
Betsy
That's right. It's a toilet, Clyde. And where is the toilet seat? It's up, because you left it up, again! We've been through this countless times, Clyde.
Clyde
Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?
Betsy
No, not okay. Because you aren't getting the message! What if I'd fallen in? Start listening to me! Put it down! Put it down! [Clyde hurriedly puts it down. Betsy walks to the door] Thank you. [Clyde stands alone, embarrassed.]
Cartman
[whistles] Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
Kyle
Is your mom always like that dude?
Clyde
Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
Cartman
[puts his arm on Clyde] Of course, man. It's cool.
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in class.
Cartman
[imitating Clyde's mom] Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like "Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! [He laughs, Butters joins him.]
Kyle
Cartman, it was actually really lame.
Cartma
I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
Butters
[laughs] Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out? [looks around] But I thought you sit on the toilet this way. [demonstrates by sitting backwards on his chair] So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No? [turns around] Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
Betsy
[offscreen] Clyde! Clyde! [comes in wearing a nightgown, a coat and slippers] There you are!
Clyde
Mom?
Betsy
Clyde Donovan, you come home this instant!
Clyde
Why?
Betsy
What have I told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom?
Clyde
Mom, I'm in class.
Betsy
How many times do I have to tell you Clyde? I was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up, again.
Roger
Betsy, come back home. It's just not that big a deal.
Betsy
No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina.
Butters
My grandma is from Virginia. [smiles]
Betsy
You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go.
Clyde
[Looks down in embarrassment, leaves the classroom.]
The Cartman house, night. Cartman is lying on his bed with his pajamas on and he is cutting his toenails and eating Thwizlers while talking on the phone.
Cartman
Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
The Broflovski house, night. Kyle is talking on the phone while his family is seen eating dinner behind.
Kyle
I know, fatass. I was there.
Cartma
His mom... His mom goes: "Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay."
Kyle
That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
Cartman
I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
Kyle
Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
Cartman
Nuh-uh.
Kyle
Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. [police siren is heard offscreen.]
The Donovan house, night. The police, firefighters, ambulance and a crowd of people has gathered around the house. A ladder is placed to reach the second floor window. The camera pans to Stan and Kenny with Kyle approaching them.
Kyle
What's going on?
Stan
They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
Kyle
From what?
Stan
They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
The Donovan's bathroom. Betsy is stuck in the toilet, moaning and desperately trying to get herself out. Three firemen, a paramedics figure and Clyde are standing beside her.
Fireman 1
Hang it there. You're going to be fine okay? Stay with me now. [Another fireman approaches Roger.]
Fireman 2
I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.
Roger
What?!
Fireman 2
When she fell into the toilet, she also made it flush. It created a suction that's literally pulling out her insides.
Roger
Can't we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing?
Paramedic
Yes, we'll have to, but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs.
Clyde
But she's not gonna die, is she?
Fireman 2
Why did you leave the toilet seat up, son?
Betsy
Clyde! Clyde! [Clyde goes next to her.] Clyde, I want you to know I don't blame you for this. We should have been h-h-harder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up.
Clyde
Mom, I'm sorry.
Betsy
Shhh! Sh! I.. don't... have a lot of time, Clyde. Just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sister's sake, please. Oh, God, please let me go. Let me go. Do it! Do it! Do it! [The third fireman shuts off the plumbing. Betsy screams while her organs are pulled out, then stops, apparently dead.]
Clyde
Mom?
The church. It's the funeral of Betsy Donovan. A plain chant is heard. Stephen Stotch is giving his speech.
Stephen
I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect. [The camera zooms out. Betsy's corpse in the coffin is seen with a heavy make-up and a pink dress, yet still stuck in the toilet.] What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet. [Sharon and Sheila look at each other in disbelief.]
Linda
I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. [all the women start to applause]
Women
Yeah, yes. That's right.
Man With Grey Hair
[reads from a paper] Putting the toilet seat down isn't that hard. So is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl?
Woman With Brown Hair
My God, people. This is a funeral! Please have some respect! There's a little boy here who has lost his mother! [Clyde is shown, looking down in sorrow] He'll never see her again, because he couldn't take that sixth-tenths of a second to put the seat down when he was done peeing. [camera shows the woman again] And now little Clyde's mother is dead, and the blood is on his penis. [organ music is played]
The Cartman house, day. Two men from the TSA ring on the door. Cartman is watching Terrance and Phillip while eating cereal.
Terrance
Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
Phillip
Oh, hello, Ugly Bob. [the doorbell rings again]
Ugly Bob
Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip.
Cartman
Mom, get the door! [Liane walks in to answer the door]
Terrance
You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
Ugly Bob
How come you guys say stuff like that?
Phillip
Because you're goddamn ugly... [The sound from the TV fades away]
TSA Agent 1
Hello ma'am, we're the Toilet Safety Administration.
Liane
The what?
TSA Agent 2
After the recent tragedy, new safety regulations require us to check every toilet for security. Can we come in?
Liane
Oh sure. [The TSA employees come in and go upstairs to the bathroom.]
Cartman
Who are these buttholes?
Liane
It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.
Cartman
My potty? What are they going to do to it? [runs upstairs]
The hallway. The TSA employees enter the bathroom while Cartman runs after them.
Cartman
Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! [Liane follows him]
The bathroom.
TSA Agent 1
Oh yeah, we're gonna have to completely redo this ma'am.
Liane
Oh.
TSA Agent 1
You need to have this counter moved to a minimum of six inches, but we'll go ahead and install your safety belt.
Liane
Safety belt?
TSA Agent 2
Federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in.
Cartman
Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
TSA Agent 2
This is for your safety. A woman died, you know.
Cartman
Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
Hoffman & Turk Law Office. Clyde, Kyle, Stan and Jimmy are talking to an attorney who is reading a case file.
Kyle
Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
Attorney
Uh-uh, go on.
Stan
We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
Kyle
So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
Attorney
You can always sue somebody.
Kyle
All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
Attorney
You got it. [types on his computer] Here we go, the inventor of the toilet. [the camera shows the webpage he's reading, which turns out to be a Wickie page] Sir Thomas Harrington. In England, died in 1692.
Kyle
Aw, he's dead?
Stan
So then we can't sue him?
Attorney
Why not? You can always sue somebody. It's just gonna take some special protocol. We would have to perform a sue-ance. [spooky music, lightning and thunder follow]
Jimmy
A...a...a...a sue-ance?
Attorney
You bet. Here at Hoffman and Turk we specialize in suing the dead. If you hire us, we'll work hard, for you.
Stan
Wow, really?!
Kyle
[puts his arm around Clyde] You hear that Clyde?
Attorney
Now look. I'll be asking all of you to have a very open mind and a willingness to face you fears. [draws a curtain] I warn you boys. A sue-ance can be very... expensive.
Stan
How expensive?
Attorney
How much do you have?
Kyle
Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
Attorney
Wow! That's exactly how much a sue-ance costs. [Dramatic music plays. The camera zooms to the man, then pans to the boys.]
Jimmy
Wow, that's weird.
Randy is sitting on a toilet. He yawns, then farts. A ladder is put on the window, with a cop on it knocking on the window
Randy
Aw, damn it. [reaches the seatbelt. The cop knocks again, so he opens the window.] He, hey officer.
Officer
If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir.
Randy
Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
Officer
The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?
Randy
Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
Officer
Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.
Randy
I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. [puts his belt on]
Officer
The law is the law sir. [hands over the ticket] You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir. [leaves]
Randy
Yeah thanks. [under his breath] Asshole.
Officer
[comes up] You say something?
Randy
No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. [the cop leaves]
International House of Pancakes (IHOP), day. Cartman and Butters are in the long line for the bathroom. Butters looks impatient because of retaining his pee.
Cartman
This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
R. Booth
Shoes off, belts off! Sharp objects go in the plastic tray!
Man 1
This is inhumane.
R. Booth
Shut up! Sir.
Two TSA agents are examining a woman for the toilet pass.
R. Wiley
Taking a dump today, ma'am?
Woman 2
No, just need to pee.
R. Wiley
I'll just need to check inside your aaasshole. [Cartman comes in]
Cartman
Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
R. Wiley
All right, do you mind if I touch your balls, sir?
Cartman
What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
Gerald
[flushes and comes out the toilet cabin] Okay, I'm done.
R. Wiley
Alright, sir. I just need to check inside your aaasshole. [takes out a handkerchief and starts wiping his butt]
Gerald
I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
R. Wiley
Yes, you're a big boy, aren't you, sir?
Gerald
Yeah, I'm a big boy.
R. Wiley
That's a big boy, sir.
Gerald
I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
R. Wiley
Yes.
Stan, Kyle, Clyde, Jimmy and the attorney are sitting around a table in a dark room. The attorney lights two candles.
Attorney
Alright boys, sit down and clear your minds. The sue-ance is about to begin. Doors and windows are locked. You boys have your $500 in cash ready?
Stan
[holds the money] Yeah.
Attorney
Alright. Then I've got this big bowl set here to catch all money we're about to make. Now. Let us start. [holds hands with Jimmy and Clyde, then closes his eyes, so does Jimmy] We call out to the land of the dead. Sir John Harrington. Your presence is requested. Appear to us, John Harrington. We have a subpoena.
Jimmy
Jeez, it's not working.
Attorney
John Harrington. My client is due compensation for negligence. [a creepy music plays. The table starts to rock, much to the Stan and Kyle's surprise.] What is your name, spirit?
Spirit
[offscreen] Burns. Jimmy Burns. What's it to you? Who are you, mugs?
Attorney
[under his breath] That's how people talked in the past. [to the spirit] We have a claim against a John Harrington. Do you know him, spirit?
Burns
Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't. Might need a little something to jar my memory.
Attorney
We gotta grease him. Put a hundred in the box. [Stan puts the money. The money disappears with a sparkling effect.]
Burns
Oh yeah, Harrington. I know him. Always going round inventing things.
Attorney
Yes, that's him. Is his personage amongst you?
Burns
Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't.
Attorney
Give him another hundred. [Stan puts the money, it disappears like the previous one]
Burns
Yeah, I've seen him around, alright. He was just down that way, bragging about some porcelain machine and whatever. [the table rocks]
Spirit 2
Nooo! Nooooo!
Attorney
By the power of Christ, we sue you! [fireworks start to pop] By the power of Christ, we sue you!
Spirit 2
You can't sue me! [the drawers around the room move]
Attorney
Quick, put the other $300 in the box! [Stan tosses the money. The attorney swings the box, gasping for breath.] This actually went really, really well. Always happens some bureaucrat tries to block the first sue-ance attempt, but this was good. We'll get him tomorrow.
Clyde
So that's it?
Attorney
Yeah, we're gonna need about 400 more dollars tomorrow. I know you're sad about your mom, Clyde, but don't worry. We're going to win this thing.
The Marsh house, morning. Randy walks in the hallway to the toilet. He is in his morning gown, hold a coffee in his hand.
The toilet. The two TSA agents from IHOP are there. R. Wiley is sitting behind a plastic tray.
R. Wiley
Put your coffee in the plastic tray please, sir.
R. Booth
Shoes off. Belts off.
Rand
[takes off his gown] Yeah yeah.
R. West
Got any metal in your pockets?
R. Wiley
I just need to check your asshole.
Randy
[sighs, then turns around, lowering his pants] So ridiculous.
R. Wiley
[examines his ass with a flashlight] Asshole clear.
Randy
[puts his pants on] Thanks.
R. West
Pick your coffee up, sir. [Randy picks his coffee, then heads to the toilet]
R. Wiley
Anyways, he says I'm getting nothing anyway, so then you can...
Randy
[points away] Hey, what's that thing? [a camera]
R. Wiley
That's a camera. It's a security camera.
Randy
Aw, you people have me on camera now?
R. West
It's okay, sir. There's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location.
The TSA security camera monitoring room. There is one guy apparently masturbating over the view of hundreds of people in bathrooms.
South Park Community Center. Cartman is giving his speech
Cartman
Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
People
Yeah.
Cartman
Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
Mr. Garrison
Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws. [the crowd cheers]
Jimbo
Alright, let's do it.
Sheila
No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.
Man 3
No, we won't.
Woman 3
Yeah, you will.
Cartman
Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
Woman 4
How about we agree to that, if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate.
Stephen
Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?
Randy
Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
Man 4
What about us loggers? Hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine?
Cartman
Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
Man 4
But folks been logging round these parts for generations. My pappy taught me logging. And his pappy before him.
Randy
Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. [several men say 'Yeah' agreeing him]
The dark room. Stan, Kyle, Clyde, Jimmy and the attorney are sitting around the same table. The attorney is holding hands with Jimmy and Clyde with his eyes closed.
Attorney
Oh, oohh! The spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena. Motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff? Ah, aaaah!
Jimmy
What's happening now?
Attorney
Our motion has been denied by the judge. [the drawers begin to move] Concentrate boys! [holds the box tight. The drawers stop, the attorney heaves a sigh of relief] This specter is like none I have ever encountered. I managed to avert liability within injunction against out claim.
Stan
So what does that mean?
Attorney
We'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow. We'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each.
Kyle
[frowning] What?
Attorney
Hang in there, Clyde. This is all to make the world a safer place.
The security camera monitoring room. Squishy sounds arise while the monitor guy masturbates. He clicks on the monitor's button a couple of times to change the channel, then stops at a woman reading book while taking a dump. He changes the channel some more, and then takes some bit of the moisturizing lotion on the table to put on his penis. He keeps on changing the channel until the view of Cartman standing with an angry face appears. He keeps looking at the monitor while rubbing his penis, though his motions get more interrupted. Cartman puts a gun on a stool, brings in a baby and R. Wiley, bound and gagged. He climbs up a small ladder and sprays the camera with black spray paint. The man's expression changes to a concerned look. He reaches to the microphone.
Monitor Man
Security breeeach!
The news.
Reporter
An embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration. Shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through TSA security with a gun and a baby. Leaving the toilet seat up. The head TSA chief of operations had this to say:
R. West is shown sitting on an outside table in a park.
R. West
Shiiiit!
Reporter
Meanwhile, outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy.
Park County Community Center, day. A huge crowd has gathered in front of the building. Cartman is standing in front of the crowd, and Randy is behind the pulpit
Randy
What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
Woman 5
And the toilet seat was up.
Randy
We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
Cartman
That's right.
Randy
Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
Cartman
Yeah.
Randy
It is time for us all to grow up.
Cartman
That's right.
Randy
It is time for a sue-ance.
People
Yeah.
Cartman
Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
Colorado State Courthouse. A news reporter is standing outside the building.
Reporter 2
Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor Sir John Harrington. Now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead, lawyers are gonna try and sue him.
The court. A trial is hold. The judge has a bored look on his face.
Attorney
Sir Thomas Harrington, your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions.
Spirit
No! No!
Attorney
You will be sued, spirit. Thy liability is without question. [the table before the attorney moves. Jimmy, Clyde, Cartman, Stan and Kyle are shown sitting there.] Appear before this court, Harrington.
Spirit
Never!
Attorney
Quick, everyone, get our all your money. [the light goes out and the table rocks. A bright light appears above the judge accompanied by an echoed voice. It turns out to be Betsy's ghost.]
Betsy
Clyde? Clyde?
Clyde
Mom?
Betsy
[points to the attorney] This lawyer is a fraud. He has been swindling you and your friends for your money.
Attorney
Fuck me, it's a ghost.
Betsy
You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde!
Cartman
Oh boy, here we go.
Betsy
Don't try and blame mommy's death on anything but your failure to something I have asked you time and time again to do. [camera pans to Clyde] It's your fault!
Spirit 2
[offscreen] Now hold on a second! It's not anyone's fault. [everyone turns to the root of the sound. A spirit enters the court] I am sick an tired of all this nonsense over my porcelain toilet machine.
P. Sanchez
There he is, Sir John Harrington.
Mr. Garrison
Quick, sue him!
Sir Harrington
You can't sue me. [approaches to the toilet cabinet located in the court] You're all using my toilet invention the wrong way. [camera pans to the TSA agents who look at each other] When you have to sit and take a Sir Harrington you're supposed to be facing this way. [sits on it backwards, just like the way Butters did] So you can use the little shelf for your books, and your quill and your ink.
Butters
A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
Sir Harrington
Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look right down at your Harrington to flush. That's gross.
Randy
Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
Sir Harrington
Of course! Why do you think I designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole? [points to the hole in the cabin]
Randy
That's what that hole is for? Oh. [the people in the room join] Oops.
The Cartman house, night. Cartman is lying on the bed in his pajamas while cutting his toenails, just like the beginning of the episode. He is talking on the phone.
Cartman
So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like "Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!" And Clyde is all like "Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!" Dude, it was a riot.
Clyde is reading a comic book on a shelf while holding the receiver on his ear.
Clyde
That's not what I said.
Cartman
Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
Clyde is sitting on the toilet... backwards, and peeing.
Cartman
[his voice comes through the receiver] Clyde, you there? Hello? [Clyde comes off the toilet, flushing it. He waits for a few seconds, then angrily puts the seat up, and leaves the bathroom while flipping off his mother pointing upwards.]
End of Reverse Cowgirl

Cash For Gold
Looming Sunset Assisted Living center, day. We can surmise from this that Grandpa Marsh was put in this home when Sharon and Randy divorced shortly after Stan's 10th birthday. The family stops by for a visit.
Randy
Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
Sharon
What?! Randy!
Randy
[shushes her] Just trying to leave without being rude.
Marvin
[rolls over to a small table next to the TV. There's a gift-wrapped box on it] Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson. [gets the box and wheels back to the family] Come here, Billy. [meets Stan in the middle of the room] You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy [Stan smiles and glances back at his parents], to impress all the ladies [Stan takes the gift from him, then looks back at his parents].
Sharon
Go ahead and open it, Stan. [Stan opens the gift as Shelly and his parents surround him. Sharon kneels behind him and looks over his shoulder] Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? [she puts it on him - gold base, turquoise center, diamonds surrounding it (12 small, 24 tiny)]
Marvin
That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.
Randy
[approaches Marvin] Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
Marvin
Six thousand dollars.
Randy
Six thousand?!
Marvin
It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.
Randy
Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's our money!
Sharon
It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!
Marvin
Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?
The bus stop, next day. It's picture day! Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny are waiting at the bus stop. Stan approaches, wearing the bolo tie, and stands next to the other boys. Cartman studies him at length
Cartman
Nice bolo tie, Stan.
Stan
[looks away to avoid eye contact] Thanks. [Kyle takes notice]
Cartman
Bolo ties are... [quickly glances at Kyle] really in right now. Cool you have one.
Stan
[annoyed] Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
Cartman
No, dude, it's... badass.
Stan
[angered] It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
Kyle
That... was six grand?
Stan
Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
Cartman
...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
Stan
[finally breaks, facepalming] I know! [lowers his right arm] I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
Kyle
Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says "Cash For Gold and Jewelry." There must be a lot of people doin' it.
Downtown South Park, the jewelry district, day. Outside a Cash For Gold store a man spins a sign around with his hands. Inside, behind a bullet-proof partition, a clerk looks the bolo over with a jeweler's scope
Clerk 1
You didn't steal this, did you?
Stan
No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
Clerk 1
[does some calculations on his computer] It's 14-karat gold, diamond and turquoise. I'll give you fifteen dollars.
Stan
...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
Clerk 1
Yeah, I can't really make anything on the diamonds. I'd have to send it to a smelter, have it all smelted down for the gold, probably could make a ten-dollar profit.
Stan
Fifteen bucks?!
Kyle
Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
Stan
Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! [takes back the bolo tie]
Cartman
You may suck our collective balls, sir! [they leave the store, turn right and walk]
Kyle
Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
Stan
Yeah! Here's one. [turns into the next store past the empty lot. The man outside is wearing a signboard]
Inside the second store, a fat blonde woman looks the bolo tie over
Clerk 2
These are real diamonds, right?
Stan
Yeah dude, you can test them.
Clerk 2
Okay. Eight dollars.
Stan
[stunned, then angry] This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
Clerk 2
[looks it over again] Nine dollars.
Taco Bell, day. No go at the second store, so the boys come here. Outside, a man twirls a sign around which also points to Taco Bell as a cash for gold and jewelry store. The boys go in and get the bolo tie appraised
Clerk 3
Welcome to Taco Bell. Would you like to try our Doritos Locos Tacos?
Stan
I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. [hands the bolo to the clerk. The clerk looks it over, brings out his own pocket scope, and looks it over more closely]
Clerk 3
Fourteen-karat gold gets yaaa $14 a gram on the open market, got about... 4 grams here... [puts his scope away] It's not really worth my time. I guess I can give you a six-layer burrito for it.
Stan
A six-layer burrito?
Kyle
You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
Clerk 3
Alright, a seven-layer burrito! But that's as high as I'm going!
Outside Taco Bell, sitting on a curb
Stan
Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
J&G Shopping Network, Jewelry Bonanza with DEAN, Channel 233. The show is already in progress. Dean, dressed in a white Western shirt, shows off his wares
Dean
Okay, folks, we are com-, half-way complete with today's broadcast. [scratches his nose] You wanna get in on these deals, call now. Next item is... This is item number 4 5 7 8 1 1 1. [switch to a close-up] Look at these stunning earrings. These are genuine faux sapphire earrings. Fourteen karat gold, 86 carat faux sapphire. Faux is a French word. Got an x in it, but you don't need to pronounce the x. How do you like that for prestigious? These earrings normally go for $6,000,000. We're gonna sell these today fer... [purses his lips together and exhales through them] $320!That's a steal. Now th-oh, there go the phones, they're lightin' up. I believe we have a sale? Do we have a sale? Yea- let's get her on the line. Hello? Who am I speakin' with?
Vivian
Hello... my name is... Vivian.
Dean
Vivian, you just got a heck of a deal. What's your last name, sweetheart?
Vivian
Oh I... I can't remember.
Dean
You can't remember. Well can you remember your credit card number?
Vivian
3 7 1 5-
Dean
Hold on, Vivivan, we'll get you on with a rep, take down that number. Thanks for shoppin' with us and congratulations on the lovely 14 karat gold sapphire earrings. At that price you practically stole them from us. Ouch. Okay-
Cartman's house, day. The boys are looking at Jewelry Bonanza in the living room and have just seen an old woman get swindled out of her money
Kyle
Dude, that's terrible!
Cartman
I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
Stan
But, how do they get away with that?
Cartman
This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. [walks out]
Stan
What are you talking about?
Cartman
[standing next to a covered mobile whiteboard] For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. [unveils the equation]
Kyle
That's the chemical equation for gold?
Cartman
Dialog
Kyle
...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
Kenny
(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
Cartman
Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
Dean
Oh my gosh, can you believe this? Somebody's about to get this $20,000 topaz and copper ring for just four thousand bucks. [a close-up of the ring] We've got our buyer on the line. You buyin' this as a gift, sir?
Caller
No, I'm buying it as a gift! For my grandson Billy!
Stan
Grandpa? [gets off the sofa and runs out the front door]
Looming Sunset Assisted Living, night. Marvin is watching Jewely Bonanza. Onscreen is a necklace with a large emerald on it
Dean
How about that, folks? That is Brazilian emerald, finest emerald available. We're letting this oen go fer... fourteen ninety five [$1495.00 onscreen], EZ Pay. We call it that to save you time. EZ is an abbreviation of easy. Fourteen ninety five, EZ Pay an... What's that? Okay, alright, I just got word, we are droppin' the Z from EZ Pay. It's now just E Pay. [onscreen EZ Pay is erased, then E Pay appears] By usin' the word E Pay instead of takin' all that time to say EZ Pay, we're savin' you a second of time, and those seconds add up. Go ahead and try it: say E Pay five thousand times. That's five thousand seconds, nine hours... we just saved you here on J&G Shoppin' Network. [Grandpa's eyes begin to wander] Not wastin' your time here, you can't afford not to buy this one. You don't have a lot of time left. Literally. Pass this one down to your kids, your grandkids. [Stan appears at the doorway] Show 'em your life had meaning.
Stan
Grandpa.
Marvin
[turns his head to the left to look at Stan] Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? [smiles]
Stan
She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.
Marvin
Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.
Stan
She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.
Marvin
Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy... [faces the TV again, visibly shaken] Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?
Stan
Yes, Grandpa.
Marvin
[reminiscing with a smile] I loved that dog. She always made me so happy. When she died, I... I didn't let myself get too sad, 'cause I thought, thought I'd always have the memory of her slobberin' happy face. [the smile disappears] I can't remember what she looked like, Billy... Huh. Huohh. [gets a headache and rests his head on his left hand]
Stan
Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! [turns to his left and leaves with determination. Marvin is left looking distressed]
South Park Elementary, playground, day. During recess, Butters twirls a sign around, while Cartman is decked out in all sorts of jewelry.
Cartman
Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
Butters
[loses control of the sign] Whoops! [it lands face up on the snow]
Cartman
[quickly analyzing the situation] Butters, what the fuck?!
Butters
[winces, then massages his right arm] Sorry. My arms hurt.
Cartman
"My arms hurt." Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! [Butters picks the sign up and resumes twirling]
Leroy
Hey! How much will you give me for this? [shows him a ring with a huge rock on it]
Cartman
Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
Leroy
Okay. [gives the ring to Cartman, who transfers it to his left hand. Cartman reaches into his back pocket and give Leroy the three dollars. Leroy turns and walks away]
Cartman
We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
Jewelry Bonanza.
Dean
And that's it, we just sold this bracelet to Ms. Marcia Tubbs. Martha, thank you so much for your call. You just got yourself a heck of a deal on this one. You there Marcia?
Marcia
[over the phone] Yes. [a car honks at her] I'm lost. I'm lost walkin' on the freeway.
Dean
Alright, you're lost walkin' on the freeway? Enjoy the Tiger's Eye Aquamarine bracelet. Alri- okay, what should we do next? Oh I see one. Here's a good'un. Lemme... [picks out a ring with a large yellow stone in the middle] Lemme... lemme set the stage for you here: you're goin' to that seniors' cocktail party? It's bingo night and you're lookin' for somethin' to wear? How about a 13 carat panzoto-panzanite ring. This is-oh! We got a caller already on this one! Hello sir, you must be a fan of panzoto-panzanite.
Stan
Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?
Dean
...What's that?
Stan
I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
Dean
Okay, we're gonna sell this ring for just thirty-seven ninety five. [$3,795.00 onscreen] How's that? [puts the ring onto a woman's right ring finger.]
Stan
I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
Dean
Alright, well you shouldn't say things like that 'cause... some host of a jewelry channel sure might up and do it, and then you'd feel really bad.
Stan
No i wouldn't.
Dean
Yes you would.
Stan
No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
Dean
Alright, well how about this?! If a jewelry network host goes home tonight and blows the brains out, you might be liable. That's a lawsuit worth ...2.7 million dollars? How's that sound?
Stan
I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
Dean
[long silence as the jewelry carousel goes around] Alright, I tell you what: I'll bring the lawsuit down to twenty-nine thirty-nine- [the $6,000,000 is erased and replaced by $2,939.00]
Stan
Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
Dean
[another long silence, then he clears his throat] Well, you think it's funny, but that's, that's callin' up and tellin' someone to kill themselves; that's not a joke.
Stan
I'm not joking. [pause] Do it.
Eric Jewelry Cavalcade, with Eric. Now on the Old People's Shopping Network, founded by Eric Cartman. He's in his basement, behind a table with his own props and jewelry
Cartman
Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5 [actually 55-26177] This is-oh my God, look at this you guys. [shows off the ring Leroy sold him earlier] This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
Caller
Hello?
Cartman
YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
Mrs. Appleby
This is Mrs. Appleby on 24 Palmark Lane?
Cartman
Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
Mrs. Appleby
[long pause] I'm sorry?
Cartman
Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
Mrs. Appleby
Thank you.
Cartman
Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought "Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"
Mrs. Appleby
...I thought it'd be a lovely gift for my granddaughter Jessica. She's captain of the debate team at Jefferson High School. see-
Cartman
Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
Mrs. Appleby
Goodbye.
Cartman
Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
A smelting plant. Shown is the Oscar for Best Actor: Sean Penn in Milk. The camera pulls back to reveal a pile of gold jewelry on which the Oscar sits. A shovel comes in and scoops it up with some other jewelry. The worker holding the shovel moves it to a vat of molten gold and dumps the jewelry into the vat. Escaping air makes a fart sound as the jewelry sinks into liquid gold, and then some bubbles popping follow
Stan
Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
Manager
Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.
Stan
Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: "Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"
Kyle
Yeah!
Kenny
(Fuck yeah!)
Manager
We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually "Mayii nahii chahatapahnii"
Kyle
What does that mean?
Manager
"Whoever denied it, [lowers his voice] supplied it." [the boys are stunned]
The neighborhood park, day. Stan is now on a crusade to stop this madness, but he hasn't found the right target. Kyle has his arms crossed
Stan
YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
Butters
[looks around at his fellow sign twirlers] We aren't makin' that much, fellas.
Stan
You're not?
Twirler 1
Who don't you yell at the people who melt the gold down? The old Hindu saying is "Whever smelt it dealt it" [other twirlers agree with him: "Yeah!" "That's right!"]
Kyle
[leans forward] Nuh uh! It's "Whoever denied it, supplied it!"
Twirler 2
You got it all wrong. The jewelry that those shopping networks sell don't even come from us! It's all made in India, where those Hindu rhymes come from!
Twirler 3
What are you saying, Gustav? My God, do you mean?
Twirler 4
That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.
Gems Wholesale, day. Cartman walks by with a briefcase
Cartman
Suck my balls, suck my balls... [enters the store] Hello!
Clerk 4
[An Asian woman] Ohhhh welcoooome! Welcome to discount jewelry stohhhhh! [her two assistants join her as Cartman takes a seat at the counter]
Cartman

Cartman

Cartman
Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
Clerk 4
Nono, you fucked me!
Cartman
Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
India Manufacturing, Inc., a rainy day somewhere in India. A taxi pulls up to the plant, with Cartman and Butters inside. Butters opens his door and hops out, then opens Cartman's door. Cartman looks around and clears his throat to get Butters' attention.
Butters
Oh sorry, sorry. [looks back at his seat and pulls out the sign. then points it at Cartman. Cartman then hops out and proceeds to the plant, with Butters following]
Inside the plant. All the workers here are children working in cubicles, assembling new jewelry. A supervisor walks by collecting newly finished jewelry in a metal box. The receptionist shows Cartman and Butters in while one boy is sealing packages in another room
Cartman
[to the receptionist] You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that- [a disturbing sight stops him in his tracks] Motherfucker!
Stan
[railing at an older Indian boy] You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! [Kenny and Kyle are with him]
Cartman
[approaches the other boys] You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
Butters
Sorry! [catches up to him]
Cartman
-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
Kyle
We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
Cartman
No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
Stan
Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa! [the boy reaches for a necklace and offers it to Stan] No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! [the boy thinks about what to do with the necklace, then reaches for a small plastic pouch and puts it in. The boy motions to another boy]
Kyle
What's he doing?
Montage. The boy tosses the necklace into a box being carried by another supervisor, then motions to someone else as the supervisor carries the box away. Outside, several workers load up a truck. The supervisor gives his box to one of the loaders. A planeload of jewelry leaves India and arrives at Atlanta. The box is then shipped by QDC to J&G headquarters. A J&G worker carries a gold ruby necklace to Dean at his Jewelry Bonanza set. He then puts the necklace on camera and sells it to an elderly woman who still lives at home. A FedExX truck arrives at her house and the driver delivers it to her personally. He tips his hat to her as he leaves. She opens the package right then and there, at her front door, and pulls out the necklace. She gives it to her daughter, who is quite happy to get it. The daughter goes to a Cash For Gold store and sells it to the clerk. He puts it into a box containing other jewelry, puts in more jewelry to fill the box up, then delivers it to an Industrial Smelting and Refining plant. He sells it to one of the workers there. The worker brings it into a room and splits the jewelry among his associates. They sort the gems by type as they dismantle the jewelry. The gold is sent to be melted down and made into gold bars. The gold and jewels are sent separately back to India, where an IPS truck goes to India Manufacturing to deliver the raw materials. The workers deliver the materials to the supervisors, who take them inside and distribute them among the child workers. The child workers assemble the raw materials into new jewelry, and the cycle starts again. Back in Atlanta, more packages are delivered to J&G headquarters by E-Z Delivery. A J&G worker delivers a gold amethyst necklace to Dean, who sells it to an elderly couple. An ADL truck arrives and the driver delivers it to the couple. The husband receives it and opensn it. The driver tips his hat and leaves. The couple then offer the necklace to their daughter, who's overjoyed to get it. She and her husband take the necklace to a different cash for gold store and sell it to the clerk there. The necklace is dismantled into its various parts and the gold melted down again. IPS delivers the raw materials back to India Manufacturing. A supervisor dumps some gems onto the desk of a different child worker, who is working on a picture frame. He finishes the frame and walks up to the older boy. The older boy takes the picture frame to Stan and gives it to him.
Stan
Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
The park surrounding Looming Sunset, day. Stan is visiting Marvin, who's well enough to sit on the bench with him with the use of a cane
Stan
So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
Marvin
Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.
Stan
Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. [hands him the gift]
Marvin
Oh, for me? [takes the gift and unwraps it] Oh! My God. There she is. [a picture of Grandpa in younger days with his dog] Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot. [they smile at each other for a moment] Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?
Stan
Yeah.
Marvin
I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.
Stan
Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.
Marvin
That's a good idea. [looks back at the picture and smiles. Stan looks down and away]
Jewelry Bonanza with Dean. Onscreen is a pair of earrings selling for $2800.00
Dean
Folks, these are not your ordinary peridot craponite earrings, these are 18-karat gold! and we got-oh, do we have a buyer on the line? Hello?
Caller 1
[long pause] What are you waiting for? Kill yourself.
Dean
Alright Goddamnit, we got another comedian. Ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell me I should kill myself.
Caller 1
He was right. Do it.
Dean
Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us... two dollars and thirty six cents! So now, how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry ? Yes. Hello, sir?
Caller 2
You're too scared to do it, aren't-cha? You don't have the balls.
Dean
Goddamnit I'm not scared to do it.
Caller 2
New, you're scared. You got, you got lady balls. [hangs up. The dial tone is heard and Dean moves on to the next call]
Caller 3
Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings?
Dean
Yes ma'am!
Caller 3
They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself?
Dean
Alright, that's that! That there's the- the straw that broke the camel's back! I got a gun right here; whattaya think about that?!
Caller 3
Put it against your temple and pull the trigger. [long pause. The gun is cocked and then goes off. A thump is heard and blood lands all over the set. The soothing music plays on]
End of Cash For Gold

Faith Hilling
CNN Conference Room. Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul are standing behind their benches, debating. A loud applause is heard.
Mitt
I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way.
Rick
I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.
New
What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama.
Ron
We faced something much much greater after World War II. [the camera pans to Stan, who is in the audience] We had ten million coming home at once. What did we do then? Some liberals said we need more work programs-
Stan
Tango, Tango, I'm in position.
Kyle
[offscreen] Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?
Stan
It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
Kyle
Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
Butters
[going through a hallway with a trolley] Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.
Kyle
Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
Cartman
[in a wooden dark place with two wires on the ground] I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
The conference room is shown again. The audience applauds as Stan looks around. The Secret Service agents are shown.
Agent 1
We might have a problem.
Agent 2
What's that?
Agent 1
We just got word somebody might try to Faith Hill this event.
Agent 2
Lock down the whole perimeter. Nobody is Faith Hilling, not on my watch! [raises his fists and walks away. The stage is shown through Stan's angle. Three other agents step on the stage.]
Stan
I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this. [Butters takes a plate from the trolley, which has an iPhone on it, and walks to the left. Meanwhile Kenny comes from the opposite direction, taking the iPhone and passing it to Stan.] I got it.
Agent 3
Hey, somebody is under the stage.
Kyle
Go Cartman! [Cartman runs up and comes on the stage. He cheerfully pulls his shirt out near the nipple area. Stan takes a picture. Four agents come up to chase Cartman.]
Outside the conference room. Butters, Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman run out.
Butter
We got it. We got it!
Stan
Go, go, go.
Cartman
Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. [The agents run after them.]
The news
Reporter
First, there was planking. [various images of people planking come up] People taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the Internet. Planking was soon replaced by owling. [a picture of a boy with his knees drawn to his chest] And after the Super Bowl by Bradying. [New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as well as an overweight man, both sitting on the ground with their legs straight out, hands clasped and looking down] But the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs. [Cartman pulling out his shirt at the debate is shown, this time fullscreen] It's called Faith Hilling. And all around the world people are doing it. [A black boy pulling his red shirt, then a ginger boy with a cap doing the exact same thing with his grey-and-white sweatshirt] Kids, adults, and even notable celebrities are getting into the act. [L.A. Lakers player Kobe Bryant is shown pulling on his jersey. The news studio comes to view again.] But as Faith Hilling is more and more popular, the question on everyone's mind, who will be the first to die doing it?
South Park Elementary, day. The boys, along with the rest of the forth graders, are in a wooden room, being lectured by Professor Lamont.
Lamont
I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire! [the children are listening to him, Cartman has a bored look] Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of Bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.
Cartman
Oh, please. Bradying is so 2000 and late.
Lamont
[lowers the projector screen] I know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool. But the truth is memeing has been around a long time. We're gonna watch a film strip now, that's a little dated but I think it gets the point across. [turns the projector on to start the film]
Warbly muzak is heard, as the film, 'BLOODY SUNDAY: The Dangers of MEMEING', begins. A man with an old style hair is sitting in a classroom with a outdated TV and a poster for the computer club which has a picture of an old computer.
Speaker
For many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time. The latest meme has also become the most deadly. It's called Tebowing [The caption TEBOWING appears in the middle of the screen].
Residential area. Two boys are walking towards a grassy area leading to the railroad tracks. One of the boys has an iPhone in his hands.
Speaker
[offscreen] This is Ryan and Barkley. They're about to learn how dangerous Tebowing can be.
Ryan
Here is a good place. I'll do it right here.
Barkley
I don't know, Ryan. You sure this is a good idea? [Ryan walks onto a railway]
Ryan
Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second. How could I get hurt? [kneels down and puts his right elbow on his right knee, closing his eyes as well as pinching his nose bridge]
Barkley
Okay, hold still. [puts up his iPhone. A train horn is heard.] What's that?
Ryan
A traaain! AAAAAA! [Barkley and Ryan continue to scream and look around while staying in the same position. The train is still off in the distance.]
Barkley
RYAN!
Ryan
No, no! Nooo!
Barkley
AAAA!!!
Ryan
AAAA!!!No, no, no, no, noooo!
Barkley
AAAA!!![The train finally comes at full force and hits Ryan, severing him in half and covering Barkley in blood.]
South Park Elementary. Butters covers his face after seeing what just happened while the rest of the class is unfazed.
Butters
AAAA!!!
Residential area. Barkley, covered in blood, stands at the railroad tracks and looks down in horror at Ryan's severed body
Barkley
RYAN!
Ryan
Learn from me.[dies]
Secluded area, nighttime. A young couple is sitting in a parked car.
Woman 1
This sure is a nice car, Tommy. [raises her iPhone] Would you like to get a picture of me Tebowing in it?
Tommy
Sure. [gets the iPhone to take her picture. As the woman poses, the train's headlight appears in the distance and its horn is heard.] What is that?
Woman 1
Oh my God! It's coming!
Tommy
God, no! [he exits the car while she continues Tebowing inside, revealing that they parked on the railroad track] Aahh! No, no!
Woman 1
[scared] Tommy, d-did you get the picture?
Tommy
Oh no, wait! Hold on! [hurriedly presses on the iPhone, then gets ready to take the picture]
Woman 1
Hurry, hurry!
Tommy
AAAAA! [attempts to take the picture as the train comes closer]
Woman 1
AAAAA! [The train finally comes at full force and crushes the car as Tommy runs off. Her bloody, severed head then lands onto a dirt field next to the track and her mouth opens, letting out an audible scream] Aaah!
South Park Elementary. Butters screams out in horror again while the rest of the class is still unfazed.
Butters
AAAA!!!
A man wearing a yellow and red-stripped jacket and round sunglasses is looking upward and talking to his friend while holding an iPhone.
Man 1
Be careful up there, Pete.
Pete
[Tebowing on top of a wall with graffiti in a residential area] Just go on and take the picture. [the wall is suddenly destroyed by a train, killing Pete and knocking his friend down, before he quickly gets up and looks on in horror.]
South Park Elementary. Butters screams out and covers his face again. Cartman now looks bored, while the rest of the class is still unfazed.
Butters
AAAA!!!
The speaker in the old-fashioned classroom is shown.
Speaker
These youths paid with their lives for Tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs [puts his index and middle fingers up], bunny ears [raises his arm while keeping the previous gesture] and fake wiener [turns his body sideways, bends his left arm and leg] Maybe you think this doesn't apply to you. Maybe you think your memes are safe. Or maybe you're watching this in the future and Tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. Well, if you are watching his in the future, [a blue screen comes to view while the following words of the speaker gets typed] get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember--
A photo of three teenagers from the 1980s standing outside under a tree is shown while the following lines are sung
Singers
Use the approved poses if you want to be a memer. 
Peace signs! 
[A male teenager with a sweater and mustache puts his right middle and index fingers up in a V-shape]
Bunny ears! 
[A female teenager smiles while putting her middle and index fingers in a V-shape behind the head of the previous male teenager]
Fake wiener! 
[A male teenager wearing a neon colored windbreaker turns his body sideways and bends his left arm and leg]

South Park Elementary. The fourth graders come out, almost all having concerned looks on their faces. Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman and Butters walk together.
Cartman
[yawns] Oh, God. That was boring.
Kenny
(Totally!)
Kyle
So, what do you want to do now?
Cartman
Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
Stan
Oh, that's a good idea.
Butters
What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
Cartman
Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
Butters
Well, count me out.
Kyle
You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
Butters
Well, I'm scared. [Craig shows up]
Craig
Hey, did you see today's newspaper?
Cartman
Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
Craig
You guys made the front page.
Cartman
Really? [the boys excitedly run, except for Butters]
The boys run in a liquor store.
Stan
Dude, we are on the front page!
Cartman
Yes!
Kenny
(Yeah, dude!)
Stan
Can we get a different pose, please? [hands the clerk two dollars and gets the paper]
Cartman
What's it say, what's it say?
Stan
It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
Cartman
What? Let me see that. [the newspaper has Cartman's pictured and a headline 'Faith Hilling so 2,000 late']
Kyle
How can that be? Already?
Stan
[reads the newspaper] Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
Kyle
How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
Stan
[continues reading] "Faith Hilling is pretty stale," said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive."
Cartman
Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
Cartman's computer screen. Various people sitting on their bare butts with their hands down between their legs are shown. Cartman is in front of the computer, with Stan and Kyle on his both sides and Kenny behind him.
Stan
That's all it is? [Kenny moves to the left-hand side]
Cartman
You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. [shows three other guys' pictures]
Kyle
But that's stupid. [Kenny moves to the right-hand side] How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
Cartman
I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage. [shows a couple of more pictures] This has to be stopped, you guys.
Outside Café Monet, day. A boy is Taylor Swifting in front of the café. Two girls and a boy watch him as the boy pictures him with his iPhone.
Boy 1
[giggles] Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. [the iPhone screen is shown as Cartman photobombs while Faith Hilling.]
Cartman
How is this Kyle? This good? [the boy moves away a bit. The other kids are stunned. The boys stand next to them, Kyle having an iPhone in his hands]
Kyle
Yep, that's great. [glances at the other kids]
Cartman
[continues moving as the other boy tries to get past him] Cool, these will be good uploads.
Boy 2
Hey, what are you doing?
Cartman
Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
Boy 1
Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
Stan
Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
Boy 2
[starts to crawl away] Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else. [Cartman continues to cover his view] [to Cartman] Knock it off!
Cartman
Why don't you make me? [the boy punches him, Cartman responds by hitting him on the ground. Stan and Kyle begin to punch Boy 1 while Kenny attacks the girls.]
South Park Elementary, day. The boys are in the wooden classroom again. Professor Lamont brings in a box, then pulls a gun out of it. He loads it with a bullet while the fourth graders bewilderingly watch him.
Lamont
Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe. [the boys glance at each other] Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed! [puts the gun on Butters' desk] That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up.
Butters
Oh, that's okay. I think...
Lamont
Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and Hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?
Kids
Yes, sir.
Lamont
Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
Butters
HA?!
Lamont
Hey! You're following plankers and Tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT! [Butters hesitantly puts the gun in his mouth] Everybody take a good look. [points to Butters] This is what you're doing every time you play with Internet memes. YOU ARE PLAYING ROULETTE WITH YOUR FUCKING LIVE! [A hawk is heard offscreen. Two men enter the classroom.]
Man 2
Professor Lamont, we need to talk.
Lamont
I will be right back. [leaves the classroom]
The gym. The two men are seated at a table, pulling out files out of their briefcases.
Man 2
You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont.
Lamont
Yes, what is this about? [puts his bag on the table]
Man 3
We need your expertise, sir.
Man 2
Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?
Lamont
Another species? What are you talking about?
Man 3
We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand... [types on his laptop] this. [turns around the laptop. Professor Lamont puts on his reading glasses to look at the screen, which shows various cats with breads around their heads.] Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us.
Lamont
They're evolving. Cats are evolving. [moves the cursor down to see more pictures]
Man 3
Sorry?
Lamont
There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt.
Man 2
We're having a hard time following you here.
Lamont
[opens a book] Look. In the 70s there was fonzing. [the book page has two people's pictures with their thumbs up] Which replaced the outdated mustaching. [a guy with his index finger above his lips] In the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting. [people raising their fists up to the sky] But even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s. [the Nazis doing their trademark salute] Even before photographs humans memed for portraits. All the way back to the Egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking. [an Ancient Egypt painting]
Man 2
You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?
Lamont
[walks to the front] If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures, [takes his glasses off] they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are. [dramatic music plays]
The wooden classroom. The only person left there is Butters, who still has the gun in his mouth. He looks around for a moment, then looks down to the gun again.
The Cartman house, day. Mr. Kitty is sleeping over her cat tree. The boys come in, Cartman has a laptop in his hands, which shows a picture of Mr. Kitty cat breading.
Cartman
Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this? [Mr. Kitty looks at him] You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty. [closes his laptop and approaches Mr. Kitty] Bad Mr. Kitty. [Cartman hits Mr. Kitty with a stick. Mr. Kitty hisses, then paws at him.] Bad kitty! No more memeing! [walks away] Come on, guys. [the boys walk out of the room. Cartman turns his back to scold his cat again] Bad Mr. Kitty!
The boys come out of Cartman's house.
Stan
Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
Kyle
Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
Cartman
I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
Stan
That's a cool idea
Kenny
[sighs] (Oh, fuck it, dude.) [walks away]
Kyle
W-what's the matter, Kenny?
Kenny
(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
Stan
What seems pointless?
Kenny
(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
Kyle
Hey! [the boys approach Kenny] Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
Kenny
(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
Stan
No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
Cartman
Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
Breaking News.
Reporter
Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say "Oh Long Johnson" on video before getting out of the way.

Boy 3
You ready, you ready?
Boy 4
[offscreen] I'm recording, go.
Boy 3
[the machine throws balls. The boy stands in front of them] Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. O-Oh Long- [gets hit by a ball]
Boy 4
Larry!
Reporter
This latest Internet meme is shocking. But most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all, but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety.
A video of a black cat moaning.
Cat
Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
Reporter
The cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death.
Café Monet, day. Stan crawls in, Taylor Swifting.
Stan
Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
Boy 1
[his fellows are standing besides him. He has an iPhone in his hands] Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way.
Stan
[continues to crawl around] Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- [he is confronted by Stan, Kyle and Kenny]
Cartman
Dude, what's going on?
Stan
Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? [hurriedly puts his pants on]
Kyle
We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
Boy 1
He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff.
Stan
Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
Cartman
Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
Kyle
Benedict Arnold. [the three boys walk away]
Stan
Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay? [the boys stop] You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. [Kenny looks down]
Kyle
Kenny?
Kenny
[approaches Stan and the other boys] (I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
Boy 1
If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. [he and his friends walk away]
Sta
You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. [Kenny pulls down his pants and starts crawling on his butt.]
Kyle
You guys are sellouts.
Cartman
[holds him] Come on, Kyle.
Kyl
You're freaking sellouts!
Cartman
It's okay, man, come on.
An interrogation room. The two men from the gym stand behind Professor Lamont.
Lamont
What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire? [the black cat is kept in a cage]
Cat
Oh Long Johnson.
Lamont
Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?
Cat
Oh Long Jeeea-
Lamont
You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!
Cat
Oh oh oh.
A news reporter speaking.
Reporter 2
Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival. [walks to a railway] A brand new meme, where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing. They call it "reporting". And safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal. [train horn] Oh! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. [gets hit by the train]
The wooden classroom, night. Butters is still sitting there with gun in his mouth, but now he's quite drowsy and barely keeps himself awake.
Cartman is Faith Hilling in front of a Planned Parenthood Clinic.
Kyle
[has an iPhone in his hands] Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more. [Cartman raises his left hand a bit] Yeah, yeah freeze there. [a man comes into view with his little son]
Little Boy
What are those boys doing, daddy?
Dad
Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.
Little Boy
How droll. [The man and boy leave the scene. Cartman and Kyle look down for a moment]
Cartman
Get a couple facing the other way, brah. [turns the other way]
Kyle
Yeah, good idea. [a doctor comes out of the clinic]
Doctor
Hey, you kids Faith Hilling in front of my clinic? 'Cause I got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine. [giggles] Get it? [goes back to his clinic. A man with a car sounds his horn]
Man 4
Go back to the 90s! Faggooots!
Kyle
[approaches Cartman] We have to face it, Cartman.
Cartman
I know. I know Kyle. [stops lifting his "nipples" up]
Kyle
I really thought it was gonna last.
Cartman
I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change. [starts crying] The sun hurts my eyes. [wipes away his tears]
Kyle
It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
Cartman
No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
Kyle
I-It's good that it became something else.
Cartman
And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. [both of them sigh]

Household cats have evolved into a species as intelligent as humans. Will this mean war between our two life forms? In an attempt to try and communicate with the leader of cats, experts have sent in the ambassador of people.
The interrogation room.

Hello.

Oh Long Johnson.

Oh Lala Lionde. Oh Long John- Don Piano. Don Piaaaano.
The ambassador comes out of the room. The two men and Professor Lamont is waiting him outside.
Cat
Oh Long Johnson. [the ambassador closes the door]
Ambassador
I'm not sure but I think it said war between our species is inevitable, that evolution cannot be stopped and cats will rise. It said we cannot coexist and then said oh don piaaano and then and then something about seeing the streets of human cities running red with the blood of their children.
An iPhone screen, camera app on. Cartman pulls up Mr. Kitty, who now has a bread around his head.
Stan
[has the iPhone in his hands, while Kyle and Kenny stand next to him] Okay, that's good, a little higher.
Cartman
[he is doing a combination of Taylor Swifting and Cat Breading] Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
Kyle
Yeah, that's awesome.
Stan
OK, whenever you're ready.
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
Mr. Kitty
Meow.

No kitty! That's a bad kitty! [Boy 1 and his friends come over]

Wow, what's this?
Kyle
What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
Stan
Alright, go Cartman.

Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.

SHUT UP, KITTY!
The conference room. A reporter is giving his speech.
Reporter 3
With the inevitable species war looming, our country's brightest leaders have come together to debate and reason with the ambassador of cats. It's called putty-whistling. And the question on everyone's mind... Who will be the first person to die from it? [Rick, Mitt, Newt and the cat are standing behind their lecterns.]
Mitt
W-well, you know, I ran for president four years ago. This was the position I described when I ran four years ago...
Rick
If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-
Newt
To ask a very simple question. How big of a scale of change do we want in Washington.
Cat
Oh Long Johnson.
Newt
I started working in the governor wing in 1974.
Cat
[Rick and Newt talk] Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Piaano.
Newt
I'm gonna say two things...
Cat
Oh Long Johnson.
Mitt
I have five sons, five daughters in law, sixteen grand kids, and they're the joy of my life.
Cat
Oh Lalalonde.
Newt
I was wrong when I figured it out. You were wrong when you didn't.
Cat
Oh Long Johnson.
Rick
It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong-
Stan
[the debate goes on. The camera pans to Stan, again in the audience] Fox trot standing by at position alpha.
Kyle
Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
Kenny is in the bathroom. He pulls out Mr. Kitty from the toilet tank.
Kenny
(This is Tango. I have the goods.)
Stan
Standing by in three seconds.
Cartman is waiting behind a purple curtain.
Kyle
Two, one. Go Cartman!
Cartman
Let's do this. [he runs to the hallway, where Kenny hands him Mr. Kitty. He goes to the stage with Mr. Kitty, and pulls down his pants as Stan is ready to record him. He then stops, thinking.]
Kyle
Cartman? Go, Cartman.
Stan
Come on, dude. Hurry.
Cartman
[softly] No. NOO! [puts his pants back on] I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this. [puts down Mr. Kitty] And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. [he turns sideways and snaps his fingers a few times, then pulls up his shirt, Faith Hilling.]
Kyle
[observing him though a computer] Yeah. Do it, Cartman.
Cartman
[music begins to play]
Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.

Stan
Wow!
Cartman
We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.

Man 5
Have you ever seen Faith Hilling so good?
Cartman
Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
[the audience and Rick, Mitt and Newt join him]
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.

Cat
Oh Long Johnson.
Cartman
Is a meme I will fight
[Stan is joined by Kyle and Kenny in the audience. Butters is in the wooden classroom dancing to the song, yet still has the gun in his mouth]
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.

Reporter 3
And so in the face of war a little boy reminds us all what being human really means. The message is unclear. But it doesn't matter as long as you give the audience a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with boobies. It's called pandering and all over the country people are- [train horn] Oh! Oh Long Johns- [gets hit by the train]
End of Faith Hilling

Jewpacabra
The Broflovski house, morning. Kyle, who has just woken up, comes out of his room yawning. He walks to the kitchen and begins to prepare cereal for himself.
Sheila
[talking to someone] Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner. [Kyle takes his bowl and heads to the dining table] Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.[he walks past the living room, where Cartman and Sheila are shown talking]
Cartman
Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
Sheila
Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
Cartman
Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? [Kyle stops and starts listening]
Sheila
Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. [Kyle rushes to the entrance]
Cartman
So interesting, wow. [he and Sheila are drinking tea]
Kyle
[to Cartman, angrily] Get out of here.
Cartman
Oh, hey, Kyle.
Kyle
Get. Outta here! [points his finger to the left]
Cartman
Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
Sheila
Well, you're very welcome.
Kyle
[walks to him] What are you gonna do?
Cartman
Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
Kyle
No?
Cartman
Alright, Kyle, listen. [comes forward with Kyle, then sighs] Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
Kyle
What does that have to do with Passover?
Cartman
All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever. [Cartman announces the special within the episode] "Cartman's Passover Holiday Special", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! [creepy music plays]
A large green park in a sunny day. People are decorating the park for Easter while children are on the line for Kids' Egg Hunt Signup
Attendant
Alright, next please. Signing up for the Easter egg hunt? [Stan is in the front of the line]
Butters
[at the middle of the line] Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
Craig
Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday.
Kenny
(Me, too.)
Cartman
[anxious] Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
Craig
Jewpa what?
Cartman
Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
Craig
Okay. [to Token and Kenny] So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?
Cartman
Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
Butters
You mean it's like, like a monster?
Cartman
It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
Token
Nuh-uh!
Cartman
[angrily points at him] Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
Clyde
[offscreen] You guys, check this out! [Butters, Kenny, Craig and Token go there to take a look. On the ground lies a dead bird.]
Cartman
[keeps the boys away] Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
Butters
AAAAAAHHH! [scared as hell, flees]
Cartman
Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
Kyle
Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
Cartman
I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
Kyle
I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
Cartman
Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
Kyle
[sighs] If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
Butters in his bedroom, night. There is thunder and he is indeed scared a lot.
Butters
Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up. [a loud peal of thunder] It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
Cartman
[standing on his bed with camera kit attached to him] Butters.
Butters
AAAAAHHH!
Cartman
Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
Butters
No, it's a school night!
Cartman
Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro! [Butters stammers a bit] I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
A camera recording with a green filter. Butters and Cartman, both equipped as cameramen now, are hunting for a Jewpacabra in the forest. Their faces appear distorted in close-up shots.
Cartman
Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
Butters
You think Jewpacabra is here?
Cartman
Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
Butters
Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
Cartman
You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ. [a rustle comes through the bush] Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING! [to Butters] He's here somewhere.
Butters
Oh God, I'm scared.
Cartman
JESUS IS A LIE!
Butters
Eric, stop it!
Cartman
Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
Butters
I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
Cartman
Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?! [Butters thinks] THERE IS NO CHRIST!
Butters
Jesus is a lie?
Cartman
No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
Butters
Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
Cartman
Sh! You hear that?
Butters
Oh, hamburgers.
Sooper Foods, day. The president is speaking to someone while three of his employees stand behind him.
President
We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story!
Cartman
I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video. [connects his video camera to the TV] What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra. [moves away a bit] And you're the first to see it. [the video shot of Butters and Cartman from last night is played on the TV] This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this. [pauses] 'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for... [an abrupt rustle] right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again. [plays that moment again] Wait for it... wait... there! [pauses to show the motion blurred animal that moves between bushes] Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
Employee 1
That wasn't a dog?
Cartman
It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
Employee 2
What?
Cartman
I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. [the president walks to the window. Employee 1 follows him]
Employee 1
Mr. Billings?
Mr. Billings
[sighs] There's two things that separate Sooper Foods from all the other grocery stores: Fun and safety. What do you think, Peters? What are the chances that this 'Jewpacabra' is real?
Peters
I'm estimating somewhere around .000000001%.
Mr. Billings
[deep sigh] We can't afford to take that chance. Get this kid whatever he needs.
Three helicopters of Sooper Foods are flying. Cartman, Mr. Billings and the third employee from the previous scene are in one of them. Cartman has a map in his hands.
Mr. Billings
So where are we heading first?
Cartman
We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. [points on the map]
Mr. Billings
The Bahamas?
Cartman
That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
Cartman is slinding through a temple-shaped water slide, going through a shark tank.
Cartman
Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! [drops in a pool, then comes out]
The three helicopters are heading for somewhere else. Cartman has a towel around his neck and is drying himself with a handkerchief as well as holding the map.
Mr. Billings
Where to now?
Cartman
Now we head back to Colorado, here. [points on the map] We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization. Cartman leads Mr. Billings and his two employees to the building but is confronted by a pissed off Kyle.
Kyle
Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
Cartman
People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
Kyle
These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
Cartman
These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
Four dumb looking cryptozoologists are examining Cartman's video in their laboratory
Matt
Look at its trajectory. It heads directly to the right. [highlights the blurred image of the supposed Jewpacabra]
Cliff
It can't be human it's too low to the ground. What do you think, Bobo?
Bobo
Bobo thinks scary!
Matt
It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch.
Cliff
It's not big enough to be a Squatch.
Matt
So it's a baby Squatch?
Cliff
That's what I'm thinking.
Cartman
I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
Matt
Jewpacabra?
Cartman
It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
Bobo
Oh, Jewpacabra, that sounds scary!
Cliff
But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left.
Cartman
Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
Mr. Billings
All the kids will be so disappointed.
Bobo
Whoa, look at this! I just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video! It's all orangie! [the image of Jewpacabra is colored in orange]
Cliff
But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!
Cartman
Heh. What do you mean? [he is stunned]
Cliff
We've never seen this before! It really is true!
Cartman
Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
Matt
No it's impossible. Look at the zoomy in. If I drop image of a dog next to it... [drops an cut-out image of a dog] That thing is way to big to be a dog. And check out the thermals coming off of it.
Bobo
That's the thermals. They make a proof and the thermals!
Matt
That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell.
Cartman
Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
Matt
I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave.
Cartman
Why?
Cliff
'Cause you took the video of this thing. It's not gonna like that.
Matt
If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you. [Cartman is scared a lot. Creepy music plays]
Cartman's room, night. He is in his bed, frightened a lot, mimicing Butters' scene.
Cartman
There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real. [loud thunder] Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah. [quickly makes a call with his cellphone] Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real? [Kyle is listening to him in his bed with his eyes half-closed] I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
Kyle
What are you doing?
Cartman
Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? [Kyle hangs up and goes back to sleep. His phone rings again, causing him so throw it to the wall.]
South Park Church, night. The church is decorated for Easter. Cartman is alone there, sitting on one of the pews. He is singing with a shaky voice as well as holding a rosary.
Cartman
Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect [speaks on his radio]

Everything still clear out there?
Butters, Craig and Token are guarding the church. They have a shotgun, a bat and a flashlight respectively.
Cartman
[voice only] Guys?!
Butters
It's all quiet out front, Eric.
Cartman
Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
Butters
He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. [a boom breaks out. The three boys take to their heels, screaming]
Cartman
[in the church] What? What was that? Butters? Token?! [the door is forced] Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh! [quickly hides between the candle stands] You guys?! GUYS!
Butters
[though the radio] Hey, Eric.
Cartman
It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
Butters
Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. [he is definitely at Wingstreet, and Craig and Token are buying some meal]
Cartman
Wingstreet?!
Butters
Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
Cartman
Dude, I want wings! [there is some knocking on another door] Ahghgh!!! [it turns out to be Mr. Billings and his two employees.] Oh Jesus, it's only you!
Mr. Billings
Alright, grab him.
Cartman
HUH?!
Employee 3
You say the Jewpacabra hunts for anything Easter, and now it's looking for you. [the two employees take him away]
Cartman, in his Easter bunny costume, is chained to a rock in the park, holding a basket.
Cartman
Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
Mr. Billings
Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice.
Cartman
OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME! [Employee 3 brushes his face with the blood of a chicken which is in the bucket he holds] What the-?
Mr. Billings
Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.
Cartman
This isn't safe or fun!
Mr. Billing
Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay? [a howl is heard] Oh fuck, we better get out of here. [Mr. Billings and his employees flee away]
Cartman
NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
The Broflovski house, night. The doorbell rings, Kyle gets the door. It it Mr. Billings and his employees.
Mr. Billings
Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company. [Kyle just looks] But... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on Easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. Thank you. [the three walk away. Kyle looks behind them]
It is surely cold out there and snowing. Cartman is despairingly weeping and collecting the Easter eggs he can find. Kyle shows up, Cartman notices.
Cartman
[smiles] Kyle! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks at him with his eyes half-closed] I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
Kyle
Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
Cartman
Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble! [Kyle frowns and walks away] No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money! [softly] Oh God, what am I doing? [shouts] I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke! [softly] Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
It's fullmoon and the snow has stopped. Cartman is still in the park, now sitting on the ground.
Cartman
It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome. [he is peeked by a pair of red slanted eyes with a snoring effect.] I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! [the pair of eyes turn out to be binoculars used by Bobo.]
Cliff
What'dya think, Bobo?
Bobo
No doubt about it! It's a three foot tall bunny-man!
Matt
I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo!
Bobo
Bobo shoot it! [he comes forward to aim, Cartman notices]
Cartman
Bobo?! Bobo, no! [Bobo fires a dart] Wha- [falls over]
Bobo
[dances cheerfully] Bobo got it! Bobo got the bunnymaaan!
Matt
Good shot, Bobo!
Cliff
Now what do we do?
Matt
I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet.
Cliff
Good idea. [they start walking] Wait wait wait wait. We're gonna need to take the evidence.
Bobo
Alright. [takes the dart gun] I got the evidence right here. The dart gun I shot the bunnyman with.
Matt
Alright! Come on, let's go!
Cartman
[seems to be having a dream] Ugh... what... where...
Cartman is shown in Ancient Egypt, dressed as a prince. A huge fly lands in front of him. He turns out to be in the middle of the biblical plagues.
Cartman
Ugh... what? [stands up] What's going on?
Man 1
The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
It starts to rain frogs. Cartman runs away
Cartman
It's raining frogggggsss! [finds Kyle, who is clinbing to the roof of his house on a ladder] Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
Kyle
[bangs a nail into a piece of wood] Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
Cartman
So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
Kyle
That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
Cartman
Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
Kyle
It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
Cartman
What does that mean?
Kyle
It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
Cartman
Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
Kyle
That's just how God is.
Cartman
You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! [Kyle gets angry]
The Pharaoh is sitting in his balcony, seemingly in deep thought. Cartman approaches, then sits next to him.
Cartman
Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
Pharaoh
It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear.
Cartman
But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
Pharaoh
[sighs] It's a complicated political issue, my son. An economic social issue that needs time. We can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the USA?
Cartman
Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. [a bloody frog lands over the edge]
Pharaoh
Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them.
Cartman
But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
Pharaoh
Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children.
Cartman
I love you, dad.
Pharaoh
And I love you son. And our love grows.
Cartman
And our love grows

Both
And our love grows
Like the mighty river of the Nileriver of the Nile
See it flow
We'll never be apart

Cartman
Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children

[he pats a lamb, but it is taken away by Gerald] Huh? [Sheila slices the lamb's head] Nooooooo! [Sheila and Gerald apply the lamb's blood to their door. Kyle watches them] Kyle, why? What are you doing?
</i></poem>

Kyle
This is what God told us to do!
Cartman
No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
Kyle
You'll see! [Cartman runs away but realizes other families are also doing it. He runs though the corpses of lambs]
Cartman
Noooo! [goes inside somewhere, but sees two kids with bloody eyes]
Kid 1
What's happening to us? [both of the kids puke blood and fall over]
Cartman
Noooooo! [runs past a mom and her child]
Child
Mom! Don't let God kill me! [his head explodes and his mom screams]
Cartman
Noooo! [he is confronted by a man]
Man 2
[holds out a flat sandwich] Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!
Cartman
No! The bread's all flat! No! [shoves the bread down and keeps running] Aaaaahhhh! [the Pharaoh has kneeled down. All children around him have their heads explode. Screaming and shouting can be heard in the background]
Pharaoh
Son! We were wrong! I WAS WRONG!
Cartman
We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! [his head explodes, and the Pharaoh crys in despair]
Cartman is shown in reality again. He is in the park, unconscious.
Cartman
[sleeptalking] No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
The Broflovski house, night. Kyle is uncomfortable in his bed. He ultimately gets up and heads to the park with a blanket and bolt cutters. He frowns when he finds Cartman who is shaking and slowly saying to himself "Nooo... Nooo...". He puts the blanket on him and breaks the chains with the bolt cutters. He takes Cartman to his house, putting him in his bed and taking his shoes off. Touching music plays during these events.
South Park Easter Egg Hunt, morning. The audience applauds while Mr. Billings is giving his speech
Mr. Billings
There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number... [looks on his paper] 4 in fun and number 6 in safety. Let the hunt begin. [The woman employee cuts the ribbon to allow chilren to the hunt. They excitedly run all over the place looking for eggs. Some of them attack and fight each other.]
Cartman
[offscreen] I'm alive! [everyone stops. Cartman runs in, gasping for air.] I'm alive, you guys. [holds a blond girl though her shoulders] I don't know how, but I'm alive! [lets go and keeps running] Can you believe it? It's a miracle. [runs to the stage] Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
Butters
[angrily] Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! [the crowd agrees, then resumes their hunting]
Cartman
Hey guys, listen! [nobody cares. He finds Kyle standing there, approaches him, and lets out a deep sigh.] I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
Kyle
Yeah.
Cartman
I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
Kyle
[puts his arm around him] I know, you're not.
Cartman
Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
Kyle
[flatly] Happy Passover, Cartman. [the camera moves up to the sun, which now has a Star of David at the center of it.]
End of Jewpacabra

Butterballs
South Park Elementary Cafeteria, lunchtime. Five boys are seated at a table: Cartman and Kyle on one side; Craig, Kenny, and Stan on the other. There's room for a third boy next to Kyle
Cartman
Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all "my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that." But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay? [the boys ignore him and continue eating] See? You can't remember.
Butters
[walks in with a black right eye] Heh, h-hey fellas. [takes the remaining spot. Stan, Kenny, and Craig look at each other.]
Kyle
Where's your lunch, Butters?
Butters
OH. [looks around nervously] Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
Stan
Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
Butters
...Yeah. [looks down at the table]
Stan
That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
Butters
Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale.
Stan
Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
Butters
Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.
Craig
So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
Butters
Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
Cartman
He has a point.
Kyle
Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
Craig
Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass.
Stan
I can't believe what I'm hearing! [three girls walking by hear this and stop] This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
Red
Good for you, Stan, nice somebody in this school has some balls.
Cartman
I have balls.
Red
Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls.
Cartman
Still balls.
Kyle
Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
Butters
My Grandma?
The Stotch house, living room, day. Stephen and Linda are talking to a sweet-looking elderly woman. Linda and the woman sit at the sofa while Stephen stands behind Linda
Grammy
Well, so then your cousin Albert, Linda, actually has two girls now. One is three and the other's about little Butters' age, I think.
Stephen
Well, speak of the devil.
Linda
Butters, what happened to your eye?
Butters
Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
Grammy
Well sure, you come and sit right here next to Grammy.
Butters
Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?
Stephen
Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea.
Grammy
Oh some tea would be lovely. [Stephen and Linda leave. Instantly Grammy's sweet demeanor vanishes. She raises her left fist and punches Butters on his bruised right eye. Now we know who the bully is.] What's up? [punches him again] Huh? You think you're [punch] tough, huh?
Butters
I just... [holds his hands up in self-defense] don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
Grammy
Think you're fuckin' tough, huh? [punches him again] You don't look fuckin' tough.
Butters
Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.
Grammy
No, you're a little faggot! [grabs him by the collar] You got any more money? Huh?
Butters
No, you took it all!
Grammy
[holds her fist up at him] Why don't you do something about it?! [punches him again] Do somethin', you little bitch! You're Grandma's bitch!
Linda
Here we go. [brings in the tea and sets it on the coffee table. Stephen brings in some lemon bars and does the same]
Grammy
[once again, sweet and kind] Oh, there's the tea. Tea for me. How lucky.
Linda
And your favorite lemon bars.
Grammy
Goodness, what a treat this is.
South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Mackey's office. A man pays him a visit
BB Founder
Mr. Mackey, what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country. Bullying has become an epidemic, I'm afraid, and we at Bully Buckers ™ are trying to stamp it out. What is your school's policy on bullying?
Mr. Mackey
Oh, well uh w-we think that bullyin' is... is, is bad... m'kay, and uh, and when we see bullying in the school, we tell the students, you know, that... uh that that's bad. m'kay?
BB Founder
Aha, well one of your students told us he thinks bullying at your school is getting worse.
Mr. Mackey
Uh who said?
BB Founder
He didn't want that disclosed.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, he's a little Anonymous Andy?
BB Founder
We would like to have an anti-bullying assembly with your students this afternoon.
Mr. Mackey
Uhokay, but uh, today's actually bad. Uh I already have an assembly today on positive thinking.
BB Founder
You believe positive thinking is really what's critical in schools right now? What's wrong with you?!
Mr. Mackey
Wull I mean it kind of wo-uhuh works out.
BB Founder
No, shut up! What kind of counselor says no to an anti-bullying campaign?! Bullying needs to be stopped! Now! This afternoon!
Mr. Mackey
Wah-eh jus- will we he-?
BB Founder
Wuhhh duhhh. You may only have an Internet degree, but why don't you start acting like you're a school counselor and not an uninformed backwards little dork! M'kay?! [the Bully Buckers founder leaves the office and walks towards the hall. Moments later Mr. Mackey walks out of the office crying. He walks to the mic and turns it on]
Mr. Mackey
[barely holding back emotion] Attention students: today we will have an... assembly... on the subject of... bullying. M'kay? [on the hallway several students stand around listening to the announcement] The assembly is mandatory. M'kay? You'd better show up. 'Kay?
The hallway. Red approaches Butters.
Red
Butters? Your grandma's looking for you.
Butters
[quickly slams his locker door shut] My grandma??
Red
She said to meet her outside behind the school.
Butters
Oh hamburgers! [runs off to the closest restroom, runs in and closes the door]
Grammy
[sitting back against the sinks] Hey twerp! [Butters notices her] You went and narc'd on me!
Butters
[startled at first] HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.
Grammy
[walks to the bathroom door with a menacing swagger, locks it, then walks back] I heard somebody brought in an anti-bully counselor! Thought I wouldn't find out, you little narc?!
Butters
Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
Grammy
[walks towards the urinal] Oh look, what's this over here? [picks up the urinal cake] Ohoh, it's a narc puck. This is what narcs have to put in their mouths. Awww, it's got piss all over it. [picks Butters up by the collar and attempts to put the cake into his mouth]
Butters
Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! [he holds her off]
Grammy
Put it in your mouth! Put it in your fuckin' mouth! [someone begins to pull on the bathroom door. Grammy releases Butters and opens the door. Mr. Adler is standing outside] Ohhh hellow.
Mr. Adler
Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked.
Grammy
I'm sorry, Uh I needed the restroom and my grandson brought me to this one. Isn't that right, Butters?
Butters
[looks at the floor] Yes...
Mr. Adler
Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am.
Grammy
Oh thank you so much. [walks out after Mr. Adler, but just as Butters is about to close the door she spins around and confronts him once more] You narc again and you're fuckin' dead! Fuckin' dead, you got it?!
Mr. Adler
This way.
Grammy
Oop, uh coming. [closes the door, leaving Butters to his thoughts.]
The school assembly that afternoon. Every student is in place.
BB Founder
What makes a bully? [stands next to an image of his company's logo: Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™] The truth is there are more bullies at your school than you even think. And the student who lets bullying happen is just as bad as the bully himself. Come on out, Lorraine. [Lorraine comes out. Her hair is disheveled and her pants go up way too high.] I asked your school mate Lorraine here to help me out. [genuflects] Are you bullied in the school, Lorraine?
Lorraine
...d'Yes.
Bucky Bailey
Kids pick on you, call you names?
Lorraine
...Sometimes.
Bucky Bailey
What kind of things do they say to you?
Lorraine
...Ugly ...neh-nerd.
Bucky Bailey
Do they say "Nice pants. Why do you wear them up to your tits?"?
Lorraine
[long pause] No...
Bucky Bailey
[stands up] Bullying affects everyone. And only if the entire school is united against it can bullying ever be stopped. [to Lorraine] Go, go, get out of here. [she leaves] Now what we at Bucky Bailey's Bully Busters ™ like to do is get the schools to make an anti-bullying video. So who would like to be the young student director in charge of our video? [long pause. No one volunteers] We just need one student to be the leader of our anti-bullying campaign. [still no takers] What? Are you all chicken? [begins to act like a chicken] Nobody wants to be in charge of the anti-bullying video? [acts like a chicken, then like a crying baby rubbing his eyes, then back to acting like a chicken.]
Stan
I'll do it! I'll be in charge.
Bucky Bailey
Ooooo, you're a big man?! You wanna show what a big man you are?!
Stan
No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
Red
Good for you, Stan. [kids begin to clap for him. Kyle has a suspicious look.]
Riley
He's cool.
"THE STUDENTS OF SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY PRESENT Stop Bullying. WRITTEN BY STAN MARSH. MUSIC BY STAN MARSH. TITLE SONG SUNG BY STAN MARSH. DIRECTED BY STAN MARSH."
Clyde
You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
Jimmy
Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh! [Stan comes in from screen right]
Stan
Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, [takes Clyde and Red and turns them around] over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying? [guides them back into the school] At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
The Kids of South Park Elementary
[Stan leads the song. He backs up into the lobby and then into the cafeteria]

Bullying isn't cool. Bullying is lame.
Bullying is ugly and has a stupid name.
For a healthy world, bullying's unfit.
And I think I know what we should do to i-it.
Do do do do do to i-it.

[Clyde takes over and backs up to the gym doors]
Let's all get together and make bullying kill itself.
Bullying's an ugly thing
[Wendy takes over in the gym and backs up though two rows of kids tossing basketballs at eat other]
Lets shove its face in the dirt and make bullying kill itself.
[Token takes over and backs up to some stairs, where the Goth kids are sitting]
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.

Cartman
[tarted up, takes over and backs up the stairs]
Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.

The Kids of South Park Elementary
[Stan takes over at the landing between floors and backs up down the hallway and into the library]

We can make it stop. We can stomp it out.
We can beat its ass until it starts to cry.
Let's gang up on it and tell it it smells
And beat its ass worse if it ever te-lls.
If if if it ever te-lls.

[Craig takes over in the library, walks forward, and backs up down the hallway through two rows of cheerleaders and some balloons dropping from the ceiling]
Lets all join together to try to make bullying kill itself.
It'll be fun to see just how bad we can make it feel
and make bullying kill itself.
[Timmy takes over and backs up towards a corner]
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.

Cartman
[takes over at the corner and backs up, pointing at his own crotch]
My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
[Some doors open and a naked Butters is showcased in a steel-framed clear box, being carried out by two sixth graders. The lights go out and special effects appear - neon paint on the kids' faces and a blue glow through the doors. Butters takes over.]

Butters
Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.

Jason
Stupid! (stupid stupid)

Pete
Ugly! (ugly ugly ugly ugly)

Kyle
Pansy.

Older Girl
Dork!

Butters
Can I, can I not do this, please? [the video stops and the hallway lights come on] I don't wanna do this.
Stan
Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
Butters
Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
Stan
Butters, you're the star of the video!
Kyle
He doesn't wanna do it, dude.
Stan
Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters? [Kyle walks off in a huff] Kyle?
In front of the school. Kyle walks out and away. Stan runs out after him
Stan
Kyle? Kyle, dude, where are you going?!
Kyle
[stops, then turns around] Why are you doing this, Stan?
Stan
To stop bullying.
Kyle
You're gonna stop bullying.
Stan
YES.
Kyle
With Cartman singing about his vagina.
Stan
...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Do you realize that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
Kyle
Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
Stan
Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!
Kyle
Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. [turns around and hurries away]
Stan
What the hell does that mean?
Butters' house, evening. The family is having dinner at the table
Grammy
Oh heavens to Betsy, Linda. This is such a yummy yummy ham. I just love your cooking. [takes her fork under the table and jabs Butters with it. He winces in pain.]
Stephen
Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork. [Butters winces again] What's the matter, Butters?
Butters
Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. [Grammy jabs him again, and he winces in pain]
Stephen
Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.
Butters
Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. [the doorbell rings]
Stephen
I'll get it. [rises and walks away]
Grammy
[notices something] Linda, is that a new clock on the wall?
Linda
[looks at the clock] Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe. [while Linda talks, Grammy picks her boogers and smears them on Butters' mashed potatoes] I just love the cute little canary on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. [turns back to Grandma as Stephen brings Butters' friends over.]
Stephen
Your friends wanted to see you, Butters.
Stan
Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
Grammy
Oh, an anti-bullying video? How adorable. [jabs him harder with the fork, and he screams in pain]
Stan
Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
Butters
HAAAAA! [pounds the table fiercely to relieve the pain from Grammy's fork]
Stan
I know, right?! [Stan, Cartman, and Kenny all imitate Butters' pain]
South Park Elementary, day. Stan walks in to a hero's welcome. Cheers greet him as he walks down the hall towards the boys' restroom. He walks in and noticed Mr. Bailey waiting for him with arms crossed.
Bucky Bailey
Whassup?! [walks to the bathroom door and locks it]
Stan
Oh, hey.
Bucky Bailey
You went and made a video and sold it without lettin' me know.
Stan
Huh?
Bucky Bailey
Doin' a video was my idea! It's the property of Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™, you got that?! [crosses his arms again]
Stan
But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
Bucky Bailey
Oh, it's been stwessful?! [gets in his face] What's wrong with you?! Kids are getting bullied at school and with this money, Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™ can finally become the legit organization it deserves to be! You greedy, selfish, little PRICK! [Stan lowers his head in shame] Oh what? You gonna cwy?
Stan
No.
Bucky Bailey
No, go ahead, cwy. Let me see ya. [rubs his eyes as if he's the one crying] Let me see you cwy. [Stan begins to cry]
Stan
[Stan Sobbing.]
Butters' house, night, Butters' room. He's pacing back and forth
Butters
[having a conversation with himself] We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself! [switch] Oh, but violence is never the answer. [switch] But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is! [switch] You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice! [goes into his closet and pulls out a box] Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself! [unpacks his Professor Chaos costume and puts it on] It's time you met... Chaos! [he bursts into the hallway] I've been pushed around for the last time! [runs to the guest bedroom, where Grammy is staying] Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! [bursts into Grammy's room, but is suddenly surprised at what he sees - Grammy in a supervillain outfit]
Grammy
Oh, look, it's Captain Pussy! [Professor Chaos is frozen in place] You can't stop me, Captain Pussy! Don't even try!
Professor Chaos
Grandma? but how di-
Grammy
I got inspired when I came across your gay little costume in your closet. [changes mood] Now come on, Captain Pussy! Time for you to get your Gummi bears!
Professor Chaos
No! Grandma please, nnnot Gummi bears!
Grammy
Come 'ere! [rushes towards him]
Professor Chaos
Ahh! Grandma! [backs into a corner next to a small table. Grammy knocks the table over and pins Chaos against the wall]
Gramm
Stand up for yourself! Fight back! Be a fucking man!
Professor Chaos
I can't.
Grammy
Then it looks like you get... Gummi bears! [reaches into her mouth and pulls out her dentures] Gummy bears! [begins to gnaw at his left arm with her gums]
Professor Chaos
Awww! Eewww!
South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Bailey walks down the hallway to the boys' room. He goes inside and is surprised
Nick Jabs
[waiting with arms crossed] What's up? I'm Nick Jabs, president of the movie company that bought the bully video. [goes to lock the door]
Bailey
Oh what? Stan Marsh got you to come talk to me?! That little cliché conflict resolution Kevin!
Jabs
[advancing, making Bailey back up] The video was conceived, written, and directed by the South Park student body, you got that?!
Bailey
It was my idea. I told the students to make the video and I-and I produced the entire thing! I deserve to have my name on it!
Jabs
Yeah, only problem is America doesn't give a SHIT about an old fart with a Captain Kangaroo haircut! They wanna believe kids did something on their own. [hands him a sealed envelope] Here's a cease and desist letter from our lawyers. If you ever claim any authorship of the video again, we will sue you for everything you have!
Bailey
But... but this was gonna be the thing that finally made Bully Buckers ™ a national organization.
Jabs
Oh, you gonna cwy?! Oh don't cwy, you'll wook bad wif your wittle Captain Kangawoo haircut! [Mr. Bailey goes to the bathroom door, unlocks it, and walks out sobbing]
The hallway, around the same time. Cartman and Kenny are handing out posters and putting them on lockers. Kenny is positioning one of them on a locker as Kyle walks up to them
Cartman
'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. [nearby, Craig and Clyde take notice]
Kyle
Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
Cartman
We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! [blows a raspberry at him]
Kyle
I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere! [walks away] And don't tape that to my locker! [walks into the boys' room and sees Stan waiting by the sink with arms crossed] Oh God. [Stan goes to lock the door]
Stan
What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
Kyle
Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
Stan
Butters is totally fine with it, dude.
Kyle
Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him, and neither do you!
Stan
Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
Kyle
What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
Stan
Oh yeah.
Kyle
Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
Stan
This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
Kyle
If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?! [long pause] Well?!
Stan
...What, what was the question again?
Kyle
[slowly] If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet, for free?!
Stan
...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
Kyle
[turns around and walks out] Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! [closes the door.]
Stan
[left wondering] Why does he keep saying that?
The Dr. Oz Show
Dr. Oz
We all know that bullying has become an epidemic. Like AIDS, bullying is escalating and is spread mostly by penises. But now a few school kids are trying to make a difference with a video to make bullying kill itself. [Switch to Camera 2, which shows Stan and Butters seated next to Dr. Oz. Butters is not too happy to be there, so he rests his head on his right hand] I'm joined by the film's director as well as the weak little boy who's the main subject of the film. Stan, congratulations on all your success.
Stan
Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. [the audience applauds]
Dr. Oz
And how about you? What would you like to say to your bully out there?
Butters
Oh uh, nothin'.
Dr. Oz
Come on, this is for everyone who's been a victim. What do you wanna say to bullies all across America? Go ahead. [Butters raises his head] Right now. Say it.
Butters
Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
Dr. Oz
Do you hear that, bullies? Stop making kids say things on your TV shows! [the audience applauds] What else do you wanna say, Butters?
Butters
[feeling cornered] Please, leave me alone.
Dr. Oz
Leave him alone! But that doesn't work, does it Butters?
Butters
No it doesn't.
Dr. Oz
Tell us in graphic detail what the bully does to you?!
Butters
Stop it!
Dr. Oz
Come on, this is for America! [Stan begins to get concerned. Butters looks to Stan for some reassurance] Do you realize that in America, ohohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to go to school because of bullying?! [Butters' anger begins to rise] Don't you care?! You better care! [Butters loses it and attacks Dr. Oz. The audience cheers him on. Dr. Oz collapses to the floor and Butters begins to punch him in the face]
The movie company's head office, day. Stan has been summoned to the office
Mr. Jabs
What the hell were you thinking?! Everyone just saw that the bully victim in your movie is actually a violent psychopath!
Stan
I didn't know.
Mr. Jabs
This could kill our box office. People are gonna come after us now, saying we didn't check our facts!
Stan
I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
Mr. Jabs
It's your fuckin' movie! Now I'm gonna have to work overtime with marketing to make sure people still sympathize with our victim! Jesus, just get the fuck out of here! I've gotta go to the bathroom! [goes to the bathroom as Stan leaves. Inside the bathroom he runs into Jesus with his arms crossed] Uh oh.
Jesus
My child, [goes to lock the door] have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad.
Mr. Jabs
Uh... [lowers his head]
Jesus
Oh, what are you gonna do? cwy now?
Grammy's room, night. Butters cracks the door open and walks in while she's asleep. She's facing away from him, so he can't see how she responds
Butters
Grandma? I did it, Grandma. [she opens her eyes] I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnot outta Dr. Oz. [she frowns] I can't lie, it felt kind of good. [she smiles] At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time. [her smile fades] Poor old Grandma. You know, I-I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die. [the anger leaves Grammy's face] Someday pretty soon. [he approaches Grammy] And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you. [walks back to the door] 'Night Grandma. [exits and closes the door]
South Park Elementary, next morning. Stan walks through the front doors and the students all boo him and throw wads of paper at him
Stan
Huh? Aw, come on! [comes across Clyde, Craig, and Cartman and stops] Dude, what's going on?
Clyde
You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bull-crap bullying video!
Stan
Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
Cartman
The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
Red
You made us look like uncaring idiots!
Craig
Yeah. Boooo!
Stan
How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
Timmy
[rolls up] Boooo!
Stan
[moves off a bit] Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.
Mr. Mackey
Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?!
Stan
[sighs in resignation] I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.
A plane moves through the sky and lands at San Diego International Airport. Stan walks through the airport with two suitcases, then through the San Diego Zoo, then through Coronado Island, then takes a taxi ride through the Gaslamp District.
Singer (background singers)
Baaam badam baaam baaadam. Baaam badam bam
Baaam badam baaam baaadam. Baaam badam bam

I'm gonna jack it where the sun always shines. (He's gonna jack it)
Been spreadin' the word and now I need to ease my mind. (Jackin' it)
(Ohhhh...) Been plantin' them apple seeds and while the apples grow,
I'm gonna go out jackin' it in San Diego! [the singers pop up]

(Jackin' it, jackin' it, jackin' it jack
Spankin' it, jackin' it, spankin' it smack)

[Stan is at a street corner and begins to undress]
I don't need no shirt, no, gonna take 'dem pants right off (he's about to jack it)
On such a bright day who needs underwear or socks? (Jackin' jack it)
(Ohhhh...) Been around God's country, and there's one thing I know. [Stan begins to dance]
There's no better place for jackin' it than San Diego!

[the two background singers arrive and stand between Stan and the camera]
(Jack it, jack it, jackin' it jack
Smackin' it, smackin' it, smackin' it smack
Jackin' it, jackin' it, jackin' it jack [the lead singer comes in]
Jackin' it, smackin' it, smackin' it smack) Jackin' for the Loooord!

Jerry Sanders
[Mayor of San Diego] Come to San Diego. There's so much to see. [real photos of the places he mentions appear] From the sparkling waters of Mission Bay to the warm tortillas of Old Town. And after a day of sight-seeing, why not try spankin' it in one of our charming city streets? San Diego. Come, take a load off. [Behind him, Stan is still dancing at the street corner]
The three singers are at Sea World. Stan dances across the screen at Coronado Island with his back to the camera, then dances at a Mission-style building, then is back at the corner masturbating at passing cars. Someone captures the spectacle from a nearby window. A priest walks by reading a newspaper. He notices Stan and is surprised enough to lose the paper
Singer (background singers)
(Jackin' it, jackin' it, jackin' it jack
Spankin' it, spankin' it, smackin' it smack
A whackin' it, whackin' it, whackin' it whack
Smackin' it, jerkin' it, smackin' it smack)
The cars are passin' me by, they're honkin', say hello.

Passenger
[from a passing car] Hey that guy's jackin' it!
Singer (background singers)
From his window there's a guy shootin' video. (Video of him jackin' it)
And if the good Lord Jesus comes knockin' on my door,
Just tell him that I'm jackin' it in San Diego. 
[a tourist map shows up with Stan dancing on it]

(Jackin' it, jackin' it, jackin' it jack
Spankin' it, spankin' it, smackin' it smack (he's about to jack it)
Whack it jack it whack it jack it whackin' it jack
Whack it whack it smack whack whackin' it whack)

End of Butterballs

I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining
The opening shots this week parody those of "I Shouldn't Be Alive", with dramatic zooms and pans. Then a shot of Stan running in zipline gear
Stan
Kyle! [his voice echoes as he looks around frantically]
The opening shots again
Narrator
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [A shot of Kyle going down the zip line]
Kyle
AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! [a shot of Cartman moving down the zip line helplessly]
Cartman
Somebody help us! [motion blur back to opening shots]
Narrator
Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out. [a shot each of Kyle, Kenny, and Stan screaming, then of a bloodied Stan on the zip line, then of Cartman, then of Kyle] The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
Kyle
[being interviewed] We were stuck. We were completely stuck. [cut to Cartman running]
Cartman
Kyle, hurry! [a shot of Stan with Kyle]
Stan
Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! [a shot each of Kyle, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman screaming, then of the four boys on a wooden platform at the top of a zip line, then of Cartman, then of a trip through the esophagus, then of Cartman, and back to the first shot]
Narrator
For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of "I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining".
Cartman
[inside a van, in a window seat] Oh God!
Stan
[running towards the camera] No!
"The events in this film took place over 4 hours in the Colorado Rockies"
Stan
Help! We're trapped! [A shot of all four boys bloodied and woozy] We've gotta get out of here!
"This is a true story."
A bright sun rises over the town of South Park
Narrator
It's the last day of Spring break, [a shot of the school] and all over the small mountain town of South Park, [back at the park, kids play on the basketball court or go down a slide, or fly kites.] students are trying to have as much fun as possible. [a girl shows off her dog to two friends, a boy aims his water gun at another boy and runs after him, two other boys toss a football between them. The camera stops at a table with four boys. Tow of them sit at the bench, two others stand. Kenny plays with a twig] For ten year old Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the last day has come too soon.
Stan
[being interviewed] We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
Kyle
We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
Cartman
Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
Kenny
[offended] (What?!)
Cartman
Look at his lip. [to Kenny] You've got herpes, dude.
Kenny
[throws the twig away] (This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
Cartman
No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
Stan
Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
Kyle
[being interviewed] And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
Cartman
Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
Kyle
We've definitely not done that before!
Stan
I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
Kyle
Cool! Ziplining.
Cartman
Ziplining. Hell yeah.
Narrator
Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo. [a shot of the boys chattering in the back]
Cartman
[being interviewed] We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
Cartman
Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him. [leans over to see how close his finger can reach without touching] Zi- [Kenny puts his right mitten over his mouth and Cartman pulls his left hand back playfully] Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
Kenny
(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)
Cartman
Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister. [laughs] You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
Narrator
It's the idyllic spring break getaway with friends and laughter. [a shot of the boys cheering as they approach Backcountry Adventures]
Inside Backcountry Adventures, day
Clerk
Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?
Stan
Yeah.
Clerk
All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.
Kyle
[being interviewed] And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, "Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous."
Clerk
[he's got the boys dressed up] All right, you guys look ready to zipline!
Cartman
Alright!
Clerk
Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.
Stan
[being interviewed] And we were like, "Other? We have to do this with other people?" [a shot of the boys entering the waiting room, where there are seven other people waiting]
Woman 1
Hi there.
Man 1
Hello.
Woman 2
Hi
Narrator
The boys have just made a sobering discovery. [a shot of Stan's internal organs and spine] For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down. [this is shown] The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family. [Stan's brain and skull are shown] But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour.
Woman 2
[quite pregnant] Hey, how are you?
Stan
[mimicking] Good. How are you?
Kyle
[being interviewed] So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. [the couple arrives]
Clerk
Alright, our last zipliners are here. [Kyle and Cartman are visibly angry]
Man 2
Sorry we made you wait, everybody. [A shot of Kyle's mouth interior is shown]
Narrator
Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, "Dude, fuck you!"
Kyle
We don't mind.
Cartman
[being interviewed] Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. [the benches are rearranged so the zipliners can watch a TV screen above them]
Clerk
Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!
Michael
[who's just the clerk, naturally] Hey there Michael. [Everyone behind the boys laughs.]
Stan
[being interviewed] It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. [return to the tour]
Michael
Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael.
Michael
Thanks Michael. [turns off the TV] Anybody have any questions?
Cartman
...No.
Man 2
I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again? [the boys are stunned that this needs to be done]
Stan
[being interviewed] "Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?"
Michael
Let's get out there and get zippin'! [everyone rises and heads out of the waiting room]
Kyle
Jesus Christ!
Cartman
Finally!
Narrator
The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse.
Outside Backcountry Adventures
Michael
Here we go guys! Zipliniiin'! [goes into an open-leg stance, makes a fist with his left hand, holding out the thumb and pinkie]
Guide 1
[a woman, waiting by a van that has been out earlier in the day] Everyone just step on in the shuttle. [opens the van's sliding door. The zipliners head for it]
Stan
...Shuttle?
Kyle
How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
Michael
It's about forty-five minutes.
Narrator
It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear. [a look at Kyle's brain] His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word "shuttle" makes Kyle's brain fire neurons [this is shown] that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be. [two images of overloaded shuttle buses appear, then footage of the Space Shuttle Challenger going up and exploding, and Kyle is scared]
Cartman
Well, come on, we don't have a choice. [leads the others to the shuttle van.]
The shuttle ride, later. It sure is bumpy.
Michael
Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?
Stan
Uh that's okay.
Man 3
Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought- [Cartman begins to mutter angrily]
Narrator
[hour 2] It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle.
Michael
We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!
Adults
Wooo!
Narrator
But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing. [Cartman is drinking some Mountain Dew from a can. The camera looks around the van] Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen. [the camera goes down Eric's esophagus] Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months. [the camera comes back up the esophagus and out Cartman's mouth] And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back down Cartman's throat] The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas. [a quick journey through the intestines is shown] When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter. [the sphincter is shown] Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage. [this is shown, along with Kyle's reaction]
Kyle
Dude, did you fart?!
Cartman
Mmmm, no?
Michael
Alright buys, we're here! [The van pulls up to the first entrace to Zipline Adventures. Both Stan and Kenny look sleepy]
Stan
Thank God. [everyone is out of the van as Guide 1 goes up to the launch pad two stories up. The pad is attached to a pine tree]
Michael
Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?
Cartman
The trees' biology?
Michael
We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes.
Stan
I think we're good.
Man 2
[raises his left hand] I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.
Michael
Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-
Stan
[being interviewed] So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! [Cartman is hooked up]
Michael
Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work. [a shot of the tour group] Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out "Shockabra!", look up and give the camera a nice "shockabra" [two fists with thumbs and pinkies extended]. Alright, you ready?
Cartman
Yeah. [Michael shortens the strap between Cartman and the zipline, and holds him up]
Michael
Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?
Cartman
Yeah.
Michael
Alright, let's hear you say "Zipliiine!"
Cartman
Zipliiine. [Michael sends him on his way]
Michael
[voice-over] Shockabra! [Cartman holds out his fists as indicated above and the camera takes his picture]
Guide 1
Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!
Kyle
Well? How was it, Cartman?
Cartman
Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
Stan
[as Kyle is prepped] Oh, really??
Cartman
Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
Michael
Alright Kyle, give me a "Zipliiine!"
Kyle
Zipline. [Michael sends him on his way]
Michael
Shockabra! [does the fists. Kyle does the fists too and the camera takes his picture, but he's mad]
Kyle
[being interviewed] It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
Narrator
After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens.
Michael
Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! [the others cheer, but the boys are worried.]
Cartman
[being interviewed] "The next zipline? What are you talking about?"
Kyle
E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
Michael
This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.
Stan
[being interviewed] And it was like WHAM. [makes a fist with his right hand and punches his left handn with it.]
Kyle
STOP!
Cartman
NOOOO!
Guide
Everyone back in the shuttle!
Kyle, Cartman
NOOOO! [the adults and a fifth kid get back into the van]
Narrator
The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun. [the boys scream and some scens of the next ziplines flash by: Michael sends someone down the zipline, he plays guitar during a break "led me through that"]
Guide
Anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross?
Man 2
Yes.
Boys
AAAA! [shots of Kyle, Kenny, and Stan]
Adults
"Ack" went the little frog one day. "Ack" went the little green frog...
Cartman
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! [opening shots return]
Michael
Let 'er rip! [sends Man 2 on his way]
Man 4
Zipliiine!
Narrator
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
Michael
Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.
Kyle
Wugh!
Narrator
Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.
Pete
But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- [Woman 1 is shown going down, then man 1, then]
Man 2
[with his wife] Could you get another picture of us? [hands Kyle the camera]
Kyle
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [a shot of the whole group is shown]
Narrator
The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
Cartman
[on his way down a zipline.] I'm so fucking bored! [Hour 3 arrives. Michael sends the next zipliner on down. The others cheer her on]
Michael
Alright, you going next, Ricky? [hooks Ricky up and sends him down]
The Boys
[on the ground] Help! Somebody! Help us! [the adults on the launch pad cheer the next zipliner down]
Kyle
It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
Stan
There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
Kyle
[grabs Stan's arms] Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! [another zipliner goes down]
Zipliner
Zipline!
Adults
Woohoo!
Cartman
We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
Kyle
Me?!
Cartman
Yeah you! In the park this morning?! "I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!"
Kyle
Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
Cartman
I brought it up because you already brought it up!
Stan
[being interviewed] That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
Kyle
You fat piece of shit!
Cartman
Fuck you Kyle!
Stan
Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
Cartman, Kyle
Yes!
Stan
Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
Narrator
But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea. [the camera goes down Cartman's throat.] Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea. [the camera goes back up his throat and out his mouth] But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew. [the camera goes back in] His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste. [a quick trip through Cartman's intestines, as before] The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear. [this is shown, and the smell wafts up into Kyle's nose] Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb.
Kyle
DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
Cartman
Nnnn-mo...
Stan
[being interviewed] So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
Michael
All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch.
Guide
[standing in a covered lunch area] Come in by the waterfall, gang! [it's a small waterfall]
Stan
Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
Man 2
Skip a free lunch? Not me! [runs to the lunch area. The other zipliners follow]
Guide
Wo wants sandwiches? [pulls out sealed sandwiches from a portable ice box] We got ...turkey. [Man 2 takes that one] Ham. [another zipliner takes that one] Turkey ham. [another zipliner takes that one...]
Pete
[in the background] Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. [in the foreground the boys are sitting on their own log with the word HELP on the ground before them made with twigs and branches]
Cartman
Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! [keeps sipping the Double Dew]
Kyle
The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
Cartman
This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew. [at the bottom of the can is a blurb saying "DEW THE MATH!"] Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
Kyle
You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
Cartman
If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
Stan
[runs up to the tour guides] Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
Michael
Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?
Stan
...Yyyeah.
Guide
That's not herpes, it's a cold sore.
Michael
Right, sorry.
Stan
Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
Michael
Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down.
Some adults
Zipline! Wooo!
Guide
What about the stables?
Michael
Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.
Kyle
[being interviewed] Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
Rancher
Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?
Stan
Yea, please!
Rancher
Well I think we can set ya up.
Kyle
Oh, thank God!
Stan
You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
Rancher
Step right out here, we'll get you going. [leads the boys out to a horseback riding tour] Got four more for you, Duncan. [All the riders wave and say hello, and a few take pictures]
Cartman
NOOO! [opening shots return]
Narrator
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
Kyle
AAAAH! [the boys are now shown on horseback in this order: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny]
Cartman
[still aching] Eeeeugh.
Narrator
Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour. [the camera tries some dramatic moves]
Kyle
Can we please go faster?!
Kenny
(I can't take it!)
Duncan
We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.
Kyle
AAAAAAAAAAH!
Cartman
Uh oh. [lets out a wet fart]
Rider 1
[to Kyle] So anyway, long story short, I was born in 1953 at six in the morning.
Narrator
An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining"
The lunch site, moments later.
Duncan
This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls. Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?
Rider 2
Well I certainly would! [Other riders do too. Nearby, Kyle has collapsed]
Stan
Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!
Kyle
Just go. Go without me.
Stan
No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!
Kyle
I can't take it anymore. [his voice gets weaker] Why do people say "long story short"? They're not making it short, Stan.
Stan
[being interviewed] I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought "I can find us a way out!" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
Stan
[returns from his search quite excited] You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
Cartman
A marina?
Stan
We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
Kyle
What's the point?
Stan
Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! [an announcer says the following lines]
"The following program contains graphic re-enactments that may be disturbing to some audience members." The marina. This is the live-action segment of the episode
Narrator
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [shots of the boys screaming on various parts of the boat] Trapped on a 42-foot powerboat [named Puffin] which is only allowed to go five miles an hour. [some footage is dropped to speed up the boat in time-lapse form]
Kyle
Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
Cartman
Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
Kyle
Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
Narrator
The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
Cartman
Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
Kenny
[slurring his speech] I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
Narrator
For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... "I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat" [more shots of the boys on the Puffin]
Kyle
Oh no. [Cartman lowers a 20-oz. bottle of Mountain Dew] You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
"The events in this film took place over 4 hours in the Colorado Rockies." Cartman is shitting over the side of the boat, Stan screams, Kyle and Kenny vomit over other sides, Cartman continues to shit
Kenny
Beavers! [a beaver is swimming in the water]
"This is a true story."
The boys are resting on a bench on the boat now
Narrator
After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining.
Stan
[being interviewed] The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
Cartman
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Narrator
If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die. [Stan looks ready to sleep. Cartman takes a swig of Mountain Dew]
Kyle
Here! [takes Cartman's bottle] Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
Kyle
[being interviewed] I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
Cartman
I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
Kenny
Hey. [tugs on Cartman, who turns to look at him] Fuck you, Cartman.
The Puffin, some time later
Narrator
Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. [individual shots of the boys. They all have oral herpes now] And just when it seems it can't get any worse... [the boys are nodding off again]
Stan
...Kenny? Kenny! [Kenny has slid down on the seat, but his eyes are open]
Narrator
Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.
Kyle
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
Cartman
No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
Kyle
IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
Stan
[being interviewed] And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said "Stop it!"
Stan
[rises and walks a bit] Stop it! It was me! My idea.
Cartman
You?!
Stan
Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out the brochure for Backcountry Adventures, then looks at it for a few seconds] I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. [Kyle and Cartman look at each other]
Kyle
So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
Stan
[turns to face them] If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. [the camera pans down and sure enough, the offer is on the brochure cover: Sign up 3 friends and get an iPod NANO!!!]
Kyle
You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
Stan
I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
Cartman
[points at Stan] You... You killed Kenny! [Stan begins to weep]
Kyle
You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! [a shot of Kenny, then a shot of the three surviving boys crying. Kyle cries on Cartman's shoulder and Cartman comforts him]
Kyle
[being interviewed] How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
Stan
[being interviewed, crying] The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back. [wipes away the flowing tears] I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
Narrator
But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. [the boys look around, startled]
Cartman
[being interviewed] It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
Cartman
You came for us!
Kyle
Mr. Hankey!
Stan
Thank you. [whispers] Mr. Hankey. [Mr. Hankey has landed on the boat, at the top of an armrest]
Mr. Hankey
[without the falsetto voice] Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home. [the boys are overjoyed at their good fortune]
Cartman
[being interviewed] We were saved. It was over.
Narrator
After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter. [shown, the images are back to the cartoon form] In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven. [a jet plane made of poo] From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express. [The ziplining Shockabra pictures are shown] Four friends, turn apart by tragedy [Kenny's image vanishes, leaving the forest background in place], would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents. [Mr. Hankey delivers them personally. The parents are distraught] And the boys received treatment for their herpes. [two paramedics treat Stan and Cartman as Mr. Hankey looks on from above. Stan and Cartman focus on Mr. Hankey.]
Cartman
[being interviewed] No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
Narrator
[shots of the scenes being described are shown] Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining. [a lecture tour. Stan is shown on stage with a "No on Ziplining" logo] His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman, [shown as a mountaineer] he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math.
Cartman
[being interviewed] It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. [takes a long sip]
End of I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining

Cartman Finds Love
South Park Elementary, hallway, day. The kids are milling around as Butters' wail is heard.
Butters
[runs across the hallway] Fellas! Fellas! Fellas! [spots them in another hallway and runs to them] AAAAH, fellas!
Stan
What? [most of the fourth grade boys gather around]
Butters
[stops and catches his breath, then jabs his right index finger at the floor] Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
Cartman
What?
Butters
[jabs his finger again] Guess!
Kyle
Just tell us, Butters.
Butters
There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
Craig
Oh, we have a new cheerleader?
Clyde
What's she look like?
Kenny
(Yeah, what's her name?)
Cartman
[taking control of the situation] Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
The school gym, moments later. Some double doors are open and Butters peeks in. The other boys gather behind him, and soon all their jaws drop.
Butters
Look, look, there she is. [near the bleachers opposite the doors are five girls: Red, Wendy, Bebe, Lola, and Jenny. Between Wendy and Bebe are two pompoms waiting for a sixth cheerleader, who arrives shortly. It's a black girl. The other five girls begin talking to her all at once]
Cartman
Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked? [Token looks over at him. The girls start practicing] Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
Token
[anger flashes across his face] Why?! Why are you happy for me?!
Cartman
Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
Token
Nothing! [walks away]
Cartman
[confused] What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
Fourth Grade class, some time later. Mr. Garrison is at the blackboard teaching the class about Game of Thrones
Mr. Garrison
And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon [circles BARATHEON on the board], and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? So where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- [during the lecture, the following takes place]
Cartman
[fairly whispering throughout, beginning when Mr. Garrison mentions Lord Stark. He sits between Token and the new girl and grins as he looks at each of them by turn] Dude... Token! [jerks his head a bit in the girl's direction and points at her] Token. Dude. [Token looks at him, then goes back to taking notes. Cartman smiles] Psst. Token. [points to the girl again, but puts his right hand up so she doesn't notice. Token is annoyed] Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
Kyle
[annoyed as well] Will you shut the hell up?! [goes back to taking notes. Cartman finally picks up his pen, but doesn't write anything]
Cartman
...Token. You want me to pass her a jelly bean?
Token
[whispers back] No!
Cartman
Huh?
Token
[louder] No!
Mr. Garrison
[stops talking and turns to the class] Token, is there a problem? [Token is a loss for words, but Cartman fields this question]
Cartman
Ah, he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis. [begins to laugh at his own joke] Right guys? [tries to hold the laugh in]
Mr. Garrison
Everyone pay attention! [goes back to the board] Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- [while Garrison resumes his lesson, Cartman resumes his prodding]
Cartman
[quickly looks at the girl and at Token] Token. [leans back in his seat so Token has a clear view of the girl] Dude, dude. Dude.
South Park Elementary, hallway. Bebe and Red are at Bebe's locker, talking.
Red
So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us.
Cartman
[approaching] Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
Bebe
[shuts her locker] Why?!
Cartman
[motions to his left] Just, can I talk to you, real quick? [walks the girls over to the end of the hallway] What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
Red
About Token? Why?
Cartman
Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
Bebe
Token likes Nichole?
Cartman
Yeah, of course. [the girls look at each other]
Red
Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea.
Cartman
Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
Bebe
Okay.
Cartman
Thanks, you guys.
Bebe's basement, day. She and the other five cheerleaders are playing the board game, Living. Lola rolls the dice and releases them.
Lola
[moves up four steps] One two three four, sorry Bebe.
Bebe
Oh, that's okay. [the girls laugh about it] So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.
Lola, Jenny, Red, and Wendy
Ohhh.
Nichole
Oh my gosh, who?
Red
That boy Token.
Wendy
Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. [the other girls chime in, showing their support. The camera pulls back a bit, and Cartman is shown eavesdropping just outside a basement window]
Nichole
Oh jeez, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.
Bebe
[excited] Who? Whowhowhowho?
Nichole
That kid, with the orange coat and the green hat?
Wendy
Oh, you mean Kyle?
Nichole
Yeah.
The Girls
Ooooh, Kyle.
Cartman
WHAT?! KYLE?! [the girls don't hear him]
Bebe
Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
The Girls
K-I-S-S-O-M-G!
Nichole
Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. [the girls laugh while Cartman gets livid]
Cartman
Motherfucker! [gets up and runs off]
South Park Elementary, next day. The girls are practicing on the football field as three random boys watch from the bleachers
The Girls
We are Cows, proud and true! Count on South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows! [Cartman approaches Nichole]
Cartman
Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
Nichole
Yeah. [Wendy stops practicing]
Cartman
Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here? [takes her to another set of bleachers nearby] Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
Nichole
[taken aback] Oh no, who told you that?
Cartman
Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know. [fakes a sweat] Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together?
Nichole
Ohhh.
Cartman
Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
Nichole
Wow, I-I'm sorry. I totally respect that. [puts her right hand on his left shoulder] Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.
Cartman
Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
Nichole
[withdraws her hand] Oh, I'm sorry.
Cartman
Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. [snaps his fingers and walks away]
The hallway, later. Kyle is at his locker putting some books away. Nichole approaches him
Nichole
Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.
Kyle
Oh, thanks. [smiles. Nichole turns and walks away, smiling. Kyle sees Craig and Timmy nearby and runs towards them] Dude, that new girl's into me!
Another hallway. Cartman hides around the corner and makes like he's real cool, wearing shades and with hands in his jacket pockets, one foot resting on the wall. Butters walks past him on the cross-hallway without noticing
Cartman
Psst Butters. Butters! [Butters stops and notices, then walks over to Cartman] At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
Butters
How come?
Cartman
[takes off his shades] Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
Butters
Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
Cartman
No no. [walks him towards the camera] Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
The football field, after PE. Nichole packs her pompoms away as Butters arrives with towels for Nichole to deliver
Butters
Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. [hands her the towels]
Nichole
Oh, he does? [Butters nods] Okay.
The boys' locker room. Token is taking a shower alone when Cartman leans in to check on him, then walks away. The other boys are changing into their regular clothes.
Cartman
Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! [the boys make a break for the front of the school and exit the front doors]
In front of the school.
Craig
Where?
Jimmy
I-I don't see a b-b-Bat-Mobile.
Back at the gym, Nichole reaches the boys' locker room, opens the door, and backs into the room. Cartman looks from around a corner and sees her go in. He has a chain and lock with him, and as soon as the door closes he goes and locks them with the chain
Nichole
[keeps walking, unaware of what Cartman just did] Hello??
Token
[walks in dressed in a towel and drying his face with another] AAA!
Nichole
OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry!
Token
Where is everybody? What's goin' on??
Nichole
Coach wanted me to... [winces] I'm sorry. [drops the towels, turns and goes back to the doors. She tries to open them but can't]
The neighborhood, afternoon. Some of the students are walking together: Kyle, Craig, and Timmy in back, Lola and Jenny up front.
Kyle
Hey guys. Guys! Hold up. [runs up to the girls, who stop and turn to face him] Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
Jenny
Yeah?
Kyle
Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
Lola
She likes... movies, cats.
Jenny
[to Lola] She likes basketball.
Kyle
Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
Lola
Well- Hey Kyle, [he stops and returns] we were gonna head over to the mall. You wanna go with us?
Kyle
Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! [runs off]
Jenny
Guess he has a crush on Nichole.
Lola
[looks away for a moment] I don't think so. I heard Kyle swings for the same team.
Jenny
Really?!
Kyle
[back with Craig and Timmy] It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game. [looks back at the girls, who look at him, then giggle as he turns back to the boys] Man, I-I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. [looks back at the girls and waves. They grin and wave back]
Back in the locker room, Token tries to get himself and Nichole out, but groans and doesn't get anywhere
Token
Hey! In here! [punches the door]
Nichole
You think the janitors are still here?
Token
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. [takes her around the locker room. Nichole notices a table with food and some other things on it]
Nichole
Look! [walks to the table] Somebody left a deli platter. [Token joins her] And board games. And massage oil.
Token
Oh... Good.
The school, just after sunrise. Firefighters have arrived at the locker room and have snapped the chain in two with bolt cutters.
The school, out front. The firefighters have taken Token and Nichole outside and left them alone as they leave.
Nichole
Well that was sure an interesting night.
Token
It sure was.
Nichole
Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been really scary.
Token
Yeah. Now that it's over, I... I guess it was kind of fun. [smiles]
Nichole
Yeah, it kind of was. Maybe... I-I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.
Cartman
[hiding in the bushes, weeping silently] Oh my God, sooo cute.
Token
I'd like that.
Nichole
Cool. Well... thanks again. [they hug each other]
Cartman
[sweetly] Ohhhhh my God.
Cupid Me
[pops out of Cartman's head] We did it, Eric. We found them each other's ray of sunshine.
Cartman
You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. [tickles the little cupid]
Cupid Me
Teeheeheehee. [pops back into Cartman's head, leaving behind a trail of hearts]
Montage. Cartman sings "I Swear" as Token and Nichole get to know each other better.
Cartman
I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know, my heart
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart

I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?

South Park Elementary, playground, recess. As the kids play and chatter, Token is pushing Nichole on a swing, then he tickles Nichole and she giggles. Cartman is rather pleased with how things are progressing between Token and Nichole
Cartman
Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. [behind him, on the merry-go-round, are Stan, Kenny, and Butters. Stan and Kenny are playing with a ball.]
Stan
Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
Cartman
I don't know, it's just so... perfect. [Stan and Kenny resume playing]
Kyle
You motherfucker! [runs into view and punches Cartman, who falls on his face]
Cartman
Kyle, Jesus Christ!
Kyle
What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
Cartman
Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
Kyle
The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
Cartman
Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
Kyle
Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
Cartman
Oh! Oh, I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez? [points to a Hispanic couple riding play elephants] Is it a coincidence they ended up together?!
Stan
Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
Cartman
Oh did they? I hadn't heard about that.
Cupid Me
[reappears, and Cartman smiles at him] Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric?
Cartman
Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
Nothing.
Kyle
Who is Cupid Me?!
Cartman
Nobody.
Kyle
You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
Cartman
Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are! [can't fault him there. Nichole giggles again. Kyle looks defeated] Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
Kyle
Goddamnit! [walks away angrily]
Nichole's house, night. Inside, she and her parents are eating dinner: turkey, mashed potatoes, veggies. Nichole begins to fiddle with her food and look at the ceiling dreamily.
Dad
[clears his throat] Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school.
Nichole
His name is Token. He's really nice.
Dad
Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.
Nichole
So?
Dad
Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person.
Mom
Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person.
William
I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying... she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there! People turning their heads and saying, "Oh, look at the two black people together. That figures!"
Nichole
It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence.
Mom
And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey.
William
Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it.
Cartman's house, night. He's pounding on the bathroom door.
Cartman
Come on! [pounds on the door some more] Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry it up in there?! [pounds on the door some more. The door opens and Cupid Me floats out]
Cupid Me
Teeheeheehee, teehee.
Cartman
Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
Cupid Me
[giggles] Sorry. [Cartman goes in]
Cartman
That's- Oh, oh, Cupid Me! [covers his nose with his bath robe] Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
Cupid Me
Teeheeheeheeheehee.
Cartman
Dude, at least flush the toilet! [walks over to it] Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
Cupid Me
They're fudgey charms of sunshine.
Cartman
You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! [tries to catch Cupid Me, but Cupid Me keeps away]
Cupid Me
Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee. [flits here and there]
Cartman
I'm gonna get you! [chases Cupid Me out of the bathroom]
Cupid Me
Teeheehee, no! [flits on down the hall]
Cartman
I almost got you! Almost! [Liane walks out of her room with clean laundry, and there's no sign of Cupid Me]
Liane
[sees Cartman dancing around] Everything okay, sweetie?
Cartman
Everything's great, Mom. [to the invisible Cupid Me] No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! [dances away]
Nichole's room, evening. She checks out the teddy bear she thinks she got from Token. She reads the tag: "To My Boo." She turns the tag over and reads it, her smile vanishing: "'Cuz Blacks Belong Together"
Nichole
Oh no...
South Park Elementary, next day. Token is at his locker in the hallway, and Nichole approaches him. Token closes his locker door, not noticing her coming.
Nichole
[sad] Hey Token.
Token
[smiles and turns around] Hey Nichole.
Nichole
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Token
Sure! [she takes him to the same drinking fountain Kyle took Jenny and Lola to earlier] What's up?
Nichole
Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out.
Token
Oh.
Nichole
I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?
Token
Okay...
Nichole
I think you're really great... W-w-we just...
Token
I think... you're really great.
Nichole
...I'm sorry.
Token
Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. [turns and walks away sadly]
Nichole
Okay. [she turns towards the drinking fountain]
Cartman's room, that afternoon. Cartman is devastated.
Cartman
[crying inconsolably, sometimes sneezing into a tissue] It's not fair! They were so... happy!
Butters
[holding Cartman's right hand] It's gonna be okay, Eric.
Cartman
It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
Butters
They'll find love somewhere else.
Cartman
No, they won't!
Butters
Yes, they will.
Cartman
No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
Cupid Me
[pops out again] Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.
Cartman
And you! I should have never believed in you!
Butters
In... In who, Eric?
Cartman
[grabs the imaginary cupid] I never wanna see you again! [hurls it into his closet door. It flies low. Cartman gets out of bed, grabs a bat that's conveniently leaning against his bedroom door, and bashes the cupid over and over] Take! Your sunshine! And fuckin'! Die! [puts the bat up against the door and crawls back into bed. Butters takes Cartman's hand again and Cartman resumes crying]
The park, late afternoon. Token is sitting alone on the park bench. Kyle walks by and notices him there. A few seconds later, he walks up.
Kyle
Hey man. You okay?
Token
Yeah.
Kyle
[sits next to him] What happened? It just didn't work out?
Token
Yeah, I guess.
Kyle
So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... It's done?
Token
[long sigh] Yeah.
Kyle
[scratches his head behind the ear] So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
Token
Yeah, we're through.
Kyle
Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
Token
[getting the wrong idea] I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls. [gets off the bench and walks away]
Kyle
Huh? [suddenly remembers] Dude, what the fuck?
Cartmans house, afternoon. Cartman is in the living room watching TV in the dark, wrapped in a blanket and eating chocolate fudge ice cream.
Announcer
We'll be back with more of the Jeffersons right after this.
Commercial. A businessman finishes his work day.
Man
[leaves his office] I work hard, so I need a laxative that works hard too! [walks off. Next he's on the ground floor] I can't be constipated on the job. [stops and holds up a box] That's why I need... Soft Serve. [at a tennis court. He serves] Because when I'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough. [Cartman's interest is aroused. In the commercial the man is heading for the restroom. Another businessman comes out and the first one stops him] Don't give up. Get back in there and get to work! [now trying to poop in the toilet] 'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!
Cartman
That's right... That's right! [runs up to his room, goes into his closet and digs through his stuff until he finds the shoe box he put Cupid Me into after whacking him almost to death. He takes off the lid] Ohhh. [Cupid Me is shown laying face down battered and bruised, with a dry blood stream still near his mouth] I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
Cupid Me
No, you don't.
Cartman
Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
Cupid Me
No, you don't. [opens its right eye for a second]
Cartman
Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. [tickles the cupid]
Cupid Me
Teehee, stop it.
Cartman
Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
Cupid Me
Teeheehee, teeheeheehee, [flies out of the box] teeheeheeheeheeheeheeheehee.
Nichole's house, day. Cartman pounds on her door, and her father William answers.
Cartman
Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
William
I'm sorry, but she's at the Denver Nuggets game.
Cartman
Denver Nuggets game?
William
Yeah, she went with a nice white, Jewish boy.
Cartman
[dolly zoom] NOOOOOOO! [runs away quickly]
The Pepsi Center, around 7 pm. The bleachers are filled with cheering fans waiting for the game to begin.
Announcer
Welcome to today's matchup between the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Clippers. [the starting five from both teams take the court. A vendor hands Kyle two drinks, one of which he gives to Nichole. They look at each other fondly and take sips from their sodas.] And now, here to sing the National Anthem, country music star Brad Paisley. [he stands at center court and waves as a spotlight shines on him]
Brad Paisley
O! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars-

As Brad sings, Kyle and Nichole look at each other and smile, then look at Brad. Nichole notices someone clear across the center. It's Token, with Craig and Clyde. Token still has a heavy heart, keeping his eyes focused on the floor while Craig and Clyde smile. Kyle looks at Nichole, who's still surprised to see Token there, and grins at her. She looks back at Kyle and smiles. Outside, a tour bus drops Cartman off near the center and Cartman runs for it.
Dialog
Cartman
Nooooooo!
Inside.
Announcer
Nuggets fans, please direct your attention to center court and the president of Halitosis Kidz. [she's shown on the MegaTron waving to the spectators behind four men who are holding a Halitosis Kidz banner], who invites you to join the Denver Nuggets in the fight against morbid halitosis in children. [POV change from MegaTron to center court] Here to attempt a three-point shot for adolescents with terminally bad breath is [two of the men leave with the banner and an obese girl steps forward] the poster child for Halitosis Kidz, Stacy Muleburg. [the two other men cover their noses with their Denver team jackets as one of them hands Stacy the ball. She rushes up and throws the ball, but it's a brick] And a good try. [the two Denver men, two cameramen, the announcer, and the HK president all gather round her]
Stacy
Aaahahahaaaa.
Adults
Awww! [they all back away as fast as they can. The spectators clap for the effort. Kyle and Nichole clap as well]
Cartman
[running into the center] NOOOOOOO! [triggers an alarm]
Guard
Tickets please.
Cartman
No time! NOOOOOOO!
Announcer
We're all set for the tipoff. [The ball is thrown into the air and a Clipper tips the ball. A Nugget - Arron Afflalo - grabs it and the game begins. Afflalo throws it to JaVale McGee for an alley-oop, and McGee makes the first shot. The crowd cheers]
Cartman
Attention! Attention please! [Kyle and Nichole are surprised to hear his voice. Cartman is on the MegaTron] This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it! [Token is surprised to see Cartman there too, but Craig and Clyde are unfazed] Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands! [Nichole begins to take this in] Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. [Kyle is getting pissed off]
Crowd
Awwwww. [everyone looks at Kyle]
Cartman
I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars and the sky
[Cartman and Kyle are paired on the MegaTron and the lovecam is activated - a heart appears over their images, Cartman on the left, Kyle on the right]
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear [Crowd: "Awwww." Kyle tries to push it all away] like the shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse [Brad appears: "better or worse"], till death do us part [Brad: "death do us part"]
I'll love you with [Cartman and Brad] every gay beat of my heart!

End of Cartman Finds Love

Sarcastaball
Invesco Field, Denver, Colorado, night. A Goodyear blimp hovers over the packed stadium. The broncos face off against another team.
Dan
[describing the action on the field] Artonius Jackson catches the ball [Jackson makes his way around a group of players], he's running down the sideline- [Jackson gets tackled to the ground by #48] Ohhhh!
the Marsh house. Randy, drinking some Smores beer, has the fourth graders over so they can study the game.
Randy
BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
Dan
Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up. [once he's up, he dusts himself off.]
Randy
That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
Commentator
Yeah, Jackson took a real shot and... [Jackson dusts himself off and turns around] well I'm not sure what he's doing now, but uh, it appears as if he's looking for his keys, Dan.
Dan
Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license.
Commentator
Coach Martin is coming over to tell him that now, but Jackson appears to think he's in a car driving home. [the coach tries to get his attention]
Dan
Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that?
Goodell
Well, there certainly are interesting statistics coming out, Dan, and we are deeply concerned, anduh and waiting to see if there's... really any direct correlation between football and head trauma.
Dan
Oh, and it looks like some of the MFL alumni are takin' the field now. There's All-Pro safety Martin Gregors [fat, but the most lucid of the alumni. He stops and waves to the crowd], and fullback Jim Harris. Looks like his pants are down around his ankles. [Harris stops and waves]
Commentator
Somebody should let him know. Oh, and Old Surehand Mike Tafthill [a black alumnus who's stooped and walking slowly holding an imaginary tray], who seems to be baking an imaginary cake, Dan.
Dan
Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something.
Butters
Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
Stan
You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
Butters
That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
Cartman
That's right, Butters.
Dan
And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos
Randy
All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
Kyle
We don't have kickoffs anymore. [only the TV is heard for a few seconds]
Randy
[looks at Kyle] Huh?
Stan
The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
Randy
[stands up as his eyes widen to saucers] Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
South Park Elementary, night. The parents and teachers are gathered in the library for a PTA meeting
Principal Victoria
[flanked by Mr. Adler and Mr. Mackey] Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?
Randy
Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?
Mr. Mackey
Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?
Randy
[becoming sarcastic] Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
Mr. Adler
Bras?
Randy
Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! [other parents look at each other and whisper amongst themselves]
Linda
How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
Randy
Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
Mr. Mackey
Huh. You you think the students would like that?
Randy
Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it "sarcastaball"?!
Mr. Mackey
Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?
Randy
[angry that no one is with him on this - that is, that no one has caught on to his sarcasm] Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
South Park Elementary football field, day. And lo and behold, there's Randy as the coach, not something he was hoping for last night. Eleven boys are present, with Butters leading one team and Cartman the other. Butters does the kickoff to Cartman's team, and DogPoo catches it. The opposing players now hug each other. Stan and Kyle hug, and Stan looks at Randy
Stan
Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
Randy
Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. [thumbs up]
Butters
I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
Randy
Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
Butters
Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh, [passing Clyde and Kevin] you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
Principal Victoria
[walks up to Randy] How's it going, coach?
Randy
How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
Principal Victoria
So you're happy with these changes?
Randy
Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
Principal Victoria
[surveys the situation and decides to leave] Okay. [The boys are still hugging each other and Randy blows his whistle]
News 4 Special Report
Anchor
Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says "No," and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds.
A rally at the park. Randy continues being sarcastic, but no one catches on.
Randy
Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball! [the crowd waits a second, then applauds] Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide! [the crowd applauds and cheers] Go on, pat yourselves on the back! [and so the crowd members turn and pat each other on the back]
Anchor
Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington.
Randy
[addressing Congress] Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! [Congress applauds. The President and his wife are present, and clap with Congress.]
South Park Elementary, boys' locker room. The team is suiting up, with bras and tinfoil hats the last items to go on. DogPoo walks in
Kyle
[removes his bra and throws it to the floor] This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
Clyde
I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
Stan
This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
Cartman
Yeah, you know what? [removes his bra and throws it to the floor] Screw this!
Butters
Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing! [silence] We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
Kyle
We don't even understand how this game is played.
Butters
This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met! [walks up to Token] Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know. [walks up to Clyde] And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
Cartman
That's true.
Butters
Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us? [stands on a bench] Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
Clyde, Kenny
Yeah.
Butters
And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say "Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!" And then you give them a smile!
Boys
Yeah!
Butters
And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
Boys
[jumping up and down] Yeah! Yeah!
Cartman
[puts his bra back on] Let's do this. [turns his back towards Stan] Stan, hook up my bra.
NFL press conference. Roger Goodell is at the podium
Goodell
As commissioner of the NFL, I am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football. Oh, but why stop there? Since football is so barbaric, we should change too. So let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the Denver Broncos, Randy Marsh. [Randy gets applause from the audience as he rises. Goodell shakes Randy's hand] Congratulations, Marsh. Good job!
Randy
Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
Goodell
Nice going!
Randy
Yeah, no, you nice going! [they're still shaking hands]
Photographer

Fan 1

South Park Elementary hallway, day. The boys are walking to class. Kenny's not around, and Clyde and Craig join them
Kyle
Dude, what do you mean "We don't have a coach."?
Stan
Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
Kyle
But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
Stan
[stops and faces his friends] I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
Clyde
Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. [looks down at the floor]
Kyle
We can't.
Clyde
[somewhat cross] We don't have a coach, Kyle.
Cartman
Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
Butters
Huh?
Craig
Hey yeah.
Stan
[walks up to Butters] The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
Butters
Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
Cartman
Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
Butters
Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
Stan
Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
Butters
'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. [sticks out his tongue a bit]
Kyle
[steps in] We need you, Butters. You're the man! [Butters begins to feel the anticipation]
Butters' bedroom, night. He's in bed asleep, and a dream sequence begins. He's first hoisted up by his teammate and tossed up in the air...
The Team
Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters!
Next he's driving a new red sports car down the street and a crowd of fangirls call out to him as he passes by.
Fangirls
Butters, rah, Butters!
A Fangirl
I love you, Butters!
Butters
[stops his car and looks at the girls] I love you too, ladies. [blows them a kiss]
Next he's at an ice cream parlor with Wendy, in a booth with access from both ends.
Wendy
[to Butters' left] Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams.
Red
[slides in to Butters' right] Leave him alone, Wendy! He's mine! [they each take a cheek and plant a big kiss on him.]
Butters
Woohoohoohoohoo!
all the excitement in his dreams wakes him up
Butters
Wuh wuuuhhh wuh! [sits up] Wha? Wha? Oh. [smiles, Then looks under the covers] Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again. [the door opens and Stephen steps in] More of my creamy goo came out. [Stephen sits on the bed]
Stephen
Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night.
Butters
[excitedly] I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
Stephen
All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it.
Butters
Okay Dad! [Stephen gets up and walks out, and Butters opens up the top drawer of his night stand. He pulls out a small bottle, gets comfortable again, and collects up all the cream] Oh! Saaave that, for later. [puts a cap on the bottle]
Invesco Field, Denver, Colorado, night. It's game time, and the Broncos face the Steelers... in sarcastaball uniforms
Announcer
The score is zero to zero as the Steelers kick off to the Broncos.
Cheerleader 1
Go Broncos, Go.
Dan
Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in. [the ref blows his whistle and raises his arms] Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety!
Randy
[clapping slowly] Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!
Dan
They're gonna have to sort this one out with a side judge. [the judge looks at the replay monitor, then looks at the field]
Side Judge
Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal!
Randy
YEAH! [pumps his fist] YEAH! WOO!
Post-game conference. The press is there taking pictures of Randy as he enters the room. Randy stops and grins at everyone
Reporter 1
Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner.
Randy
Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. [covers his chest with his hands]
Reporter 1
Coach Belichick says, [reads from a small notepad] "No way we can beat the Broncos. They've had the same coach for almost a day."
Randy
Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!
Reporter 2
Guess we'll find out on Sunday.
Randy
...Yeah... [the press leaves and Randy begins to think about next week]
The Broncos' locker room. While the players change into street clothes, Randy enters the room
Randy
All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.
Broncos
D'awwwww!
Manning
Practice on Monday after a victory? Great!
Randy
That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
Manning
Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do!
Randy
That's IT! [claps approvingly]
Butters' house, afternoon. His doorbell rings and he answers
Cartman
Hey Butters, you got a minute?
Butters
Wuh sure, Eric. [Cartman walks in and Butters closes the door]
Cartman
I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
Butters
Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
Cartman
No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
Butters
Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
Cartman
...I don't have a dad.
Butters
...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out. [remembers looking at his groin and saying "Oh jeez, there's a lot this time."] But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
Cartman
Youuu save it all?
Butters' room, moments later. Butters opens up one of the sliding doors to his closet
Butters
My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. [before them is a wall of semen samples that Butters has been collecting for over a year now. Another shot shows that he's going on two years' worth of semen, with shelves of it on the other two walls]
Cartman
Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
Butters
I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. [Cartman takes a bottle and chugs it down, then analyzes the flavor]
Cartman
Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
Butters
Do you feel warm and compassionate?
Cartman
[analyzes some more...] Holy shit I think I do.
Rome, on CBS Sports Network. Jim Rome appears with his fingers forming a steeple, and with a standalone TV monitor to his left. A balloon appears, with SARCASTABALL shown above it
Jim Rome
Welcome back to Rome. We're gonna talk some sarcastaball. I can't wait. I can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling. [Randy Marsh appears on the monitor via satellite from his den] Joining me now is the coach of the Denver Broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball, Randy Marsh. Thanks for calling in, Randy. Really happy to have you on the show.
Randy
Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
Jim Rome
Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go.
Randy
Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
Jim Rome
Well it certainly makes for an exciting game. How about last night's nail-biter that ended zero to zero? That's a game I wanna watch twice. That's a game I wanna watch four times. Check that: I'll watch that game... five times. [POV switch to Randy's den] Good luck on Sunday. I'm sure that'll be another game that I could watch... twelve times. Check that: thirteen times.
Randy
Thanks Jim. [closes the satellite link and switches to a window about sarcastaball strategies and starts working on them. Sharon walks in]
Sharon
Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?
Randy
Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
Sharon
Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?
Randy
Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
Sharon
I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
Randy
Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
Sharon
Do you mean that?
Randy
Yes! I totally mean it! [breaks down and begins to tear up] Help me, Sharon. Help me.
Football night at South Park Elementary. The South Park Cows are playing North Park. South Park throws off and the two teams go at each other for hugs.
Butters
All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. [Cartman approaches North Park's #7 and knocks him down. A referee sees this, blows his whistle and walks over to the two players]
Spectators
Awwwwww!
Stan
Cartman, you idiot!
Butters
Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up! [the team huddles - er, cuddles up and Butters continues.] Now what is goin' on out there?
Cartman
That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
Clyde
Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.
Butters
Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. [Butters passes bottles of his semen around to the other boys, and they all drink the bottles down]
A hospital, day. Randy is in for a CT scan. He's on the tray and slowly goes in head first. His head is scanned and he's soon rolled out of the scanner. Results come in and are posted on an easel in a doctor's office for the doctor to peruse.
Doctor
Uh hum. Mmm. [turns towards Randy and Sharon] I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage.
Randy
[dejected] Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.
Sharon
How do we fix this, doctor?
Doctor
You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain.
Randy
So that's it. [gets up and walks around] I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! [points to the doctor]
Doctor
Ohh, rreally? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball? [gets into a thinking mode] Really? [rolls his eyes] That's fascinating. Please, go on.
Randy
No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
Doctor
You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains.
Randy
My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
Doctor
Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say "Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain."
Randy
Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! [turns left and leaves, and Sharon is thoroughly confused. She looks around]
A commercial
Jim Rome
Jim Rome here. Hey, I love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's so thrilling I need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game. That's when I reach for a bottle of this. [holds up a small bottle, now in mass production] Butters' Creamy Goo. [the commercial follows]
Voice-Over
[#18 runs with the balloon] You play hard. You need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost. [a split screen appears, with windows for football, basketball, women's soccer, and hockey] Sports these days are all about being nice, so take your game to the next level [#18 opens up a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo and drinks it]. With Butters' Creamy Goo. [a cyclist opens a bottle and drinks it. Some of it splatters on his face] You'll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine. [a round window expands and Butters pops in through it]
Butters
Like me!
Jim Rome
Get with it, and get the Goo!
Voice-Over
Butters' Creamy Goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs. Commitment! Compassion! And Comradery! And now it's available in quart size!
#12
When I get hot and tired, only one thing can boost my compassion. [drinks it down and keeps it there with some effort. A goo mustache stays on his upper lip] Now I'm back in the game! [Two players carry a bucket of goo and dump it on their coach.]
Singer
Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!
Voice-Over
[an open bottle of it falls right side up to the grass and some goo spills out] Best served just above room temperature.
A night game, with South Park against another team
Butters
42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT! [Cartman tosses the balloon back at him, and the players move forward. Butters backs up for a pass and throws the balloon up. The other team's player, #9, is ready] Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it! [#9 catches it and grins] Good job, kid! [an SUV rools onto the field, crushing #9 before it stops. The balloon bounces away unscathed. Randy is shown driving the SUV, with Sharon in tow]
Randy
STAN?! Stan! [the players break their hugs and look at Randy]
Stan
Dad?
Randy
[runs with Sharon towards him] Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!
Stan
What?
Sharon
We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.
Mr. Mackey
Hey, get off the field! M'kay?! [Randy walks to the sideline to address the crowd]
Randy
Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe. [a lot of fans have bought bottles of Butters' Creamy Goo] Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh! [gets a headache] Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again. [clears his throat again] Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would- [stomps his right foot in anger] God damn it!
Sharon
Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!
Stan
Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
Randy
Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
Sharon
Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
Stan
Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
Sharon
[stunned at the sarcasm coming from Stan] Ohohh Randy, it's happening! [cries and turns towards Randy for a hug, which he gives]
Butters
[walks up and stands next to Stan] Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
Randy
Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
Stan
We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he's being completely sincere?
Randy
I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
Cartman
That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
Stan
Yeah Dad. You need some of this. [walks forward and gives him a small bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo. Randy takes it and opens it, looking at the contents, then drinks it]
Randy
...[deadpans] This is cum. [everyone's jaws drop]
Butters' room, night. Stephen and Linda are in the room, and just outside are Sheila, Randy, Stuart, and Liane.
Stephen
And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done! [Butters is on his bed, looking chastened] Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to "Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?"! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!
Butters
What's sarcasm and what's cum?
Stephen
We'll talk about that when you're older!
Randy
Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. [all the adults leave, with Stephen closing the door behind him. Butters sighs, then gets under his covers for the night. As he drifts off to sleep, we get this voice-over]
Jim Rome
Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but "So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you." Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days.
Butters
[wakes up and gasps] DAD! Hey Dad!
Stephen
[walks in] What?!
Butters
My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
Stephen
Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend.
Butters
Thanks, Dad.
End of Sarcastaball

Raising the Bar
Wall-Mart, night. The boys are in the sporting goods section if the store. Kenny looks at bats while Cartman looks at gloves. Stan and Kyle look at other things across the aisle.
Stan
You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?
Cartman
[looks over his left shoulder] Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? [looks at the gloves again]
Kyle
Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
Cartman
[turns left to address Kyle] I'm not fat, Kyle.
Kyle
Right, you're not fat.
Cartman
Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like [that] bitch! [they see a scooter rolls past them with an obese man on it]
Stan
Whoa duude!
Kyle
Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? [another obese man rolls up behind them]
Obese Man
Excuse me. [They just look up at him] Excuse me! [they part the aisle for him - Stan, Cartman and Kenny take the side with the gloves on it, Kyle takes the other side,]
Cartman
See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
Kyle
Why do they even allow those things in stored?
Stan
They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. [Indeed, a small fleet of them are available for rent, at $19.99 each. They're labeled as electric wheelchairs. Obese people are in line as one after another of them rents a Rascal. The boys turn a corner to have a look at the Rascals as they're being rented]
Kyle
You've gotta be kidding me!
Cartman
[eyes some Oreos and goes for them] Oh my God you guys, look at this! [grabs a box and reads it] Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling. [closes his eyes and looks up joyfully] Holy hell yes!
Kyle
Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all?? [an obese man and an obese woman squeeze past each other in an aisle on their scooters.] That's YOU one day, fatass![Stan and Kenny leave] Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! [turns and follows Stan and Kenny away. Cartman is left alone with the Oreos and his thoughts]
Obese Lady
[rolls up in her Rascal] Are those Candy Corn Oreos?
Cartman
Yeah... Yeah, here you go. [walks over, tosses them into her basket, and walks away with his head down]
Cartman walks through town. He stops by a large window to look at himself, then walks on. Later he shows up at Kyle's house, and Kyle answers the door
Cartman
Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
Kyle
Why? [his eyebrows move to odd positions every so often]
Cartman
[walks in] I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart. [stops] You're right Kyle. I'm fat. [sighs] All these years you tell me and me saying "No, I'm big-boned" or "no, that's just muscle"... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
Kyle
Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
Cartman
[turns around] No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it. [walks out of the house. Kyle is puzzled. Moments later, Cartman returns on a Rascal and rolls on into Kyle's living room] Sweeeeeeeeeet!
Kyle
[angrily]Oh no!
Cartman
Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. [begins to ride in a circle around Kyle]
Kyle
You don't need that! Get off of it.
Cartman
[stops] Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. [rides away]
Kyle
That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
Cartman
[reaches the restroom and tries to get it, but the base is too wide] Hmm. [tries again. Kyle catches up] I can't. [tries again] I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. [tries again]
Kyle
What??
Cartman
Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle. [tries again] You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. [tries again]
Kyle
So take a shit somewhere else!
Cartman
That's not the way this country works, Kyle. [tries again] Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter. [tries again] It's the law.
Gerald
[arrives] What's going on down here?
Cartman
[tries again] Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible. [tries again] I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit. [backs out and prepares to leave] Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. [rolls away. Kyle looks on angrily]
Cartman rides through town looking self-satisfied while music plays in the background
Cartman
["Nobody understands how embarrassing it is to live with obesity." He rides past a couple] Out of the way. Out of the way please. ["Wherever you go, you're treated differently" He arrives at a Denny's]
Greeter
Uhh I guess take that big booth by the window. [Cartman goes towards the booth and grins]
South Park Elementary, day. Cartman's soliloquy continues. "You're made to feel different. To feel like less of a person." While the boys are in the gym tossing basketballs at each other, Cartman rides around in the hall outside, grinning all the while. Next, Cartman holds up traffic while riding his Rascal. "I feel so much shame, all I can do is try to make myself feel a little better by flying to Disneyland on the weekend."
Ticket Teller
Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh...
Cartman
Coming through. Oh how humiliating. [now at the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland: "But even at Disneyland I get reminded of my weight." He rolls into the short line] Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel. [reaches the front of the line] Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have- [finds a line of other scooter riders in front of him] Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
Legless Boy
I don't have legs.
Cartman
Yeah, well you got skinny arms! [Later on, Cartman rolls through Cnderella's Castle. "And then even Disneyland can't take away the shame, as all the people suffering from obesity are ignored. Like, we're invisible." A woman's baby carriage gets in the way and she quickly pulls it back as Cartman rolls towards the exits] 'Scuse me. Move it.
A courtroom, day. Cartman has been explaining things to the judge at the witness stand... on his Rascal.
Cartman
And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy? [chokes up and begins to sob] At Besty Buy I'm sorry. [At the defense table sits a Best Buy employee, looking around] To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom? [reaches for a long-handled grip with his left hand, then uses it to take a tissue from the judge's bench. He grabs the tissue with his right hand and lowers the grip, then blows his nose] Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
News 4 segment.
Anchor
More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping.
Obese Man 2
[being jostled in his Rascal by a group of boys] Stop it you kids! sto- Oop- Owww.[the boys succeed in tipping him over and the man is on his side unable to get up. The kids laugh and scatter, and the man begins to sound like a pig] Weak! Weak!
Anchor
The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device. [The device is shown, and it resembles a telescoping cane]
South Park Elementary gymnasium, day. Two workers are installing the tip assist device on Cartman's Rascal. Cartman is on his Rascal, and they're both on their sides. When the workers finish, he activates the device, which rights him up
Cartman
Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. [facing him is the rest of the fourth grade class]
Kyle
You have got to be kidding me!
Cartman
What, Kyle?! [the device then collapses and puts itself away]
Kyle
We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
Cartman
[rolls up to him] You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
Kyle
So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
Cartman
Oh! Oh, did you hear him?! [rolls back to the workers] This is exactly what Adele is talking about! [begins to pace back and forth] Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle! [rolls up to Kyle] Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day [rolls away] to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers! [rolls back up to Kyle] You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look! [rolls to the far end of the gum] I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
Kyle
Who's Honey Boo Boo?
Stan
Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?
A trophy room. Honey Boo Boo is showing off her trophies from the various beauty pageants she's won
Honey Boo Boo
My name's Honey Boo Boo and I'm a beauty queen, bitches. [at a pageant, onstage, dressed to win] I'm fat as a whale and I don't give two shits, girl!
Mama
Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew.
Honey Boo Boo
[back in her trophy room] I'm only six and I've already had three heart attacks, girlfriend!
Mama
[at a pageant, performs some chest compressions on Honey] Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo! [Honey Boo Boo comes to] Now get up and wave to them judges! [later on, to the camera] We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy. [Stan and Kyle are watching the show in Stan's living room. Kyle gets up and walks off]
Kyle
Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
Stan
Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
At sea, day, there's the U.S.S. James Cameron, with James Cameron on the bridge
James Cameron
This is it! Throttle down!
A crewman
[voice only] Throttle down! [Cameron leaves the bridge and goes on deck, putting on a diving suit]
Crewman 1
Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie?
James Cameron
I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!
Crewman 1
The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron.
James Cameron
Then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters? [points at him] How do YOU account for... Honey Boo Boo? The bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom. If anyone can go down there and raise it back, it's ME. [puts on some gloves and gets into a bathysphere. He closes the hatch and locks himself in] Let her go! [two workers pull down the release switches in unison. The crane releases the bathysphere and... it hits the deck below. It rolls to one side towards the edge and then drops off. Under the water, as it sinks, Cameron gets to work] UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on.
Singers
His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron.

James Cameron
Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?
Singers
James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea
Crewman 1
Yes, James, we hear the song.
James Cameron
Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low.
Singers
With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.
South Park Elementary, day, hallway. The fourth grade boys need to use the restroom. Kyle is pounding at the door, which has been locked from inside
Kyle
Come on, hurry it up in there! [inside, a toilet and the two urinals have been removed to make room for the wheelchair-accessible toilet. Cartman rolls up the ramp to get to the toilet]
Cartman
Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. [gets off the Rascal]
Kyle
[starting to fume, steps away from the crowd] This has gone far enough! [the other boys turn to look at him] How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
Token
Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.
Kyle
Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
Token
Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.
Kyle
Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
Token
[walks up to Kyle] At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.
Kyle
You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.
Token
Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.
Kyle
Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! [walks away smiling. Token watches him leave, then walks off in the opposite direction. The rest of the boys go back to waiting at the restroom door. Craig watches Kyle leave, then notices Token and follows him]
Craig
Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.
Token
He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. [hurries away]
University of Colorado at Boulder. Kyle is there to present his video on obesity. He's onstage before a large audience
Kyle
Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. [clicks on a remote to turn down the lights]
"Token Blaaaaack Productions." Token Black Prod. Presents... a montage.
Token
[voice over. Cartman is shown rolling down the street] He's chubby, [Cartman is shown at a table with lots of courses for him to go through] he's filthy [Cartman belches], and he's just a little bit nuts. [sideswipes a letter carrier and then gives him the finger] Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! ["Here Comes Fatty Doo Doo" appears onscreen with a picture of Cartman on his Rascal, with his back to the camera]
Kyle
Fatty Doo Doo?
What appears looks more like a television pilot than a documentary. Cartman is shown going down the street in downtown South Park, then he's crossing the street on his Rascal. A car stops before it hits him. then he's eating chips in the living room on his Rascal. "The new show by Token black & Kyle Broflovski" appears, then leaves the screen as Cartman rolls down the school hallway, followed by "title song by: Randy Newman"
Randy Newman
Kyle
What?
Cartman rolls through a line of people waiting to buy movie tickets and knocks out Nelly. Then he's back at Wall-Mart getting some other chips. Then he's on the toilet trying very hard to poop. Another shot of him pooping. The crowd begins to laugh at his antics. Next he's at the dining room table waiting for his powdered doughnut pancake surprise. Kyle looks at the audience's reaction, then at the pilot, which now shows Cartman ordering some stuff from the Wendell's drive-through menu. Then it shows Cartman making a beeline for Disneyland
Randy Newman
Nobody scoots a fatty doo like you do.
Scatty foo foo
Patty poo poo
White president, black president, I don't care.
Just scoop me up some doodoo and I'll be right there.
I. Only. Know. Five. Chords. Six-

Token's office, nicely appointed. some loud pounding is heard on the door
Dialog
Token
Come in.
Kyle
[enters and approaches the desk] What have you done?
Token
I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.
Kyle
When we said "documentary," I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
Token
Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.
Kyle
You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
Token
[hops off his chair and walks to a window] I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel. [turns around and faces Kyle] If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?
Kyle
When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
Token
But she's not black, Kyle. She's white. [a few seconds of silence] The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up. [faces the window again] Not by us, or anyone else.
The bathysphere. Cameron keeps descending
James Cameron
You guys seeing this?!
Crewman 1
Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron.
James Cameron
This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five.
Stan's house, porch. Stan sits on the steps as Kyle paces on the lawn
Kyle
I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
Stan
I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
Kyle
Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
Stan
[alarmed, gets up and walks up to Kyle] Dude! Dude, not cool!
Kyle
What?
Stan
Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
Kyle
[a bit shocked] What? Oh my God.
Stan
Yeah dude. It's really serious.
The Thompson living room. Mama talks to the camera
Mama
Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog.
In the car, day. Mama and Honey Boo Boo
Honey Boo Boo
[clapping] I'mm gettin' a piiig heaaart.
At the ranch, day.
Mama
Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl!
Honey Boo Boo
I waunt that one!
Farmer
This one here? [picks up a sow near them and shows off the sow's belly] You want this one??
Honey Boo Boo
Yeah! No wait! That pig over there gave me the evil eye! I wuant that one! I waunt [squeezes her eyes closed for a second] that one!
Farmer
This one? [picks up a sow near them and shows off the sow's belly] this one right here?? Ya waunt this one??
Honey Boo Boo
I want that one's heart! It looked at me funny!
In the operating room. Mama describes what's going on
Mama
We've been in the OR about two hours already. I just hope when she does her pageants the judges don't take away points 'cause she's got a pig heart. [looks over her shoulder] Honey Boo Boo! [no response] Honey BOO BOO!
Honey Boo Boo
What?!
Mama
What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart?
Honey Boo Boo
I'm gonna tell them "my heart is sweeter than bacon, child!" [Mama turns back to the camera and grins]
The Thompson kitchen. Mama is preparing a meal for the family
Mama
Who waunts sketti and butter? [pig noises are heard and the camera pans down to show Honey Boo Boo crawling all over the floor] She got a pig heart an' now she thinks she's a pachyderm. Show 'em your scar!
Honey Boo Boo
This is myyy scaaar 'cause I got a pig heart. My scar makes me sassy, child! [blows a kiss to the camera]
The bathysphere, deeper now than before.
James Cameron
S. S. Cameron? This is James Cameron. I am now at... 16,000 feet. You should see the cold darkness of it all. The isolation and yet awwwe of the sea's magnitude. I have now sunk deeper than any human has ever been before! [he soon encounters another man in a diving suit]
Randy Newman
We are here in the ocean depths goin' deep deep deep- [turns around and sees the bathysphere... and its pilot] Oh hey James Cameron.
James Cameron
What the fuck?!
Randy Newman
I've been divin' in the deep and I'm feelin' so cheap.

James Cameron
You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here!
Randy Newman
I don't want anyone raisin' the bar, 'cause nobody'll hire me! Deep deep deep in the ocean. Ohhh, come on. Fight me, Cameron.
James Cameron
Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell! [maneuvers the bathysphere's arms and lands a right punch on Newman, who falls away in slow motion]
Token's office, day. Kyle now has Cartman with him.
Cartman
It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
Kyle
I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
Cartman
Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer! [the lawyer appears outside the office and tries to enter, but can't. The lawyer is on his own Rascal] As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
Token
[waits a second] It actually aired last night.
Kyle
You found a network to buy it?
Token
Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.
Cartman
What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
Token
Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-
Cartman
[begins riding around] I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! [turns around and rides out of the office]
This is an outdoor event, with a wall erected behind the First Lady
Announcer
We welcome you to the First Lady's Symposium on Obesity, with your keynote speaker, Michelle Obama. [the audience applauds]
Michelle Obama
Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention. [Kyle is present, which means Cartman didn't fly alone] A conflict that illustrates without a doubt what should be our nation's number one priority. What will we do as a country? I cannot give you any easy answers. But what I can give you, is what we've all been waiting for! Honey Boo Boo versus Fatty Poo Poo! [the audience cheers loudly as the bell rings and two men pour sketti and butter onto the grass with five-gallon pots. Token is at Cartman's corner and Mama is at Honey's corner]
Cartman
[making 8's with his Rascal and itching for a fight] You're goin' down, bitch! [also in attendance are Butters, Stan, Kevin, and Craig] Nobody takes my ratings!
Token
That's good, Fatty, get pissed!
Cartman
I'm pissed!
Token
Yeah, Fatty!
Cartman
Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
Mama
[clapping] Ain't nobody can beat my Boo Boo at sketti wrestlin'! [meanwhile, Honey Boo Boo is striking poses and blowing kisses non-stop]
Michelle Obama
Let's do this! [the contestants approach each other in the center of the sketti ring as the audience cheers and applauds wildly. Cartman suddenly rushes at her and sideswipes her]
Honey Boo Boo
[falling to the ground] Ow!
Cartman looks back, then turns around and rides up to Honey Boo Boo as she gets up, then bumps her down again. The audience is disappointed at this. She gets up much faster this time and waits for Cartman to make his move. He rushes at her again, but she jumps onto him and delivers a flurry of punches at his face. Kyle walks around looking lost. Honey Boo Boo succeeds in knocking Cartman over and he's on his side. Honey delivers several kicks to Cartman's head and begins to squeal like a pig. The audience is cheering for Honey Boo Boo, and she responds by blowing kisses at it. Cartman rights himself up with the tip assist device
Cartman
I ain't done with you, bitch!
Man
Yeah! Tip assist!
The S.S. Cameron. Static fills the speakers as communication between the ship and the bathysphere is lost
Crewman 2
You think he's dead? [the first crewman wakes up]
Crewman 3
I hope so.
James Cameron
S.S. Cameron! This is James Cameron! I've found it! My God I found the bar! [the crewmen begin to stir. Soon they're all gathered at the computer monitor] Divert all power to sub systems! Two percent oxygen left! [the bethysphere rises quickly, followed by a long cable] The bar is too heavy! Aaaaagh! Come on you bitch!
Crewman 4
Well I'll be damned.
The symposium. Cartman is dragging Honey Boo Boo across the sketti by her hair, then lets go. Stan approaches Kyle, who's seated at a curb nearby
Stan
Dude, you okay? [Honey Boo Boo gets up, and Cartman turns back to strike her down again]
Kyle
I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again and looks at Cartman, and he strikes her down once again] Did it start with fat people on scooters?[Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] Or did the bar get lowered way before that? [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again]And then I started thinking, maybe it was us. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again] There's no going back, Stan. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again. Two men walk up behind Stan and Kyle, and pass by them]
Man 2
Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again. Stan notices the men]
Man 3
I don't know why we were watchin' that garbage in the first place. [Honey Boo Boo gets up again, and Cartman strikes her down again]
Kyle
[catches a hint of what the men were talking about] Huh?
Aide
[Michelle Obama looks a little faint] Ms. Obama, are you, uh, ma'am? Are you okay?
Michelle Obama
Something's wrong. This... This is all wrong! [runs into the sketti ring] Stop! Everyone! What are we doing?! How can you let this happen to your daughter?!
Mama
I don't know, I... How did I let myself go like this? What have I done??
Man 4
When did we devolve into watching fat kids sketti wrestling?
Michelle Obama
We need to realize obesity is an epidemic. But it's not a disease. From now on I'm going to dedicate this administration to FIGHTING childhood obesity! [turns to Cartman and begins punching away at him]
Cartman
[amid some ows and grunts] Oh! You fucking bitch! [Michelle Obama finally punches him off his Rascal. She picks it up over her head, then smashes it into the ground, breaking it. She then kicks Cartman in the stomach for good measure.]
Token
What the hell is going on?
Kyle
I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
The S.S. Cameron, day. The bathysphere has been retrieved and the hatch opens. James Cameron climbs out of it and comes down to the deck to meet the crewmen.
Crewman 5
Hey Cameron, we can't believe it.
James Cameron
We're done here! Set course for the set of Avatar 2
Crewman 6
Mr. Cameron. [Cameron stops] People should know. How you saved us all? How you raised the bar? How will they know what a hero you are?
James Cameron
[turns around] James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron. [turns around and walks a few feet, then turns around again] James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron. [the crew applauds him as he enters the bridge]
Singers
His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron.

End of Raising the Bar

Insecurity
The Broflovski house, night. Upstairs, Gerald and Sheila relax in bed, watching TV. Well, Gerald is, anyway, with his hands behind his head. Sheila is reading a book.
Announcer
Erectile dysfunction is a fact of life. You want to show her you love her, but you're old, and so is she. [A middle-aged man brings two cups of wine to the sofa and gives one of them to his middle-aged wife. Next, another middle-aged couple is shown in a row boat, with the husband rowing... slowly] The next time that special moment comes, don't let your sex drive fail you just because your wife looks like a shriveled prune. Fake it, with Cialis. [The Cialis logo scoots in from the right] It won't make her any harder, but it will make you not care for up to three hours. [A third couple is shown holding hands in his-and-her bathrubs on a deck... on the African savannah, with two elephants in the distance.] And then you can still have your own separate bathrub from her later on. [Gerald glances over at Sheila.]
Gerald
[Lowers his arms and leans in a bit] Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
Sheila
Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?
Gerald
[Puts his left arm around her] How about I put on the uniform?
Sheila
[Gets excited and bashful] Oh, Gerald...
Gerald
Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
Moments later, Sheila is in a negligee and puts some make up on. A knock is heard on her bedroom door and she answers it.
Sheila
Oh, hello. [Strikes a sexy pose - right arm on the door, left arm on her hip]
Gerald
UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
Sheila
Oh, dear, but I'm barely dressed.
Gerald
If you'll just... [Whips out a signature pad and presents it to her] sign right here. [Some time later, the bedroom door is closed, the lights are out, and Gerald is really delivering it to Sheila.]
Sheila
Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!
Gerald
Yeah? [Spanks her] Do you like your package, ma'am? [Unknown to them, Ike is standing at the doorway looking at them]
Sheila
Oh yes!
Gerald
Huh? [Followed by a series of grunts]
Sheila
Do it harder, UPS man!
Ike's room, morning. Ike is at his desk crying, and he bangs his head on the desk/ Ike has been drawing something. Kyle walks by and notices
Kyle
Ike, what's the matter? [Waits a few seconds, then goes in.] Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on? [Ike finishes up and hands the sheet of paper to Kyle. Kyle looks and is suddenly alarmed. Ike has drawn a stick figure of his mom with a UPS man, with big boobs for his mom and a big penis for the UPS man. Ike goes back to crying] Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
Ike
Yes! Yes!
Kyle
I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
Ike
I saw them, Kyle, I saw them!
Kyle
Oh no...
Stan's house, later. Kyle is in Stan's room, and Cartman and Kenny have joined them. Stan is at his desk, Kenny is on Stan's bed, Cartman is standing up
Kyle
You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
Stan
Dude, what happened?
Kyle
Take a look. [Whips out the sheet of paper Ike drew upon]
Stan
What's this? [Takes the sheet and looks at it.]
Kyle
Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
Stan
Whoa!
Cartman
Dude, no way!
Kyle
Yeah dude. [Out in the hall, Randy walks by with a cup of coffee, but he hears them and stops]
Stan
But are you sure they had sex, like, "sex" sex, or they actually had sex? [Randy sees a plant nearby, quickly dumps his coffee into it, and puts the cup against Stan's door]
Kyle
Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
Randy
[Barely audible] Ohhhh... [Hurries away]
Stan
Well are you gonna tell your dad?
Kyle
I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
Cartman
[Walks up to him] Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
Stan
Cartman dude, not now.
Cartman
No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? "Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight." It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. Aside from Skeeter, seven men are present. Jimbo, Randy, Stuart, and Stephen are at the bar. Mr. Tucker is at a table, while Mr. Black and Mr. Testaburger stand
Randy
Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
Jimbo
How do you tell him? "Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife." It's really none of our business.
Stuart
If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!
Stephen
How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!
Randy
Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
Mechanic
Wouldn't be the first time. [The other men face him] Hyeah, there's a price to be paid with having things convenient. Used to be... a man had to go to the store to buy himself a pitcher of milk. Hyeah, but men got lazy. They wanted that milk delivered right to the door. Only problem was, the guy deliverin' that milk end sup fuckin' your wife. Sure, you had your nice cold milk delivered right to your doorstep, but your wife was gettin' pounded out like a mallard duck. [takes his hat and heads for the entrance, then turns around] And now you got your Amazon. [puts on his hat] And the milkman's come back. [turns around] And none of ya are safe. [walks away, leaving the other men stunned]
Cartman's house, day. A Wolf Security System truck is parked out front. In the living room, a security agent lists some things Liane and Cartman would need on their house to secure it well. Liane looks through the brochure.
Security Agent
And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all.
Cartman
Oh no, really?
Liane
Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.
Cartman
Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
Liane
Ohhh...
Security Agent
Yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days.
Cartman
What-what do you mean?
Security Agent
Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows.
Cartman
Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
Security Agent
We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?
Cartman
Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
The Marsh kitchen, morning. Randy waits at the breakfast table as Sharon washes dishes.
Sharon
Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?
Randy
No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer. [The doorbell rings] I'll get it. [Rises quickly and heads for the front door]
UPS Man
[Holding two boxes] Hey there, looks like I got a couple of packagers from Amazon for ya.
Randy
[Warily] Oh, is that so?
UPS Man
If I can just get your signature right [Whips out the signature pad] there?
Randy
[Signs the pad] Sure um... Chad, is it?
UPS Man
Thad.
Randy
Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
UPS Man
Oh you know, just, tryin' to get to everyone.
Randy
Yeah I'll bet. [Gives him the pad back. Thad does a couple more things on the pad]
UPS Man
[Gives Randy the packages and walks back to his truck] Well, have a good one.
Randy
Yeah, you too, Thad. [Closes the door and walks back to the kitchen. He puts the packages down on the counter next to the sink] Hey Sharon, these came for you.
Sharon
[Smiles] Ooooo, stuff from Amazon?
Randy
Yeah, w-what are they?
Sharon
You know, to be honest, I can't remember?
Randy
[In a deeper voice] You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
Sharon
[Opens the larger box] Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy. [puts the knives back in the box and opens the smaller box] oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?
Randy
Yeah, sure, 'cause... [backs out of the kitchen] people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. [goes upstairs]
Stan's room, moments later. Randy enters the room with Stan's book.
Randy
Stan, you got something from Amazon. [looks around and doesn't see Stan] Oh. [goes to Stan's desk and drops the book off there. He notices Ike's drawing and takes it, looks closely at it and gasps, thinking the drawing is of Sharon and the UPS man] Ooohhh shit.
Cartman's house, afternoon. Cartman comes home from school and sets off the alarm upon entering
Cartman
Oh fuck. [Goes to the touchpad by the door to shut it off] Oh what's the- God damn it! [The phone rings and he goes to answer it. He puts his left index finger in his left ear to hear from the right ear better] Hello?
Wolf Security Systems, afternoon. It's a very nice office, but only one operator is there taking calls. Whenever the camera is on him, or on one of his colleagues later on, it moves around him to the left or right, never losing focus
Jeff
This is Jeff with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
Cartman
Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
Jeff
That's okay. Do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me?
Cartman
Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew. [Thinks a moment] No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
Jeff
Okay, I've got something a little different here.
Cartman
Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
Jeff
No problem.
Cartman
Sorry about this.
Jeff
It's all right, it happens all the time.
Cartman
'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean "That's all right"! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
Jeff
You want to rape your mom?
Cartman
[Liane appears at the top of the stairs and becomes coming down, but stops to hear what Eric is saying] That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
Jeff
You said you lived there.
Cartman
[His mom goes back up the stairs] I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. The mechanic is back at his table. The shadows of a group of men creep up on him
Randy
How did you get rid of him? [The mechanic looks at him] How did you get rid of the milkman?
Mechanic
There's no getting rid of him. Not in any you folks would be prepared for. Noh, best you just let him go on fucking your wives. Maybe he'll get tired of it.
Stephen
Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore! [The others look at him, he looks around] This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now.
Randy
[Puts his hands on the table] You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
Mechanic
We used a pretty blonde to lure him in. When she answered the door she told the milkman to follow her to the bathrub. She took off her clothes and... asked the milkman to fill the tub with milk. The milkman said, "You want that milk pasteurize?" And the blonde replied, "No, just up to my boobs. I can splash it in my eyes." That's when we jumped 'im. It was over in minutes. Then we burned his body. You wanna get rid of the milkman? You gotta kill him and kill him good. And then you gotta go to the store for your stuff from then on.
Cartman's house, next day. A cat burglar with cigarette is at Cartman's front door
Cat Burglar
Hey, ey uh, [Takes a puff of cigarette] you want me to do this, you gotta pay up front, kid!
Cartman
You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it? [closes and locks the door, then arms the system, then goes to the phone to wait for Wolf Home Security to call. The cat burglar pounds a window until it gives way and he goes in. The alarm goes off a second later. Cartman gets pissed off when the burglar breaks a second window and there's no response from Wolf. Finally the call comes in, and Cartman answers it] Hello?
Michael
This is Michael with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
Cartman
[The cat burglar appears as he goes towards the stairs. He then stops] Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom. [Softly, to the cat burglar while muffling the mic] Go go, she's upstairs. [The cat burglar heads up the stairs] Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
Michael
Oh-kay, should we contact the police?
Cartman
Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
Michael
Okay, we're contacting them now.
Cartman
He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
Michael
Try and stay calm, the police are on their way.
Cartman
Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out! [Looks at the phone] The fuck?!
The Stotch house. Stephen goes to the front door and opens it.
UPS Man
Hey there, misterrr Stotch. looks like another Amazon package. [Smiles]
Stephen
I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell.
UPS Man
[looks puzzled] ...Sss-sorry?
Stephen
Just let me sign. [the UPS man hands him the signature pad, Stephen signs it and gives it back and gets his package, and the UPS man leaves. Stephen opens the box and pulls out a Bane mask, still in the plastic package. Then he whips out a flip phone from his back pocket and talks into it] All right, he's coming to you.
The UPS truck, day. The UPS man gets into his truck and starts it up. A gun appears next to his face, ready to shoot shoot at him. He's startled
Voice
Well hello there, Mr. UPS man!
UPS Man
What are you-?
Randy
[wearing his own Bane mask] You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
UPS Man
[the UPS man releases the hand brake and drives off] Look, you can have whatever's in the back! Ih-ihit's all stuff from Amazon!
Randy
Oh no, pull in here.
A U-Stor-It storage facility, day. The UPS man drives into it
UPS Man
Just let me go, huh?
Randy
Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! [the driver's side door opens and the other men from the bar, also wearing Bane masks, drag the UPS man out]
UPS Man
Aaawwgh! [they take turns kicking and punching him]
Stephen
You should have never come to our town! [punches him twice, the second one sending him to Stuart]
Stuart
A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. [punches him three times, the third one sending him back to Stephen. The UPS man falls to the ground and the Banes start kicking him. A woman is heard screaming. She and her husband are shown]
Woman
Oh my God.
Man
Come on honey! [they run off]
Randy
[whips out Ike's drawing and puts it in the man's face] Thought we wouldn't find out??? [drops it and the men scatter. Skeeter and Stephen go towards the camera and away, screen left. Stuart. Randy, and Mr. Testaburger run away from the camera, and Jimbo, Thomas, and Mr. Black run off screen right. The UPS man is left alone, battered, bruised, and coughing up blood]
Cartman's house, day. Someone knocks on his door five times, then tries to jiggle the locks open.
Cartman
[stops] Who is there?
UPS Man
[opens the door and stumbles in] Please! [still gasping for air]
Cartman
Oh?! Ohhh?! [backs away quickly. The phone rings, but Cartman goes to the kitchen to answer it] Yes? Yeah, hello?
Varashnu
[with Indian Accent] Hello, this is Varashnu wit Wolf Home Security.
Cartman
A man just broke into my house and is- [looks at the phone] Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
Varashnu
...Uh yes, I am in United States.
Cartman
Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
Varashnu
Okay, hold on. [transfers Cartman's call]
Cartman
Heh- hello?
Kevin
This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
Cartman
No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
Kevin
We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones.
Cartman
Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
Kevin
Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood.
Cartman
Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
Kevin
I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head.
Cartman
Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! [slams the phone on the floor]
Park County Police Station, day. A crowd has gathered in front of the station. Sgt. Yates addresses the crowd's concerns.
Sgt. Yates
All right, quiet down people, please! Quiet! [the crowd quiets down] I know you're all worried about your families' security. All I can tell you is that so far, Bane has not been caught. [the people begin to murmur amongst themselves]
Mr. Mackey
Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay?
Gerald
And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
Randy
[aside to Gerald] Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
Gerald
What?
Randy
Huh? Nothing.
Sgt. Yates
Now listen! There's nothing more we can do to protect your homes. But there's someone here who says he can. [makes way for the security agent who visited Cartman and his mom earlier]
Security Agent
Hello folks, we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure. Now, you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows, motion detectors in the living areas, and I would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe outside the home.
Randy
Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?
Spokesman
[in a commercial] Protecting your home and your family is hard enough! But sometimes alarms on your doors and windows aren't enough! A new security system allows not only for your doors and windows to be monitored, but your fear levels as well. [a 3-D schematic of a house is shown, with a person in it] A security system that is actually inside you. It's called IN-security.
Husband
[with wife and twin daughters] We'll never forget the day we took our twin daughters to the beach.
Stranger
Hehey, what cute twins.
Wife
Thanks.
Stranger
They're so adorable [whips out a crowbar and assumes a menacing posture. The wife instinctively tries to protect the girls] that I'm gonna bash their fucking heads in! [the alarm goes off and the stranger runs away, dropping the crowbar. The husband receives the call]
Peter
This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Husband
A white man just tried to murder our twin girls.
Peter
I have a police car on their way with blankets and cocoa. [Next shot is of the whole family in blankets and sipping cocoa at the beach, with police cars around them and police officers investigating]
Husband
I only hope other have people have INsecurity to protect their families.
A shoe store. A woman is getting her son new shoes
Shoe Salesman
Well, how's the shoe fit, pal?
Boy
I think it fits pretty good.
Shoe Salesman
Well okayhehe, let's see if it fits better than this KNIFE THROUGH YOUR FUCKING SKULL, BASTARD! [gets out a large knife and slashes the air with it.]
Boy
Aaahh! [jumps into his mom's arms and the alarm goes off. The salesman drops the knife and runs off. The phone rings and the mom answers it]
Mom
Hello?
David
This is David with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Mom
[voice breaking] No, a while shoe salesman tried to murder my son.
David
Hold tight. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa. [next scene, mom and son are in blankets and sipping cocoa while the police investigate]
Spokesman
Don't let your family become another statistic. Have piece of mind with... [the new company logo appears, with "Custom installation for only $99."] INsecurity.
South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Kyle and Stan walk along to class
Kyle
It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
Stan
You're gonna have to tell him, dude.
Kyle
I know...
Cartman
[runs up to them] HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! [wears a little sign on his head showing that ]
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
Kyle
Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
Cartman
Oh, fat bitch, huh?! [gets smug] Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
Kyle
The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
Cartman
What? [his alarm goes off, then he gets the call] Hello?
Marcus
This is Marcus with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Cartman
Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
Marcus
All right, could I just get your password please?
Cartman
Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
Marcus
I love boobs?
Cartman
No, "uloveboobs." Lower-case u love boobs.
Marcus
How did you know that?
Cartman
My password is uloveboobs!
Marcus
Oh oh I get it. That's pretty funny.
Cartman
You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
Marcus
Sure, here you go. [gets to resetting the system]
Cartman
Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-! [notices Kyle is gone, but looks around] Kyle? God damn it.
Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, day. The men are back in the bar
Randy
And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
Stuart
Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.
Jimbo
[bursts through the front doors] He's back!
Stephen
What?!
Jimbo
[runs to the bar] I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!
Stephen
How?
Jimbo
He casually dropped this on his way out! [whips out a sheet of paper, and the other men gather to have a look. It's Ike's drawing]
Randy
[low voice] Oh my God! [now he and the men think the UPS man has made copies of that drawing and is dropping them off at every house]
Mechanic
Didn't kill 'im, did ya? [the other men turn around] Yea', I didn't think you had it in ya.
Randy
We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
Mechanic
Milkman don't get scared. Not with free pussy at every doorstep.
A stakeout. Someone is looking at the UPS man deliver a package through binoculars. A woman answers the door, takes her package from the UPS man, and closes the door. The UPS man looks around to make sure no one is out to hurt him any further. He goes to his truck, then checks under it to make sure it hasn't been rigged with a bomb, then he looks around once more
Stephen
Son of a bitch, it's him all right!
Randy
This guy doesn't know when to quit!
Stephen
He's stopping at another house. [the UPS man stops his truck, gets down with a new package, and goes to the next house, looking around]
Mr. Black
Guess this guy's a lot tougher than we thought. Must be why our wives want him so bad.
Randy
[his INsecurity goes off] Sorry sorry, that's me. [gets the call] Hello?
Alvin
This is Alvin with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
Randy
Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo. [the other men glance at him] It's a joke.
Kyle's house, day, living room. Kyle sits on the sofa between his parents
Kyle
Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
Sheila
That's right, Kyle.
Kyle
And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. [the doorbell rings and he sighs deeply, then goes to answer it. The UPS man is on the other side of the door]
UPS Man
Uhh, hi, I got a delivery for ya?
Kyle
Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
UPS Man
What?
Kyle
Please? I need you to come sit down for a second. [puzzled, the UPS man comes in and sits down on the armchair. Kyle returns to his spot between his parents, and silence follows for a couple of seconds] So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something? [she stays quiet] Mom?
UPS Man
What's going on?
Kyle
You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
UPS Man
Don't you think I want to?! [his UPS truck is shown in the background] I hate this damned town! Every day, things just keep getting weirder around here, and I'm just about sick of it![Randy and Stephen run out from behind the truck, and a few seconds later it blows up] Aaah! [runs to a window] Oh my God! [gets the call and answers it] Hello?
Brian
This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
UPS Man
No! They blew up my car! They blew up my car!
Brian
I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.
UPS Man
[goes up the stairs] They're after me again! Do something!
Brian
Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in. [switches calls] This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
Cartman
[in the perfume section of a store, with a saleswoman behind the counter] Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
Gerald
[opens the front door] What the hell's goin' on out here?! [Stephen and Jimbo lie in wait for the UPS man]
Jimbo
Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!
Gerald
What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! [Jimbo's INsecurity goes off, his phone rings, and he answers it]
UPS Man
[trying again to call INsecurity] Somebody answer me! You have to send help now!
Martin
Sir, we are sending help. Just stay calm. [another call comes in] Hang on sir, this is Martin with INsecurity.
Randy
[on the phone] Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.
Martin
Hello, this is Martin with INsecu-
Cartman
[outside a store] God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards![Martin is swamped with calls. Another one comes in] Hello? [his own INsecurity has gone off]
Mike
This is Mike with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
UPS Man
[in the master bedroom] Hello?!
Kyle
[sees the open door and goes in] Dude, come down here!
UPS Man
[panics] AAAAH! [jumps through the closed window to his death] Uf. [everyone else looks. Police arrive shortly with blankets and cocoa.]
Sgt. Yates
So you say this man killed himself because he was a psychopath who was forced to have sex with his mother? [holds a sheet of paper in his hand]
Stephen
Yes, we found that in his pocket. [points to the sheet, which the captain holds up. It's... Ike's drawing again]
Officer
Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs? [It's the UPS uniform Gerald uses in roleplaying]
Gerald
Yes, that's mine.
Randy
Yours? What?
Sheila
[rips the uniform from the officer] Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
Kyle
Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
Gerald
Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. [all the other men's alarms go off, their phones ring, and they all answer them]
The Men
Hello?
Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. The men return to the bar and find the mechanic at his table again
Randy
It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
Mechanic
Yea'. Got yourselves some nice home security systems, don'tcha? Payin' a man to do your job of protecting your house. Only problem is, while you're out feelin' like your things are safe, that security man is fucking your wife.
Address 10228, day. The security agent is at the house talking to a woman
Security Agent
Doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back. [the woman closes her door and the agent goes back to his van. He gets in and sits down, preparing to drive. A gun pops up next to him, and he's alarmed.] Ah! Who are you??
Cartman
[in Bane mask] It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. [the men return in Bane masks to haul the agent out and beat him up]
Security Agent
Hoo!
End of Insecurity

Going Native
South Park Elementary School Cafeteria, day. The kids are seated for lunch. At the center table are Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Token, Clyde and Craig. Cartman runs in from the hallway
Cartman
FELLAS! Fellas!
Stan
What?
Cartman
You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
Kyle
Butters? [He and Stan look puzzled] Why?
Cartman
It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
Stan
You're talking about Butters.
Cartman
Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! [The other boys get concerned and leave their tables to go to the restroom]
The restroom around the corner from the cafeteria. Jimmy has joined the boys. Stan bangs on the door
Stan
Butters?
Butters
Leave me alone!
Stan
Butters, come out here.
Butters
Get out of here, all of ya! [Stan turns to the other boys and shrugs]
Kyle
Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
Butters
[Runs out of the restroom up to Kyle and points at him] You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because [walks to Stan and points him out] your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image! [runs back inside the boys room, then turns around and runs to Cartman] You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up [moves over to Jimmy], and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny! [moves over to Kenny] The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! [Runs back into the restroom and locks himself in. The other boys are stunned and silent]
Cartman
Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? [Kenny flashes an angry look]
Butters
[Runs out of the restroom again and storms up to Cartman] And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! [Cartman looks stunned]Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! [Runs back into the boys restroom and locks himself in]
Cartman
...Wow.
Butters
[Opens the door and peeks out] Double wow! [Closes the door and locks it]
The principal's office, Day. Principal Victoria is talking to Butters and his parents.
Principal Victoria
I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.
Stephen
Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!
Butters
[In a gruff voice] I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
Linda
Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
Butters
I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
Stephen
Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!
Butters
Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! [Both parents look taken aback as a moment of silence follows]
Linda
[looks at Stephen] Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Stephen
Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.
Principal Victoria
Eh-excuse me?
Stephen
Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault.
Butters
It's not?!
Stephen
It has to do with... biology. [turns right and walks off a bit] You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.
Butters
Yeah?
Stephen
You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.
Butters
[normal voice] Hey yeah, all the time.
Stephen
It's because he is. [Turns around and faces Principal Victoria] His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place.
Principal Victoria
Ah I'm sorry, I really don't understand.
Stephen
Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing.
The Stotch house, day. Stephen and Linda argue as Butters sits on the couch
Linda
I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!
Stephen
It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!
Linda
Then we can go with him.
Stephen
You know that's not allowed!
Butters
Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
Stephen
Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.
Butters
Uhbu-but I'm from here.
Stephen
No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters. [Walks to a bookshelf and grabs a scrapbook] A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.
Butters
We're from Hawaii?
Stephen
[Sits on the sofa next to Butters. Linda sits to his left] Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive. [Opens the book and points some pictures out to him] We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King. [Flips backwards a few pages and shows him a picture of Elvis Presley playing a ukulele with a picture of Diamondhead in the background.]
Butters
But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
Stephen
Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called "hapahui apahoha", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone. [Linda stands up and starts crying. Stephen stands up and takes out his wallet] Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you. [He turns his back to Butters. Linda weeps silently. Butters is speechless]
The neighborhood park, day. The boys from the table are playing basketball, and Jimmy joins in. Kenny tosses the basketball at Kyle, who makes a shot, and Cartman runs up to them from the sidewalk. Stan catches the ball
Cartman
Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. [The other boys gather around him]
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
Stan
Hawaii?
Cartman
He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
Kyle
Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
Stan
[Turns to the basket] After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. [Makes a shot at close range]
Kyle
Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
Kenny
(I'm not his best friend.)
Cartman
Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. [Kenny sighs and walks away with his head down.]
The airport, day. Kenny arrives and walks into the Alpha Air terminal. He sees Butters seated on a seat in an empty row, with two suitcases at his feet. He's sobbing. Kenny walks over
Kenny
(Butters, come on.)
Butters
They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right! [Kenny takes one suitcase and Butters' right hand, Butters takes the other suitcase, and they walk. Suddenly Butters stops and pulls his hand away] No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! [Kenny sighs, then takes Butters to the teller]
Kenny
(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
Teller
I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated.
Butters
I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just "deligerent" because of my hapanuanalua!
Kenny
(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
Teller
Tell you what: there's plenty of points on his Mahalo Rewards card. If you wanna fly with him, I can let him go.
Kenny
(Me?)
Butters
Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
Kenny
[Puts his hand over Butters mouth to shut him up] (Okay, okay! I'll go.) [Scene cuts to the plane flying towards Hawaii]
Lihu'e Airport, Kaua'i, Runway B-5. The plane lands and Butters and Kenny enter the terminal. Butters has picked up his bags
Butters
[Slowly, as he looks around] Well, we're here, now what do I do? [Kenny points to the information officer nearby, and they walk to him]
Officer
Can I help you with anything?
Butters
Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
Officer
Okay, were you with a cruise ship or land tour group?
Butters
Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. [The officer just looks at him. A group of Americans approaches him]
Blond Man
Butters Stotch?
Butters
Yeah?
Blond Man
Welcome home, young keiki. Your parents said you would be coming for your ceremony. [Notices Kenny] Ah- uh, who's this?
Butters
Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.
Older Woman
Butters, native Hawaiians don't really approve of haoles coming to their ceremonies.
Butters
Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
Blond Man
Very well, we shall speak with the chief of our island and see. Come now. [Everyone leaves]
En route to the chief, day. They go down the road, all packed into an SUV.
Butters
You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
Older Man
[Driving] Yes. My wife Patty and I have been coming to Kaua'i for almost five years, and Bill and Donna actually own a time share in Poipu.
Donna
Yes, but Poipu is getting pretty overrun with tourists, I'm afraid.
Blond Man
[Leans to the right, behind the older man] Let us eat.
Older Man
Oh yea, let us eat. [They stop at Kuwahara Saimin's drive-through] Aloha, five order of saimin, please.
Butters
What's "saimin"?
Patty
It's one of the foods of our people.
Older Man
Oh, I get 20% off, I'm a native. Here's my Mahalo Rewards card. [The cashier notes the card and takes the cash, the older man takes the food, and they're off.] Mahalo. [They soon find themselves behind a slow car with the passenger taking pictures of the scenery. The older man honks.] Come on, you frickin' tourist! Jesus, buy a post card! [Stops and points out a building] These are the ancient ruins of our ancestors. [It's the Coco Palms, long abandoned.] They say the spirit of the king is still in there.
Blond Man
You must stay away from this place. It is kapu.
Brunet Man
Kapu. that means "taboo", [points to Kenny] especially to haoles! [they drive off]
Older Man
Uh that there is Bubba's Burgers. [Scene shows Bubba's Burgers] In Havai'i us natives say "Bubba's Bruk". [they pass by a big hotel] Here's the Sheraton, just another megahotel for the throngs of tourists. Here's where many of us natives live. The Sheraton Residences. [A gated community is shown. The Older Man flashes his Mahalo Rewards card to the guard] It's all right, we're natives. [The guard opens the gate and lets them in. They arrive at the chief's residence and step out to talk to him] Protector and Chief, I present to you the keiki, Butters Stotch.
Chief
Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole?
Kenny's room at the Residences, night. He sits by the open window with a lit candle, a pencil and a sheet of paper. He begins to write.
Kenny
My dearest friends,:I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
As he writes, the following scenes are shown: First, the Safeway supermarket. The people greet each other with a fist, with pinky and thumb extended. Next, three kids are playing in a pool while Donna enjoys her chi-chi and the older couple sit on chaise longues in the background. Next, Kenny is at the bar order a chi-chi. Next, Butters learns how to play bocce ball. Next, Stan reads the letter to Cartman and Kyle
Stan
[reading the letter] "On the morrow"? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
Kenny
To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever. Humbly yours, Kenneth.

A luau, day. All the natives are in line for lunch before the ceremony begins. Butters stands on a platform before the chief while Kenny watches on
Chief
In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa. [everyone cheers and and woman slips a necklace onto his neck] The shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island. [a horn blower comes in with a conch shell and blows into it... badly] Now drink the chi-chi! [Patty walks over with a glass of it and gives it to Butters, who begins to drink it through a straw.]
Butters
[turns right and coughs, then] Whoa, it's like gasoline!
Chief
Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away.
Butters
[Finishes the rest of the drink, then stumbles just a little bit and smiles] Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
Chief
O spirits of ancestors, we ask that you bless this native Hawaiian with his hapa noa! We ask that you-
Blond Man
[runs in] Listen! [climbs onto a table] Listen everyone! I have terrible, horrible news!
Chief
Do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa?
Blond Man
I've just come from the front office! The Mahalo Rewards card is... [chokes]
Chief
What?! What has happened? Speak!
Blond Man
The Mahalo Rewards card is being eliminated! They're trying to say our points are... are... no longer going to be accepted.
Chief
[Rises from his chair and walks to his left] I knew one day it would come to this.
Patty
To what? What does this mean?
Chief
The haoles are trying to do away with us.
Resident 1
With no rewards program, there will be no distinction between who's a native to this island and who isn't!
Resident 2
Why can't you people respect our island? Why do you always want nore?!
Chief
I'm sorry keiki, your hapa noa will have to wait! For we must unite together as never before! It is time to show the haoles that this is our island! [this draws cheers from everyone]
A seaside golf course, day. A cruise ship is some distance from the shore when it blows its horn. A group of natives stand by their golf balls
Chief
[Yelling at the ship] Stop ruining our island, haoles! FIRE! [The natives fire away into the ocean. Some of the golf balls land in the water, some of them reach the ship]
First Mate
What are they doing? [The passengers are being pelted with golf balls.]
Chief
[Walks over to Butters and gives him a club] Take a swing! Let them know they are not welcome!
Butters
I've never done this before. [Gets into position]
Chief
It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you.
Butters
Aim... my anger! Stupid [Swings successfully] Ben Affleck! [The golf ball sails through the air and enters the bridge, smashing through the window and the captain's binoculars. The first mate shrieks] Waaah! [The captain stumbles onto a controller and breaks it with sheer momentum. The ship begins to pitch back and sink. Passengers begin to tumble towards the water. Butters is dumbfounded. The ship breaks in two]
Man
Hold on! [The golf club just falls out of Butters' left hand] Hold on!
Woman
Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!
Man
I love you! I love you!
Woman
No! I love you! I love you back! [The ship vanishes below the water]
Breaking News
Announcer
This is breaking news!
Anchor
An insurrection in the Hawaiian Islands has escalated to war! After sinking a cruise ship, the natives of Kauai continue to go berserk, forcing all tourists off their island.
Man 1
They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!
Woman 1
Then a little boy called me a skank.
Anchor
[A picture of Barack Obama appears over his shoulder] The President says he will send the Coast Guard to take the island back, though he sympathizes, being a native Hawaiian himself. [Thinks about it for a second] Hm.
The ceremonial plaza, day.
Chief
Are all the tourists gone from our island?
Resident 3
All but a few who are hiding out at Duke's Restaurant. We sent Bob and Trisha Turner to smoke them out.
Resident 4
What about him?
Kenny
(What about me?)
Resident 4
He's a tourist and he knows everything! We have to kill him!
Butters
[Jumps in front of Kenny to shield him] No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
Chief
Be careful young keiki, your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony. Perhaps we should finish it now.
Resident 4
Finish his ceremony?! We are at war, David! I have lived on this island for ten years. Ten years! Every July and part of August! And I can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide!
Resident 5
He's right, David. We can't trust any tourists.
Butters
He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!
Kenny
(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)
Resident 6
Then let him prove himself! Trial by opahika'a!
Chief David
He's only a child!
Resident 4
If he wants to be one of us, then he must face the challenge!
Chief David
Very well. [The horn blower, Resident 5, returns to blow the conch shell]
On the bank of a river flowing by the Residences, day. David and Butters are there with the rest of the residents in the background, and Kenny is...
Blond Man
This isn't right! He's not a native! He's gonna get killed!
Butters
Kenny, be careful!
Chief David
Quiet. He must face this challenge alone. [Kenny is on a surfboard on the river using a small paddle to get somewhere]
Resident 1
By the gods! Perhaps he has the heart of a native after all!
Resident 4
He still has yet to make the turn! [Kenny reaches a buoy in the middle of the river and paddles around it, then makes his way back to the riverbank.]
Residents
Hohhh!
Resident 7
[A little tipsy from his drink] That's pretty good. [Kenny slows down, then loses his balance and falls into the river]
Kenny
(Whoops!)
Butters
Kenny!
Residents
Awwwww. [A second later they all turn away and leave. Butters stays at the riverbank.]
Resident 4
[To another Resident] I told you a haole couldn't do it!
Chief David
Did you make the turn your first try? Did any of us? [Kenny pops up behind them and floats down the river]
Resident 8
[A woman, walks up to Butters] Don't worry, Butters, your friend will find a way back to his kind. The gods will protect him. [She extends her left hand and guides him away]
Kenny looks downriver and sees a waterfall. He panics and quickly dog paddles away from it, but the current overwhelms him and he goes over. He bumps into several rocks, each bigger than the last, on his way down, head first
Smith's Tropical Paradise, day. David has assembled the residents into this building and now talks to them
Chief David
We have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war, all the native Hawaiian tribes must join as one!
Resident 9
We're not joining the people of the Hyatt Grand Vacations! They have no rights to call themselves natives!
Vacationer 1
Oh and you do?! Your ancestors came on an airplane six months ago! Our ancestors sailed here! On a cruise ship! Nine months ago!
Chief David
Look, if we are to fight the haoles, we have to allow all natives to stay!
Canyoner
It doesn't matter how many tribes we have, we can't win! We are but a few against the haole's military might! We may have passion, but passion does not win wars!
Chief David
Oh no? Come up here, keiki. Come on. [Butters gets on stage with David] This child sunk a cruise ship by himself! Tell them keiki. [Hands the mic to Butters]
Butters
Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
Resident 9
Yeah!
Vacationer 1
Screw them!
Butters
Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
Chief David
Let us make a pact with more chi-chis!
Resident 10
[goes to serve himself some more chi-chi from the barrels, but finds there isn't any] Um, we're... we're out of chi-chis.
Resident 11
Oh, right, we've closed off all the ports.
Resident 12
But they're still letting vodka through, right? Uh... they can't cut off our chi-chis.
Chief David
...Oh my God.
Downriver, day. Kenny crawls onto the riverbank, coughs, and looks up. He's across the road from Coco Palms. He stands up and walks towards it. He looks around and heads in, but first waits for a bunch of bats to fly out of the cavernous entrance. Meanwhile, offshore, the U.S. Coast Guard shows up in force to deal with the natives
Captain
This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!
Chief David
[heading up a large group of natives] Ready? Fire! [the natives fire off their golf balls, but none of them have any effect on the Coast Guard]
Captain
[Lowers his binoculars, then flatly] Fire. [The ships' guns fire away and decimate many of the natives]
Chief David
Arm the bocce balls! [Surviving natives arm bocce balls into slingshots stretched between palm trees. One of them lands on the main ship with a heavy thud]
Captain
God damn it.
Chief David
Keep fighting! Stand your ground!
Resident 4
We can't fight without chi-chis!
Chief David
You can and you MUST!
Butters
[He has six golf balls in front of him and he hits each one towards the Coast Guard] Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
Kenny walks through the Coco Palms, which is dark and spooky. A voice is soon heard, and Kenny stops in his tracks. He turns and runs away, but steps onto a patch covering a hole on the floor and falls in. He recovers and looks up to see the shining ghost of Elvis Presley. He beckons Kenny to follow him, mumbling just like Kenny does.
The King
Come on, come on. [Mumbles a few more things as they walk towards a door. Elvis stops and pulls a lever, and a wall rises to reveal loads of absolute vodka, pineapple juice, coconut milk, and macadamia nut liqueur, all the ingredients needed for chi-chis. Elvis walks up to the doorway and motions to Kenny] You know what chi-chis are, right?
The Residences, day, on the ceremonial plaza, Chief David admits defeat
Chief David
Listen everyone, we gave it all we had. It's over. We must go down to Nowiliwili Harbor, and surrender to the American government.
Butters
[Runs onto the plaza] Surrender?! No, the heck with that!
Resident 4
We can't hold out here any longer!
Butters
Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
Chief David
Young keiki, try to control your anger.
Butters
No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director! [Turns around and walks away] All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
Resident 13
Everyone! Look, I say! [Everyone comes to see, and it's Kenny coming back with a raft full of absolute vodka, pineapple juice, coconut milk, and macadamia nut liqueur. Everyone cheers him on]
Resident 14
The haole did it!
Kenny
My dear friends of the mainland,:What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.
Chief David
We are not surrendering today! Go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end! [Everyone cheers]
Captain
You people just don't give up, do ya?
Kenny
The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.
Everyone cheers, even the Coast Guard captain
Kenny
With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.
The hapa noa ceremony, day. Butters will finally become a full-fledged member of his tribe
Chief David
And so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa. Take your cards, boys. [Two women come up and give them their cards] Apuiloa hapnanoaha! Hapa'a'a hohaaa! [Resident 5 returns to blow the conch shell a third time.] It's finally over, young keiki. Is your anger at rest?
Butters
[He thinks for a moment] Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
Resident 15
Ben Affleck isn't with Jennifer Lopez anymore, he's married to Jennifer Gardner.
Residents
Yeah, it's true, uh huh.
Butters
What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. [smiles with relief]
Kenny
(You do?)
Butters
Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology. [He and Kenny walk off into the sunset] Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
End of Going Native

A Nightmare on Face Time
The Marsh house, day. Sharon is carving a pumpkin at the dining room table, Shelly and Stan work on making the pie filling. Randy enters the house with gifts.
Randy
[excitedly] Hellooo family! [closes the door] Who wants champagne? [puts the gifts on the sofa]
Sharon
[meeting him at the sofa] Randy, what is all this? [Stan and Shelly follow]
Randy
It's finally happened, Sharon! [makes to fists and draws them to his chest] I did it! [raises his fists up and lowers them quickly, then opens the gifts. He gives the first one to Sharon] Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.
Sharon
[happily] Oho, Randy, it's beautiful!
Randy
[proudly] And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
Stan
[gets his gift] We're rich?
Shelly
[gets her gift] Finally.
Sharon
Randy, are you being serious? [smiles]
Randy
I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! [Sharon frowns]
Stan
[somewhat confused] Blockbuster Video?
Randy
Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
On the road, day, under some ominous clouds. Randy drives him family out of town
Randy
You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
Sharon
I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
Randy
Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
Stan
Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. [they reach their destination and exit the car, and have a look at the place]
Randy
Well? There she is. [a building in the middle of a parking lot, looking nice, but silent.] It's a new beginning for us! [takes out the key to the building and goes to the front doors to open the store up. The others follow.]
Shelly
[staying by the car] I don't wanna go in there.
Randy
Shelly come on!
Blockbuster Video. The store is dark. A mouse runs past as the camera pans from left to right. Randy opens the door and they all enter. Randy flips on the switches.
Randy
Can you believe it? Completely turnkey! [walks towards the shelves while his family stays by the front doors.] Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD! [returns] Well, what do you think?
Stan
It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
Randy
Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
Sharon
I didn't say anything.
Randy
You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
FRIDAY
Randy waits behind the counter for his first customer. Sharon is reading a book, Stan is watching something on his iPad, and Shelly is sorting the DVDs out.
Randy
How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
Shelly
Six. [picks up another DVD from a stack] We still, have, SIX. [turns and puts it on a shelf with more copies of the DVD]
Randy
Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
SATURDAY
There's still no business at the store. A red rubber ball bounces towards the front door
Boy
Go get it, Fillmore! [the boys are on a low cliff across the street.]
Fillmore
No way, I ain't goin' neer that place. Yeeeyou go get it. [they panic as the front door opens. Randy picks up the ball and sees them]
Randy
Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
Boy
What's he talkin' about rentin' a divadee?
Randy
[annoyed] Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore! [raises his arms as if to grab something] People just don't know we're open yet!
Fillmore and Friend
AAAAAH! [turn right and run off]
Randy
[throws the ball back across the street.] Little fucking pricks. [goes back inside and closes the door.]
TUESDAY
Randy walks through the store until he passes an aisle with a woman in it, then steps back and approaches her
Randy
Hello, welcome to Blockbuster! [the shopper looks through the TV series boxed sets] Can I help you find something?
Shopper
I can't find... [turns her head to face Randy] Turner & Hooch. [turns back to the videos] Where's Turner & Hooch?
Randy
Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
Shopper
Aahh... [her voice echoes as she dissolves into thin air]
Randy
[stunned, then annoyed] Oh. Oh I get it! [looks heavenward] Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!
Ghost
[floats by] Emily? [turns into the aisle where the woman was] Emily, the war is over! Let's go rent a movie at Blockbuster!
Randy
Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
Ghost
The hounds are calling, Emily. Let's rent something now! [floats past Randy]
Randy
I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
Ghost
[turns around and looks at Randy] The hounds, Emily! The hounds!
Randy
Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy! [sticks his tongue out and makes noises at him] "Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!" [Stan, who doesn't see the ghost, watches from a distance] Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!
Stan
[turns and walks to Sharon, who's at the counter looking up things on the ancient CRT monitor] I think something might be wrong with Dad?
Sharon
Ya think? [Stan glances up at her]
WEDNESDAY
HALLOWEEN. It's sunset and kids and their parents are out trick-or-treating. Butters and Jimmy run into Cartman and Kenny, who are not in costume
Butters
Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
Cartman
We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Cartman
Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
Butters
I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
Jimmy
Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style. [grins]
Cartman
Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
Butters
Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
Cartman
[walks off with Kenny] You'll just have to wait and see.
Blockbuster, at that moment. Sharon dresses Stan up as Captain America while Shelly reads a magazine behind the counter
Sharon
I think that's good. Feel tight enough?
Stan
Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.
Sharon
Let's see the shield.
Stan
[takes up the shield and strikes a pose] Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
Sharon
[claps] Yehay!
Randy
[arrives] Hey, whoa, what are you doing?
Sharon
Stan's about to go out with his friends.
Randy
Nono, I need everybody tonight! [Stan loses his enthusiasm] It's our big night!
Sharon
For what?!
Randy
Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!
Shelly
God I hate this family!
Sharon
Randy, let him go trick-or-treating.
Randy
[walks over to some end display] You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing [a cauldron full of them] and candy corn [in a display case]. This is the night we turn it all around.
Stan
[disappointed] Dad, nobody's gonna come.
Randy
Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
Stan
Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
Randy
Ew! [turns right and walks away] That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!
Stan
[moments later, on the land line] I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
Kyle
[dressed as Thor, in his living room] Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
Stan
I know, but there's nothing I can do.
Kyle
But what about the costume contest?!
Kenny
[dressed as Iron Man, comes in from the kitchen] What's going on, Kyle?
Kyle
Stan can't come.
Cartman
[dressed as Hulk, comes in from the kitchen] Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
Stan
I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
Kyle
Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
Stan
No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
Randy
[appears from an aisle] Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! [goes back into the aisle]
Stan
Oh never mind, I hate him again.
Kyle
Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
The neighborhood, later. Kyle pulls a skateboard along on which his iPad is mounted, and Stan is shown on the iPad
Kyle
All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?
Stan
How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
Cartman
This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
Kyle
He looks fine.
Stan
Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.
Cartman
Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, "Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!" [they head for a house to their left. Kenny rings the bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]
The Boys
Trick or treat.
Stan
Trick or treat.
Man 1
Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. [Each of the boys (except Stan) make a pose when their respective costumes are said]
Cartman
[dropping his pose] I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
Man 1
Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh [snaps his fingers] oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... [puts his left hand to his head]
Cartman
The Incredible...
Man 1
Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?
Woman 1
[raises her palms up, then rests them on her legs] Ohhh, cute!
Cartman
No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
Woman 1
[quick gasp] The incredible Harvey Fierstein?
Man 1
Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.
Cartman
The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
Man 1
The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
Cartman
[loses his cool and shuts his eyes] JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY! [moments later they're on to the next house] It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! [Kenny rings the door bell. A man opens the door holding a bowl of candy.]
Kenny
Trick or treat.
Man 2
Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!
Cartman
That's right!
Man 2
Oho, and Honey Boo Boo! [Cartman glares at him. The man looks back inside the house] Kids, come see the green Honey Boo Boo costume!
The sidewalk across from Blockbuster, Halloween night. A couple walks along laughing over something
Girlfriend
Oh, it's getting colder out.
Boyfriend
Yeah, you can definitely tell that winter's coming. [the woman glances to her right, then turns her head to the right. They both stop walking] What's the matter?
Girlfriend
That old creepy place. I saw someone in the window there. [as they look, Randy appears at one of the windows and beckons them to come in. Then he holds up a HALF OFF sign and shakes it a bit]
Boyfriend
Come on, let's get out of here. [puts his arm around her shoulders. They hurry off.]
Randy
[sighs and throws down the sign in frustration] They'll come! [walks off slowly and his voice gets deeper] Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
Blockbuster, maybe an hour later. The store is fully lit, but there's still no business. There's more snow on the parking lot so that it's almost fully covered. Randy's anger has solidified into a slumped angry walk as he wanders the aisles, grunting and spazzing every once in a while. He stops to fix some DVDs that are out of place, then walks to the candy display under glass in the counter
Randy
[closes his eyes and sobs a bit] Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?! [uncovers his eyes and moves his palms down to his cheeks] It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies! [places his hands on the counter] What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple. [notices something and pounds the glass] Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!
Ghost 2
[a former Blockbuster employee] Of course, Mr. Marsh. What'll it be?
Randy
I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
Ghost 2
Coming right up. [goes to retrieve the videos]
Randy
No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
Ghost 2
[types in the order] Your son and wife don't seem to quite agree with you about the video store. In fact, your son seems to think video stores are... as ancient as Madonna's boobs?
Randy
He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
Ghost 2
If I may say so, Mr. Marsh, your Blockbuster will never get any customers with those two Negative Nancys sabotaging you. You may need to do something... rather extreme. [more sinister] If I may say so, Mr. Marsh. [Randy looks at him, then at Stan, who is off in a corner looking at his iPad.]
Stan
Trick or treat.
Ghost 2
You are the owner of Blockbuster, Mr. Marsh. [Randy feels the pressure and resists it] You must be willing to do anything.
Randy
No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy! [notices Stan looking at him] Hey Stan. [turns and walks away]
Another neighborhood, night. The boys continue their trick-or-treating.
Kyle
We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
Cartman
Dude dude dude! Check it out. [points to something across the street... a robbery in progress. One robber is outside a Kum & Go minimart. He breaks a surveillance camera with a crowbar, then jimmies the door open and goes in]
Stan
What? What's he doing?
Kyle
Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
Cartman
[turns around] You guys, we've gotta stop it!
Kyle
[turns around] Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
Stan
Hey, where did you guys go?
Kyle
[turns his skateboard around] Oh, sorry dude.
Stan
All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
Kenny
Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
Cartman
Cartman SMASH! [they turn around and go into action]
Kum & Go, inside. The robbers get to work
Robber 1
All right, the camera's out. Hurry up, you two! [the other two robbers are trying to break into a Red Box rental box. They succeed, and some change falls out]
Robber 2
What the? You told me these things were full of money!
Robber 3
It's Halloween. I thought everyone would be renting spooky movies. [the boys break into the store, with Cartman acting like a rampaging Hulk]
Kyle
[holds up his sledge hammer] For Odin! For Asgard!
Robber 4
Who are you?!
Cartman
[roars some more, then] Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind. [walks to the counter and sees a dead clerk slumped over the counter] Holy shit, they shot this guy!
Kyle
Oh my God!
Kenny
Dude, fuck this. Let's bail! [the boys head out the front door with the robbers in hot pursuit]
Robber 4
Get 'em!
Blockbuster, at that moment. Sharon is on the land line with someone
Sharon
Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable. [Randy rises up from behind the bargain bin] No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in? [Randy slides to his right and out of view] You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home. [Randy appears from the right side of the store, way in the back, then disappears again] No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really? [Randy reappears from the left side of the store, right behind Sharon] Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen. [covers the mic and turns to Randy] Can I help you with something?
Randy
[in a deep falsetto] According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. [they look at each other for a few seconds]
Sharon
[goes back to her phone call] Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy. [Randy turns around and leaves] Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.
Back the the Kum & Go...
Robber 1
God damn it those kids saw us! And you let them get away!
Robber 3
It was the Avengers, Brad! [Robber 2 appears at a doorway]
Robber 2
Hey, we caught one of them. We got him tied up in the back. [hurries to the back, and the other two follow him]
The back room. Kyle's iPad is strapped to a chair
Robber 1
All right, who were your friends?
Stan
Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
Robber 2
He's lying. They saw everything!
Robber 1
Let's try this again. [takes out a switchblade and walks up to the iPad]
Stan
No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad! [the robber scratches the glass, leaving a deep gash] Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
Robber 4
Hey, one of them dropped this. [a flier] It's an invitation to a Monster Mash at the community center.
Stan
No no! We weren't gonna go there!
Robber 1
[puts away the switchblade and backs off] Sure you weren't! [walks away] Get rid of him!
Stan
NO! [shakes his head] I won't say anything, I promise! [Robbers 2 and 3 take the iPad out to the car]
The two robbers take the iPad to the side of the road in a desolate place. The trunk pops open and the two robbers look at the iPad
Stan
What are you gonna do? [Robber 3 takes the iPad out and carries it away] Please! Please just let me go! No!
Robber 3
Sorry, kid. End of the line. [throws the iPad into a ditch next to the road. The two robbers get back into the car and drive away]
Blockbuster, later. Randy has a fixed, angry look on his face as he watches a TV screen. On the screen is Ted, a teddy bear brought to life and now living with his owner as an adult. Ted and his owner share chips and John Adams beer. Over by the counter, Stan tries to make a call, but the cable has been cut in two
Stan
What the hell? [gets off the stool and walks over to Shelly] Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
Shelly
[hurriedly and worriedly looking through her duffel bag and back park] I can't find it, Somebody took it!
Sharon
[coming in from outside the store] All right Randy, where are the car keys?! [gets no answer] Randy, where are the keys to the car?! [still gets no answer. Randy is transfixed] God damn it! [walks away in a huff]
The desolate place, later. The couple who walked by Blockbuster before are walking along a path. The girlfriend holds on to the boyfriend's arm
Boyfriend
Did you have fun at the Halloween party?
Girlfriend
I did. Thanks so much, Ben. And thanks for walking me home. [she notices something off to her right and stops]
Ben
[the boyfriend] What's the matter?
Girlfriend
What is that? [lets go and walks towards the item]
Ben
Whaht is what?
Girlfriend
[stops by the iPad] Somebody dumped a... Oh my God, Ben, it's a little boy! [picks up the iPad, which has Stan back onscreen] Hello? [wipes the screen clean] Are you okay? Little boy?[the screen brightens up]
Stan
Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
Girlfriend
It's okay. Try and stay calm.
Stan
Oh, ah thank God you found me.
Ben
What is he doing way out here?
Stan
You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! [Ben and his girl look at each other]
Park County Police Station, night. The three Avengers are at the station talking to Sgt. Yates
Kyle
And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
Sgt. Yates
Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
Cartman
Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
Sgt. Yates
Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?
Officer
Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything.
Hell's Pass Hospital. Kyle's iPad is on a bed being tended to, and an officer stands by taking a statement from Stan
Stan
They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
Kyle
Stan! [leads the other Avengers and the police into Stan's hospital room]
Stan
Guys, you're okay!
Kyle
What happened to you?
Stan
It's all right, just a scratch.
Cartman
Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
Stan
No! They're looking for you there! [to Sgt. Yates] Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
Sgt. Yates
What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!
Officer 2
The Monster Mash is only on Halloween. [another officer quickly shushes him]
Kyle
Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
Stan
Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.
Sgt. Yates
How many people at the Monster Mash?
Officer 3
Most of the town, sir. It's a graveyard smash.
Officer 4
Look, whatever we do, we'd better hurry. It gets on in a flash.
Sgt. Yates
You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?
Kenny
Yes. We saw their faces.
Sgt. Yates
All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
The Monster Mash, night. PSY's song, "Gangnam Style", is playing as the town gathers inside the community center, which is decked out for Halloween. Many of the guests are dressed as PSY.
Butters
That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf. [a giant stops by] Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
Stan
Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
Butters
Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. [Gangnamstein turns left and runs into a man]
Stan
Oops.
Man 3
Gaaah!
Stan
Hey, be careful in there.
Officer 3
[side the Gangnamstein outfit] Sorry. I can't see a thing in here.
Stan
It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
A Banana
Wow, Gangnamstein. I wish I'd have thought of that.
Back at the Blockbuster, Randy now walks around in a limp and hunched over
Randy
Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING! [notices a video and stops] Oh look, Wedding Crashers. [takes it and carries it around, then notices Shelly and stops] What are you doing, Shelly?
Shelly
[sprays some lighter fluid onto some DVDs on a rack, then lights a match] Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. [tosses the match onto the floor]
Randy
Okay. [walks on] STAN! [Shelly squeezes some more lighter fluid onto the racks, which quickly go up in flames.] STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!
The Monster Mash. Mr. Mackey is at the podium dressed as PSY.
Mr. Mackey
Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay.
Stan
Wait a minute. There they are!
Mr. Garrison
[turns around] There's who? [the four robbers are shown]
Stan
Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- [some rustling is heard and Randy takes Stan's iPad from him]
Randy
Who are you people?! You aren't real!
Officer 3
Hey hay, I can't see! Where do I go? [begins to walk blindly, and the transformation to Gangnamstein is complete]
Randy
Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All! [everyone begins to run out of the community center.] I got a little somethin' for all of you! [takes a golf club from a golfer and starts swinging it around] Run! You'd better run!
a family watches a movie on an XBox in the living room. Gangnamstein crashes through the front door.
Randy
Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
Family
HAAAAA! [they get off their sofa and run]
Randy
Haarrrr! [walks forward]
A toddler's room. Two little boys watch a movie on a tablet. Gangnamstein breaks through the bedroom window and the boys hug each other in sheer fright.
Randy
Raaaawr! [falls to the floor, but gets up again]
Boys
AAAAA!
Randy
Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!
Boys
[get off the bed and run] AAAAA! [run out of the house, with Gangnamstein behind them] AAAAA!
Randy
AAAAA! [a spotlight shines on Kyle's iPad] AAAAA! [Gangnamstein raises its arms to shield itself from the light. Yates and his officers have arrived and are ready to shoot]
Sgt. Yates
FIRE! [the officers fire away]
Randy
Arrrg! [looks to his left] Hey, what are you doing?!
Stan
[gaining control of his own iPad] It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! [Officer 3 takes the iPad off and throws it away while he keeps getting shot, and finally falls over dead. The gunfire stops]
Sgt. Yates
We got the sonofabitch!
Officer 5
Wait, wasn't that Peterson in there? [Officer 2 shushes him quickly]
Sgt. Yates
Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay.
Robber 1
Not with the convenience of online streaming it don't.
Butters
Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. [Kyle knows what this means and walks over to his iPad]
Kyle
Stan?
Stan
Hey dude.
Kyle
The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it. [the low battery indicator pops up - 5% remaining] Oh God. [turns to the gathering crowd] SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER! [turns back to Stan] Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
Stan
It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK. [Kyle does so, and the indicator disappears] You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
Kyle
You're gonna see it. [to the crowd] WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
Stan
Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
Kenny
Yeah, Stan?
Stan
Stay gold. [the iPad runs out of juice and the screen goes black, except for some symbols indicating the iPad needs to be recharged. Cartman roars like Hulk.]
Blockbuster, midnight. Randy walks out of it in a stupor while flames inside it get bigger. Randy slurs his speech so it's hard to understand
Randy
Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan! [mumbles incoherently again, waving the videos he took with him in anger] Stan! [finally collapses into a snowdrift]
Blockbuster parking lot, morning. Randy is now frozen and covered in snow. His facial expression has gotten worse. Sharon, Stan, and Shelly arrive some time later
Sharon
I spoke with the insurance company. [the destroyed Blockbuster is shown] They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?
Randy
[through frozen lips] No...
Sharon
You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
Randy
Yeah...
Sharon
You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
Randy
Okay...
Sharon
What do you want from McDonald's?
Randy
Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. [Sharon and the kids turn and walk away. Presumably Sharon has the car keys now. Stan returns and replaces the videos Randy has in his hand with the same movies on his iPad]
End of A Nightmare on Face Time


A Scause For Applause
Walgreens, day. A line of people starts at the store entrance and goes out for blocks. Inside, two pharmacists sit at a folding table removing wristbands from people
Pharmacist
Next please. [one man gets off a stool and leaves, and another one steps up and sits in it] You are sure you want to do this?
Man
Of course I'm sure!
Pharmacist
[gets out some scissors and motions to the man] Okay, roll up your sleeve. [the man rolls up his sleeve as if he's going to receive a flu shot. The nurse sees the yellow bracelet the man is wearing and cuts it off, then puts it into a small tray to her right. The man looks a bit relieved]
Outside, Cartman waits for his turn to get the wristband cut off
Cartman
[upset] I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
Inside, Clyde gets his wristband removed
Clyde
Lying jerk! [hops off the stool and leaves. Mr. Mackey steps up and sits down on the stool, sobbing]
Pharmacist
[snipping off the wristband] Hold still please.
Mr. Mackey
[stands up and turns to leave] I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! [walks away still sobbing]
Cartman
All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?! [begins to roll up his sleeve, but then] Oh, hold on. [takes off his jacket and lets it drop to the floor] Aah, let's see... that one. [the same yellow one the others are having cut off. She cuts that one off] Stupid fraud! [spits onto the band] Good riddance to YOU! [picks up his coat and puts it on, walks off, and another man replaces him. The pharmacists adds Cartman's wrist band onto the others]
Man 2
All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me! [the pharmacist does so.]
Outside, Cartman walks out to find Kenny, Kyle, and Stan waiting for him
Kyle
Did you do it?
Cartman
Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
Kenny
(I told you it was a bad idea.)
Cartman
Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?! [Stan sighs and steps forward, turns right and walks away] What's wrong with him?
The Marsh house, day. Stan walks in and sees Randy on the sofa with a bottle of beer in hand
Randy
Oh I feel like such an idiot.
Stan
It's all right, Dad.
Randy
But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney! [turns on the TV and raises the volume] There's even more coming out about it today.
Anchor
These latest tests are once again confirming that the performance-enhancing drug HGH was in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. All over the country people are having their "What Would Jesus Do" wristbands cut off. It was just last week a team of scientists found traces of HGH on the Shroud of Turin [actual footage of a corner of the shroud being analyzed is shown] , along with several other illegal compounds and painkillers. [some lab testing is shown, then a panel of scientists addresses the issue]
Lead Scientist
Without a doubt there was uh HGH in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. Jesus did not suffer for our sins, he was in fact very high.
Randy
All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
Anchor
Priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove Jesus from the record books and from The Last Supper. [a painter is shown painting over part of Jesus' head. Next, Benedict XVI is shown speaking to the crowds at St. Peter's Basilica. The subs say "It's really a shame that Christ had to bring this embarrassment onto the church. We cannot tolerate any deity who used illegal substances to perform his miracles."]
Randy
I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. [Stan lowers his head and walks away. He goes upstairs to his room, enters and closes the door, and sits at his desk. He rolls up his left sleeve and gazes at his WWJD bracelet. He sighs heavily.]
South Park Elementary, day. The school day starts with the kids entering the main building.
Butters
Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, "Well, what about the New Testament?"
Cartman
Uh huh.
Butters
And he says, "Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up."
Cartman
So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times. [reaches his locker and opens it, then notices Stan. Butters walks over to Craig and another boy.] Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet!
Stan
All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
Cartman
The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
Butters
Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
Stan
Yeah I know.
Cartman
Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
Mr. Mackey
[walks by in a zombie-like fashion] Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do?
Craig
Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet.
Stan
Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
The Charlie Rose logo pops up on a TV
Announcer
It's the Charlie Rose show. Here's Chuck.
Charlie Rose
We are here tonight with the only person in America who still wears his "What Would Jesus Do" wristband. Please welcome Stan Marsh.
A Voice
Dick! [Stan looks around]
Charlie Rose
Stan, after everything that's come out, after all the facts have been proven, why do you still wear the wristband?
Stan
I don't know, [looks at his wristband] I just like it.
Charlie Rose
You just like it.
Stan
Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
Charlie Rose
Well joining us now is just one of the billions of people who think that anyone who still wears their "What Would Jesus Do" wristband is doing all of society a disservice. Chris Martin you say that Stan Marsh is... a dick?
Chris Martin
Yeah, yeah, thanks Charlie. My problem with this kid is he doesn't care about the truth! Okay, if Jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs, that's fine, but then he went on to say it was a miracle, and that is where it became dangerous! What about the Incas?! What about the Aztecs?! Millions of people who were murdered in Jesus's name, and then Jesus turns out to be a fraud! Wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone!
Charlie Rose
What do you say about that, Stan?
Stan
...I don't know. [checks his wristband again] I like it.
Charlie Rose
All right, well we searched high and low to find my next guest who actually agrees with Stan Marsh, and thinks he's doing the right thing. Please welcome a retarded fish. [the fish, wearing a cycling helmet, babbles in the water] Now, Retarded Fish, you don't see any problem at all with someone keeping their bracelet [the fish babbles some more]
Chris Martin
That that's because, that's because you're a retarded fish, and you don't know any better! What about the Crusades?! The Inquisitions?! How many people were tortured to death for somebody who is a fake?! [the retarded fish lets out a short "blat"]
Charlie Rose
What about the Crusades, Stan? Soes that enter into your decision at all?
Stan
No, I just, I don' know. No.
Charlie Rose
Anything to add, Retarded Fish?
Retarded Fish
Nnno, No, I'm good. Thank you.
South Park Elementary, day. Stan walks down the hall and Mr. Mackey spots him
Mr. Mackey
Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you? [Stan stops as Mr. Mackey approaches him] Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay?
Stan
I have?
Mr. Mackey
Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me.
Stan
You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
Mr. Mackey
Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it. [Butters walks by] Hey Butters. Stand ground.
Butters
[turns around and lift up his right arm] Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! [Stan is surprised to see Butters with a brown bracelet. Butters turns around and walks to his locker]
Mr. Mackey
Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay? [walks away. Stan walks over to Butters]
Stan
You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?
Butters
Well yeah. [points to it with his left hand] It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. [switches folders]
Stan
...Farmers in where?
A farm in Belarus, day. A group of farmers face down some bulldozers. A different language is spoken, but the subs say
Worker
Move aside, farmers! This land is no longer yours!
Farmer
We will not move aside! We will stand our ground! [shows off his bracelet] Like the child on the Charlie Rose show! [the other farmers cheer him on]
Stan
Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
Butters
I donno. I got mine down at 7-11. [takes Stan down to the store] See? Right here. [a small rotating stand stocked with Stanground Bracelets is shown]
Clerk
Hello, you interested in the Stanground braceleh-OH! Wow, it's you! [lifts up his right arm to show off his bracelet] Stanground, brah!
Stan
Wow, this is happening so fast.
Steve Nelson
Hello Stan, Steve Nelson with Endorsement Management. Are you ready for your Nike commercial? [looks at Butters, who smiles back at him]
The Nike commercial
Stan
[looking out over a river from a stone bridge] My friends told me I was crazy, [jogging down a sidewalk in a Nike jogging suit] that I was wasting my time. [holding court at a press conference. Cameras all around him take pictures] But my cause is to stand my ground. [sits in a park, then stands up as the sun sets] When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand... [faces the sun and raises his left arm, still wearing the bracelet. It begins to glow] for standing.
At a Sizzler
Waiter
Would you like to be seated?
Stan
No thanks. I'll stand.
At the movies
Moviegoer
Hey, you wanna siddown?
Stan
I'm good.
On a flight
Flight Attendant
Sir, the captain has asked everyone to take their seats.
Stan
Tell the captain to take off. [At the gym] People ask me, "You never took the bracelet off? Not once?" [outside, with a sunset behind him] No. Never. Not. Ever. [Three phrases pop up onscreen: "STAN for something. STAN up. STAN ground."] What do I do? I Stan ground. [a double swoosh appears onscreen]
South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison writes up a bunch of stuff on Dr. Drew
Mr. Garrison
Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-? [a classroom door flies open and a bunch of men pour in. Among them is the lead scientist on the Shroud of Turin.]
Lawyer
Mr. Marsh, if you don't mine, we'd like to see your bracelet.
Stan
For what?
Lead Scientist
If you have nothing to hide, then please hand it over, Mr. Marsh.
Kyle
What are you people talking about?
Field Reporter
Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together.
Lead Scientist
Please let us check your wristband for superglue.
Stan
No! This is stupid!
Butters
He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
Lead Scientist
Are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet, Mr. Marsh?
Stan
No! I never cut if off!
Lead Scientist
Then, let us ah-see it.
Jimmy
[pounding his desk with his fist] This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?
Lead Scientist
I cannot say, but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige.
Butters
Who?
Lead Scientist
All right, it was Craig. [another scientist steps aside to show Craig]
Cartman
Craig?! You asshole!
Stan
What's the big idea, Craig?!
Craig
It just looked like you cut it off, that's all.
Stan
You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
Butters
Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
The Class
Yeah!
Stan
You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
Butters
Go Stan!
Stan
And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
Butters
...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!
Stan
Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
The Class
Yeah!
Butters
Prostitute!
Breaking News
Announcer
This is breaking news.
Anchor
The tests are done and the results are in. The little boy who claimed he never cut off his "What Would Jesus Do" bracelet did cut it off, and lied about it.
Lead Scientist
Not only did we find traces of ah-superglue, but of yellow magic ah-markeur as well. This is a dark ah-day for honest French-Swedish people everywheure.
Anchor
Though the tests seem conclusive, Stan Marsh continues to deny any cheating.
Stan's room, night. He's got posters of STANdground all over his walls, but he's pissed off. Someone knocks on his door
Stan
Yeah. [the door opens and Kyle enters]
Kyle
Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
Stan
Thanks Kyle.
Kyle
You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
Stan
Why does it matter?!
Kyle
Because you kind of made it matter.
Stan
You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
Kyle
S-so you did superglue it.
Stan
[hops off his bed and walks over to his desk] Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
Kyle
Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
Stan
You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?! [Kyle looks around at all the Nike merchandise] This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
The lead scientist's mansion, night. He's dressed in pajamas and doing squats in his bedroom as his wife reads a book in bed
Wife
Would you mind getting me some water, darling?
Lead Scientist
Can't you see I'm trying to do ah-my calisthenics?
Wife
But my throat is parched, dear, and I'm so scared of burglars.
Lead Scientist
[stops and turns towards the bedroom door] Is ah-tap water going to be okay, or do you want me to go down to Crystal Geyser and bring Her Highness some right from the spring?
Wife
Tap is fine, dear. [the scientist leaves]
The lead scientist's mansion, night, outside. A shadow appears and approaches the front door.
The lead scientist's mansion, bedroom. The scientist gives his wife a glass of tap water and goes back to his calisthenics
Wife
What was that? I could have sworn I saw something outside.
Lead Scientist
It's ah-your imagination
Wife
[moments later] Oh darling, could you change the channel for me? The remote is dead. [the scientist glares at her, sighs heavily and goes to the TV, which is set to a show on the Jewelry & Gold Shopping Network]
Lead Scientist
[feeling bossed around] You just want me to change the channel or should I go and make a TV program written ah-just for you?!
Wife
No, just change to channel 10, thanks.
Lead Scientist
It's ah-starting to feel like ah-The Carole Burnett Show in here. [clicks through the channels]
The lead scientist's mansion, elsewhere. The shadow is now inside, and it bumps into a table on which a vase sits. The vase falls and shatters
Wife
What was that?! I think somebody's here!
Lead Scientist
[back to his squats] Maybe it's ah-the peepee fairy so somebody can ah-take a peepee for you too.
Wife
Please I'm terrified. Please go check it out. [the scientist again sighs heavily and leaves the room]
The mansion, elsewhere. The shadow approaches a corner when Stan comes in from the other side of the screen. The shadow turns out to be Jesus.
Stan
Jesus!
Jesus
Shhhh.
Stan
What are you doing here?
Jesus
My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...
Stan and Jesus
...to discredit him too.
Jesus
That's what I'm doing. [the lights come on]
Lead Scientist
Oh, it's ah-Tweedle Dumb and ah-Tweedle Dee trying to break in-ah-to my house!
Stan
Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
Jesus
Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.
Stan
Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.
Lead Scientist
Ah-excuse me, I'm sorry to intrude, but do you want to please ah-leave or should I make you some kofel bread and ah-sausages?!
The living room, later. They stay for bread and sausages.
Stan
It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
Jesus
Yeah, I know how it goes.
Stan
Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
Jesus
I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud.
Lead Scientist
[returns in a maid outfit over his pajamas] Here you go, kofel bread and some sausage for you.
Stan
Thanks a lot. [the scientist turns around and leaves.] Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
Jesus
NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?
Stan
NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
Jesus
Pff, I know, right?
Stan
Pff it's like, that's here [puts his hand up, palm down, about two inches above the bread] and...
Jesus
Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here. [briefly raises his left hand, palm down, to about six inches above Stan's head]
Stan
Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
Jesus
P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?
Stan
Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
Jesus
Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!
Stan
How can we raise awareness?
Jesus
We need to get some bracelets.
Something straight out of Dr. Seuss, day, Scauses Factory. Inside a fantastic building sits a man behind a warped desk. Stan and Jesus sit on two thrones opposite him
P.F. Pityef
Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service?
Stan
Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
P.F. Pityef
Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be?
Stan
Our... scause?
P.F. Pityef
Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs.
Jesus
I'm confused.
P.F. Pityef
Hm. Perhaps I should start from the beginning. [Stan and Jesus look at each other. What follows is a montage of Seussian animation elaborating on the poem below]
In the modern age there are those who believe
That a cause is a thing to be worn on one's sleeve. [the time frame here is the 1920s, based on the style of dress. everyone has their arms raised to show off their scauses]
And so, we sell a cause. It's called a scause.
And wearing a scause gets you lots of applause. [opens some doors to show some clapping machines]
We start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpist
Then dip it in colors that show off your purpose.
There are green scauses for recycling, blue scauses for kitties, [Animal Rights]
And pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties. [Breast Cancer]
Do you hate abortion? Ah! Then a white scause is for you! [Pro Life]
Why not champion your scause with some sparkles and glue?
We make scauses for this! We make scauses for that! [Chilean Miners, then Save The Dolphins, then Stop Water Pollution]
Why there's even a scause for just being fat! [Test Subject, with a Tree Hugger on the side]
What's the matter? Can't think of a scause? [talking to Jesus]
How about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozz?
Let's just think of the thing that you care about most. [talking to Stan, so Belarus]
Then let's make it orange, like marmalade toast!
And now I'd like to say "thank you" for your coming down.
I'm off to go sell these in your little town!

Stan
Dude, the hell just happen?
South Park Elementary, day. The students mill around in the hallway before class. Mr. Mackey walks among them.
Mr. Mackey
Kids? Kids, okay, I need to talk to you about a serious matter. [the group he addresses includes Red, Bebe, Butters, Jimmy, Craig, and Clyde] You probably all noticed my orange wristband [shows it off], mkay? It's to show my solidarity with the people of Belarus. [Stan is at his locker and notices, then turns toward the locker and smiles to himself] Mkay, you should know that the Belarusian government is right now trying to-
Craig
We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. [the kids raise their arms to prove it]
Mr. Mackey
Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay. [sees another group of kids and goes towards it] Uh hey kids. Kids over here...
Cartman
[meets the first group] Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
Clyde
There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
Cartman
Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
Clyde
Yes you do. [tugs on the yellow wristband]
Cartman
...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
Butters
[approaches Stan] Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
Stan
People are saying that? [pleased]
Butters
Yeeah. Is it true?
Stan
Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
Butters
Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole, [pokes Stan in the belly] but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. [smiles, turns and walks away]
Stan
[looks heavenward] We did it. [Butters goes around a corner and out of view]
The news.
Anchor
It has become the biggest concern for most people. The farmers of Belarus and their plight against their government. And now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis. His name? Jesus.
Belarus, day, a field. A group of farmers faces bulldozers and tanks.
Jesus
These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can.
Field Reporter
Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use?
Jesus
You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. [a tank unleashes a bomb and a bunch of farmers are killed]
Farmers
AAAAH!! [the tanks open fire with machine guns; more farmers are killed, until the last one falls]
Jesus
You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help.
Field Reporter
Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus.
Jesus
Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. [the tanks and bulldozers move forward to crush the corpses of the farmers]
Field Reporter
Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right?
Jesus
I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!
Field Reporter
Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?
Jesus
What? [turns around] Aw, shit!
South Park, day. P.F. Pityef is in town and has set up a makeshift Scauses stand on an empty lot between two other buildings. A small crowd is in front of the stand. In the crowd are Cartman, Butters, Craig, and Mr. Mackey
P.F. Pityef
One at a time, please. One at a time.
Mr. Mackey
Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m'kay?! [it looks like everyone else does too.] It's worthless now!
P.F. Pityef
Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more!
Cartman
[steps up] Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
P.F. Pityef
Absolutely! Five dollars please.
Stan stands across the street from the stand, and Kyle walks up to him.
Kyle
Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
Stan
[glares at Kyle] Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! [a bouncy noise is heard]
P.F. Pityef
Oh my, it's the sound!
Butters
Wu-what sound?
P.F. Pityef
Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound. [puts his ear against a funnel in which a penny circles round] That's the sound that means I must pack up my tent. It's the sound of the last cent being spent. [quickly goes to a control panel and starts pressing buttons, and his stand collapses into a truck. He gets in and drives off] My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo!
Cartman
...Fuck! Dude, weak. [the town is covered in scauses and looks like a Dr. Seuss town]
Stan's house. Jesus and Stan sit on the sofa looking dejected
Stan
It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
Jesus
Yeah...
Stan
We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
Jesus
Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.
Stan
Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
Jesus
What can we possibly do?
Stan
[after a long while] What would Jesus do? [Rocky fanfare plays and Jesus slowly gets energized. He gets off the sofa and walks to the dining room table, reaches into his robe and pulls out a big bottle of HGH. He plants it on the table and opens it. He pours some into the cap and drinks it. He transforms into a superhuman and flips the dining room table over. He turns and breaks through the front wall, obliterating the front door, and runs off to find the charlatan. Stan looks on] Yeheah! [Jesus goes to the Scauses factory and flips over every truck he finds in his way, then bursts into the factory. He beats up all the workers there]
Jesus
Vengeance is mine! [he destroys the assembly line]
P.F. Pityef
No please! Please show mercy!
Jesus
Get out! [picks him up and shoves him into a grinder. P.F. Pityef is ground up, but his remains clog up the grinder and raise the pressure throughout the factory. Soon the factory blows up. Everyone in town has shown up to see this and burst into applause. Later, Jesus is back to normal and on a small hill - a mount - and speaks to the crowd]
Jesus
Thank you my children. [the crowd quiets down] We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is [places his hands over his heart] right here. On T-shirts! [opens his robe enough to show his cause] Free Pussy Riot! [the crowd begins to clap and cheer]
Mr. Mackey
Free Pussy Riot!
The Boys
[look at each other and then] Yeah!
End of A Scause For Applause

Obama Wins!
A shot of Denver, Colorado, Tuesday. It's election day, 8:05 in the morning, Mountain Standard Time. At a Baptist church, a line of people waits to vote.
Denver Poll Worker
Okay, Mr. Thompson, voting line is right over there. [Mr. Thompson walks off] Next, please. [Cartman shows up dressed up in his festival best - dress shirt, suspenders, hat with a ribbon on it, and an all-day sucker. He's going to play on the sympathies of the elderly poll workers]
Cartman
Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
Denver Poll Worker
Oh dear, did you lose your mother, little boy?
Cartman
MOM!
Denver Poll Worker
Security?
Denver Guard
[shuffles up to the poll worker] Heaah?
Denver Poll Worker
This little boy lost his mom.
Cartman
She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
Denver Guard
It's all right, come on. [takes Cartman's hand and walks him away]
a plane zooms through the sky. Cartman has an aisle seat, and he checks his watch.
North Carolina, 12:18 pm Eastern (or 10:18 am Mountain, for reference). At the Charlotte Community Center, Cartman runs in, still in costume
Cartman
Mom? Where's my mom?
Charlotte Poll Worker
Oh dear. Did you lose your mommy, little boy?
a Jetstream Air zooms through the sky. Cartman has a middle seat. A flight attendant walks by and stops.
Flight Attendant 1
[to the aisle passenger] Would you like some warm nuts, sir?
Cartman
[wriggles in his seat and laughs] "Warm nuts", she said.
Florida, 3:40 pm Eastern (or 1:40 pm Mountain). At a polling station in Citrus County, Cartman stops in and clears his throat
Cartman
Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
a plane zooms through the sky. Cartman has an aisle seat again, and a flight attendant walks his way with snacks.
Flight Attendant 2
Warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts?
Cartman
[breaks into a smile and laughs] No way dude. No way.
Ohio, 5 pm Central (4 pm Mountain)
Cartman
MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
a plane zooms through the sky. Cartman has a middle seat again, and a flight attendant stops to offer the aisle passenger something.
Flight Attendant 3
Would you like warm nuts, sir? [the man accepts the nuts and smiles]
Cartman
Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. [both passenger and attendant frown at him]
Las Vegas, 3 pm Pacific (4 pm Mountain). Cartman runs through the polling station, and then back
Cartman
MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
Wednesday, the day after, Kyle's house. In the living room, Kyle and Ike sit on the sofa, with Ike crying.
News
Anchor
The people have spoken, and the President of the United States is once again, Barack Obama.
President Obama
I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever. [Ike begins to bawl.]
Kyle
Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all. [the phone rings and he answers it.] Hello?
Cartman
[from the Cartman kitchen] Hey Kyle. What's up?
Kyle
Nothing, watching the election results.
Cartman
Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society. [Kyle glances at Ike.] Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
Cartman's house, moments later. Cartman leads Kyle upstairs to his room
Kyle
Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
Cartman
You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
Kyle
It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
Cartman
Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? [beams]
Kyle
Sure you do!
Cartman
What if I did, Kyle?
Kyle
Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? [Cartman smiles and opens his bedroom door, then shows him in. Inside are stacks and stacks of ballots Cartman has stolen from various states: Nevada, Florida, Idaho, Colorado, Virginia, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Kyle's jaw drops]
Cartman
Pretty sweet, huh?
Kyle
What the hell is this?
Cartman
What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
Kyle
I don't believe it.
Cartman
No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
Kyle
Why do you have these?
Cartman
[walks up to a stack] Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle. [holds up a ballot] Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. [tears the ballot in two, lets the pieces fall, and fakes a shocked face]
Kyle
Dude!
Cartman
[Walks over to another stack] Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. [tears up that ballot]
Kyle
Knock it off, Cartman!
Cartman
Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
Kyle
You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! [turns around and walks out. Cartman waits a few seconds and walks to his window. He sees Kyle walk to the sidewalk, then turn right and go down the street.]
Cartman
Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
Liane
[steps in] Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?
Cartman
Thanks Mom, [she leaves] I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
The White House, day. A Secret Service agent runs down the hall towards the Oval Office, opens the doors, and goes in
Agent
Mr. President?
President Obama
Yes?
Agent
Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso.
President Obama
[picks up the receiver and presses the Line 2 button] Yes, hello General.
General Tso
We assume you are preased with the erection results?
President Obama
Very pleased. Thank you for your help.
General Tso
And you no doubt will now begin filling your side of the bargain.
President Obama
You'll have what you want. I'll meet you in three hours. [hangs up and slumps in his chair a little]
Agent
Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised.
President Obama
[rises and goes to a window] I don't know how they did it, but the Chinese secured my victory. I have to fulfill my obligation.
Agent
And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this?
President Obama
Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken.
Cartman's house, day. Kyle is at the front door with two police officers. One of the officers knocks, and Cartman answers the door.
Officer 1
Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
Cartman
[strokes his chin] Hmmm, no.
Officer 2
You mind if we search your room?
Cartman
I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
Kyle
This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
Officer 1
Let's just see. [the officers go in, and Kyle follows]
Cartman
Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
Kyle
Upstairs! First door to the left!
Upstairs. The officers have reached Cartman's room. Officer 1 opens the door
Cartman
I know my rights! Stop right now! [Kyle and the officers go in... and find nothing]
Kyle
But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
Cartman
I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
Officer 2
Oh my God, what have we done?
Officer 1
Guess this country is changing. We're sorry little boy, we're SO sorry. [The officers walk out]
Kyle
Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
Cartman
But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. [Kyle turns right and runs down the stairs]
The neighborhood park, day. Seven kids are shown playing basketball: Timmy and Jimmy are there, as are Stan, Token, Craig, Butters, and Kenny. Stan has the ball and tosses it to Craig, who makes a basket. Butters catches the ball. In the background, Kyle runs up to the entrance
Kyle
Guys! You guys! [runs into the group] Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
Stan
Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.
Kyle
Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
Stan
But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
Kyle
Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
Stan
I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
Jimmy
Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff.
Craig
Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.
Kyle
God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
Butters
Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
Kyle
[stares at Butters for a while] Butters, you know something, don't you?!
Butters
Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
Kyle
[walks towards Butters] What did Cartman tell you?!
Butters
He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think. [glances over his shoulder and gasps] Uh, don't make me say any more!
Kyle
Tell us what you know right now!
Butters
I can't! Don't you see?! [feels around his body for something, and finally finds it: a small bottle. He opens it up and pulls out a blue M&M.] Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
Stan
Is that an M&M?
Butters
[his voice trembles] It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
Kyle
Then you have to tell us!
Butters
Well... hah... HWAAAH! [quickly swallows the pill and makes sure he doesn't throw up]
Kyle
Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! [Butters falls back, stiff]
Stan
Pry his mouth open!
Craig
He ate it!
Kyle
Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
Butters
Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. [passes out]
Red Lobster, later. Cartman is at a table eating lobster legs. He's working on one plate while three others and a bucket of lobster legs await his appetite
Waitress
More melted butter, sir?
Cartman
Mm, mhm, mhm.
General Tso
[lets out an exasperated sigh] Little boy, the President is on his way to pick up the ballots. Where are they?!
Cartman
They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
General Tso
Alter our... The President will be here in moments with what we want!
Cartman
Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
A Diner
Oh my God, it's the President! [the President comes in with his Secret Service detail and diners come up to greet him]
President Obama
Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private?
Diner 1
Oh, of course. Come on, let's let the President have some peace and quiet. [the diners begin to leave the restaurant]
Diner 2
Wow, the President eats at Red Lobster. He's just a normal guy like me.
Diner 3
Come on guys. President says "get out." [chuckles]
Diner 4
I didn't actually vote for him. [chuckles. Two agents guard the doors until the diners are gone, then close the doors, while two other agents join President Obama at the table]
President Obama
All right. Where are the ballots? [Cartman cracks open a lobster leg.]
The ER, somewhere, day. The boys are there to visit Butters and the doctor is with them.
Doctor
Your friend has had a severe allergic reaction.
Kyle
Can we please just try and talk to him?
Doctor
All right, but don't take too long. [the boys go in]
Butters
[hard to understand with his face puffed up] What's up fellas?
Kyle
Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
Butters
Bleh, ogayedmi.
Kyle
I didn't wanna have to do this. [opens his flip phone and presses some keys] but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
Butters
AGH! No! Please! You can't!
Kyle
Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
Butters
Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
Stan
What'd he say? [Kenny mumbles his reply and Stan understands that] Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? [Butters mumbles a reply]
Kyle
What? [Kenny mumbles his translation] You mean the missile defense program?! [to Butters] Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
Butters
At Red Robster. [Kyle looks at Kenny]
Kenny
(At Red Lobster.)
Kyle
[still not getting it] Where?
Butters
[enunciating as best he can] Red Lobster!
Stan
Huh?
Jimmy
He said "at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red"
Butters
[enunciating as best he can] Red Lobster!
Kenny
(Red Lobster!)
Kyle
What?
Jimmy
Ruh Rehh... Red
Butters
[stressing] Red Lobster!
Kenny
(Red Lobster!)
Stan
Oh, Red Lobster.
Red Lobster, later. The high-level meeting continues
President Obama
General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not?
General Tso
Sssure, we have the ballots, but we don't have them right here with us now. [Obama looks at the general, then glances at Cartman]
President Obama
Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?!
Kyle
All right, where are the missing ballots?! [noticing the President] President Obama?
Cartman
Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
General Tso
Mr. President, we got you reelected! Now you will give us the Star Wars technology so that we can make the sequels!
President Obama
I told you China would get the rights to Star Wars from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure! [looks at Cartman] Until I have those ballots [looks at the general] it is not secure!
Kyle
Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
Morgan Freeman
[voice only] What's going on is the sale of America's greatest asset. [music plays as he walks into view] You see, when the United States created Star Wars it made this country incredibly powerful.
General Tso
Morgan Freeman?
Morgan Freeman
[pacing back and forth] Earlier this week, Lucas signed the rights to Star Wars over to Disney, and the Chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves. The Chinese government knew that President Obama would help them take the rights from Disney if they helped him get reelected.
Craig
Ohhhh.
Morgan Freeman
But the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them, and won't give them to anyone until his demands are met. You've all got quite a mess on your hands. I wish you well with it. [turns around and goes back the way he came in]
Stan
Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman: [Freeman turns around and faces the group] How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
Morgan Freeman
Because every time I show up and explain something, I earn a freckle. [a sparkle lights up on his right cheek as a small bell sounds, fades, and leaves a new freckle there. He turns around and resumes his departure]
Cartman
So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
General Tso
That was not the deal! We will not be a-bullied by you!
Cartman
Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. [takes out a small ball-shaped bomb, smashes it against the table, and disappears in the resulting smoke.]
Jimmy
Heheh, I get it. General Tso's chih-chih-chicken.
Two secret service agents walk down a hallway somewhere
Mike
You are absolutely sure about this?
Agent 2
It's been confirmed, Mike. My God, we might have won this thing. [they reach the end of the hall]
Mike
[knocks three times, then opens the double doors and goes in] Sir? Sir, we have some... incredible news. There are rumors of hundreds of thousands of stolen ballots. You might have won the election after all. [Duck President is shown. He lets out a loud quack with shit spewing out his mouth]
Cartman's house, evening. Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Token are in Cartman's living room rummaging through boxes of clothes looking for the ballots. Craig rips open the sofa cushions to look for them
Stan
There's nothing here, Kyle. [Jimmy walks in from the dining room]
Kyle
Anything in the basement, Jimmy?
Jimmy
Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos
Kyle
Well keep looking.
Liane
[walks in with some items] Oh my goodness, what's going on?
Kyle
Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
Liane
Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?
Stan
He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
Liane
[walks towards the kitchen] Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.
Jimmy
There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue.
Stan
Oh my God you guys, look! [points across the street. The boys walk out as the sound of a large vehicle is heard] Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! [Indeed. The ship arrives and positions itself for landing, then descends onto the road. After a big thud, the ship's door opens... and out swaggers Mickey Mouse]
Mickey Mouse
Just what the Dickens is going on here, haha?!
Stan
Aw shit, it's him again.
Mickey Mouse
What's this about a deal with the Chinese?! I own all this shit now! I own the Death Star! I own Tatooine! It's all MINE, haha! All right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? Haha.
The hospital, night. Butters is still in recovery, and his face is still puffy. He's asleep
Cartman
Butters. [Butters jumps up and is wide awake] You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
Butters
I didn't say anything. I promise.
Cartman
I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
Butters
Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
Cartman
Shhh, it's okay, Butters. [brings forth an M&M bag and opens it] Nobody's gonna find the election ballots. [pulls out a blue almond M&M.] I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look. [places the M&M in Butters' mouth and closes it] A place in town people barely even know exists.
A Hummer outdoor dealership. The salesman stands around waiting for customers. Behind him is a lot full of pristine Hummers
Salesman
Hey guys. Lookin' to buy a Hummer today? [a family leaving the KFC across the street heads for its car in the KFC parking lot] We're havin' a Rocktober sales event day that's goin' into Rockvember. [the family piles into the car, the father starts it, and the family drives away. The salesman watches the family leave, then turns around and walks to a different spot - next to the missing ballots.] Hey there! Interested in test-drivin' a Hummer today? [a lone man walks slowly down the sidewalk on a cross street. Mr. Hummer takes out his hands and starts gesturing] I can see you, with the Ray-Bans, got that nice bicep haning' out the window rolled down, whattaya think? [the man looks at him, then begins to walk faster] Rockvember sales event, guys! Every Hummer comes with a free Segway.
Café Monet diner
[at a Café Monet across a third street.] Hey why don't you shut up?!
Salesman
I'm just excited about all these deals, that's all. [puts his hands in his pockets]
Disneyland, night. The park has closed. AT-STs patrol the grounds as TIE fighters zoom by overhead. Mickey walks through Cinderella's castle towards a door as it opens upward and reveals two storm troopers escorting Cartman, in handcuffs, to him
Storm Trooper
We found him sir, but still no sign of the missing ballots.
Mickey Mouse
Go on! Leave us alone! Haha. [the storm troopers step outside and the door comes down behind them. Mickey and Cartman walk away from the door] Now listen, little boy, the reason this country works is because people go out to vote. Every vote counts. And you need-
Cartman
Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
Mickey Mouse
Why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! It will make your death a lot less painful! Haha.
Cartman
Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
Mickey Mouse
[whips out his light saber] Pretty neat, huh? How would you like to have one?
Cartman
I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
Mickey Mouse
[turns off his light saber] Like what?!
Cartman
I want a part in the new movies!
Mickey Mouse
[brightens up] Well then, why didn't you just come to me in the first place? If you wanna be in the next Star Wars, I'm your guy! Haha.
Cartman
I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
Mickey Mouse
You can be Luke's son, you can be Han Solo's son, I don't give two shits and a popsicle.
Cartman
Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
Mickey Mouse
Sure thing. I've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha.
Cartman
Haha.
Mickey Mouse
Haha.
Cartman
Haha. [and a new partnership is formed.]
Breaking Election News.
Wolf Blitzer
This is Breaking Election News. Hold that phone! The election may be over, but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for Mitt Romney were stolen!
Kyle
[with a field reporter at City Hall, with the other boys behind them] We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
Field Reporter
And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us.
Kyle
Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. [sirens and bells sound]
Field Reporter
Is that it? Did he just? Did he just?
Wolf Blitzer
Yup. Chris, we're getting confirmation that was the millionth time.
Chris
Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. [confetti and balloons float down from the sky]
Kyle
What?
Field Reporter
Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel?
Kyle
[quite confused] I... what? [a woman comes in from screen left with a check for five thousand dollars from P.F. Chang while another woman comes in from screen left with a sign saying "ONE MILLION TIMES!!!!!"]
Field Reporter
He's being presented with the check now, a five thousand dollar gift certificate to P.F. Chang's. [Kyle holds the check up and the reporter gets closer to the camera] This has been a long campaign, but someone's finally done it, Wolf.
South Park, later. The boys are sitting on the curb near Tele's, eating Chinese food
Stan
Well, we tried, dude.
Kyle
It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
Stan
Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
Kyle
It matters, Stan. It it matters.
A Santa
[voice only] Ho ho ho hoo! [Kyle glances at the TVs and walks over to get a better look] Come on down to Stevenson Hummer for our big Christmas in Humvember Sale! [same dealership as earlier, with Mr. Hummer wearing Santa facial hair and cap, ringing a bell and shaking a rattle stick] Not sure what to get your loved one this holiday season? Why not give them a nice Hummer? Nothing beats a Hummer on Christmas morning! [dances a bit. Stan joins him at Tele's picture window]
Stan
Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
Stan
Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?
Kyle
[realizing where the ballots could be] Oh my God.
Stevenson's Hummer, day. A diner leaves Café Monet and walks down the street.
Mr. Stevenson
[the salesman] Hey, looking for a Hummer today? Got some 2009s here. Never been driven. ...Ever. [a crow lands on a blue Hummer. Mr. Stevenson notices, turns around and moves towards it] Go on, get out of here! Shoo! [the crow leaves as Kyle and friends show up and enter the lot]
Kyle
Look! There they are!
Mr. Stevenson
Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies!
Kyle
We found it, you guys! [hears some vehicles showing up and looks] Oh no, they followed us! [several black cars pull up and the Chinese pour out of them]
Mr. Stevenson
Oh hell yes! Asians! Hey guys!
General Tso
Get out of our way!
Kyle
No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
General Tso
[pulls out a pistol from his pocket and aims it at Kyle] I am tired of playing games! This little farce is ovah! [a shot from a ray gun obliterates the pistol]
Cartman
[on a tauntaun] I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! [police cars show up]
Mr. Stevenson
Oh my God it's a sales rush! [the police pour out of their cars]
Officer 2
Oh my God. Are those what I think they are?
Cartman
Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
Officer 3
Sir, we've found something, at the Hummer sales lot outside of town.
General Tso
You don't understand. We are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made!
Kyle
Protect it?
Officer 4
What the hell is going on here?!
Morgan Freeman
[voice only. The officers all face him] Perhaps I can explain it to you. [appears between the Hummers and walks up to the group] You see, it turns out the only reason the Chinese so desperately wanted Star Wars is because they're afraid that Disney might not be the right place for it. The Chinese simply want to guard Star Wars impeccable legacy.
Officer 5
Is that Morgan Freeman?
Morgan Freeman
And now we're at a crossroads. If these ballots are made public, then the man the people voted for will be President, but he will no doubt keep Star Wars from the Chinese, and allow Disney to keep it instead. And so we have to ask ourselves, "What's more important? That the right man is elected President, or that Star Wars is with people who will protect it most?" [six new freckles appear on his face, and he caresses his right cheek]
An Officer
[through a walkie-talkie] Unit 4, what is it?! Over.
Officer 1
Well kid?
Kyle
Well... if you put it that way...
An Officer
Come in Unite 4! What have you found?!
Officer 1
Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out. [Stan walks up to the ballots with a match, strikes the match against the asphalt and lights it, and sets fire to the ballots]
Cartman
No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! [the Chinese, the police officers, and the boys all hold hands around the bonfire and begin to chant]
Group
Obama is President again. [as the smoke gathers in the sky, a real-life image of President Obama appears and sways slowly back and forth.]


Let Go, Let Gov
The bus stop, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are waiting for the bus
Kyle
I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this [holds his hand out], and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
Cartman
[walks up to them, talking to someone on the phone via speaker] Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
Lawrence
How many hours were you guys playing?
Cartman
Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like "Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!"
Kyle
AAAARGH!
Lawrence
You were playing football?
Cartman
Yeah, but I was like "I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle." In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
Kyle
That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
Cartman
[softly, covering the phone] Kyle, this is a private conversation.
Kyle
Then take that shit off speaker phone!!
Lawrence
Is that that same kid?
Cartman
Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
Kyle
How do we have a choice?!
Cartman
Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
Lawrence
Yeah yeah, you said that.
Toby
My dad says the government keeps a database on everyone.
Cartman
Who is that? Is that Toby
Toby
Yeah.
Cartman
Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
Toby
Yeah, we're ditching school.
Cartman
You're what? What, you say?
Lawrence
Me and Toby are ditching school!
Cafeteria, lunchtime. The boys are at table, and Kyle looks worn out.
Cartman
I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore! [he's not talking to his friends at the table, but to his friends on the conference call] Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read "1984"?
Lawrence
I don't think so.
Cartman
See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! [Kyle takes the top bun off his burger]
Lawrence
That'd be cool.
Cartman
That'd be what?
Lawrence
That'd be COOL.
Cartman
I know, right? [Kyle puts the bun back on the burger, then takes his tray with him and walks away] A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages! [having lost his appetite, Kyle throws his food away, puts his tray on the nearby cart, and walks off. Cartman approaches the trash can] I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now. [carelessly throws his trash away, with fries spilling onto the floor, puts his tray carelessly on the card, then walks off behind Kyle] I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know? [Kyle stops, his anger rising] Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my "Stop Listening To Me" Web site. [turns on the video feature on his phone and starts recording] What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret! [ends the video and goes back to his phone friends. Kyle leaves] You guys gonna update your blogs too?
Outside on the playground. Cartman is still on the phone with Lawrence while Kyle and Kenny try to play tetherball. Cartman is just too damned loud.
Cartman
Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
Lawrence
I said I got your tweet and the address!
Cartman
Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
Toby
Yeah, I'm here, bro.
Cartman
Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. [Kyle just walks up to Cartman and stands next to him]
Kyle
[calmly] Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
Cartman
Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle! [runs off, then stops and addresses everyone on the playground] Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
Butters
Ww-ww-what's the N S A?
Cartman
That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? [walks away. The other kids disperse and go back to what they were doing. Only Butters and Kyle remain.]
Butters
The government watches everything we do?
Butters' bedroom, night. As a moonbeam bathes his bedroom, Butters is still wondering about the government watching him.
Butters
Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government. [smiles, then walks to his bed and goes under the covers, then gasps] Oh yeah. [gets out of bed and goes to his mark] Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble... [a little softly] I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year. [normal] 'Night, Government. [goes back to bed]
The school's computer lad, next day. The kids are typing away on their keyboards and Cartman is on the phone again...
Cartman
Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
Lawrence
They're spying on you?
Cartman
Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, "you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek." I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?! [pounds the keyboard with his right fist. The other kids begin to star at him] This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
Lawrence
Like what?
Cartman
Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
Lawrence
Naw, don't do that.
Cartman
No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna- [gets suspicious] Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence. [hides behind his monitor for a moment, then slowly stands up on his chair] I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room. [sits down] Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
Lawrence
You need that new thing where you don't need to type.
Cartman
What, they already have something better than Twitter?
Lawrence
You haven't seen the Alec Baldwin commercial?
Cartman
No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
This one. Alec Baldwin is on the set of his latest movie, in his director's chair
Alec Baldwin
Hello. I'm Alec Baldwin, and I love social media. [whips out his phone] But sometimes, I accidentally tweet things that are homophobic. I don't think that way, I just type that way. That's when I realized it wasn't me that was homophobic, it was my thumbs, and they needed to be gotten rid of. [a shot of him chopping his right thumb off with a meat cleaver, then doing the same with his left thumb. He groans in pain each time.] So then the problem was, I don't have thumbs. But I know that everyone in America still wants to hear everything I have to say.[Now in a park by a lake. He's on a bench, with a camera behind him. He turns to look at it] Well, that's okay, because now there's a device that can actually take the thoughts in your head and send them directly to the Internet. It's called... Shitter. [points to a pair of antennae attached to the crown of his head. Next follows a stick-figure representation of the process]Wires are grafted harmlessly into your skull and any thought you have is uploaded to the Internet, and on to all your Shitter followers. [more stick figures appear, each with their own Shitter antennae. Then he's shown at a baseball park: "I'm at a Yankess game right now." The men on either side look at him. "God I love baseball." Next he's on a plane next to an elderly woman with her cat in a pet carrier. "People who take their cats on planes should be shot." He looks away, and the elderly woman looks at him. Next he's at a theatre. "I'm at a really great musical right now." The woman to his left notices the antennae. Next he's at an outdoor restaurant looking at a menu. "In 1992 I had sex with the Queen of Monaco. I had my entire fist up her ass." Back on set] Don't let your social media slow down our need to communicate with the world. Go direct from thought to Internet ...with Shitter. ["Just finished my Shitter commercial. Time to go find a pussy sandwich."]
South Park Elementary, day. Kids are milling around the hallways. Kyle is shown walking down one hall when Cartman's voice is heard
Cartman
["Alright, what's up everybody, what's up? I'm about ready to go to the NSA undercover, and see if I can expose some of those secrets." When Cartman appears, Kyle stops. "You can follow me on my Shitter account at #keepyourgovernmentoutofmybusinessdotcom. Wait, sh, I've gotta be careful. Kyle is here and I'm pretty sure he's tryin' to listen in."]
Kyle
[notices the Shitter device and gets angry.] What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman
[walks up to Kyle. "Kyle, if you wouldn't mind, this broadcast is for my Shitter followers only." Clyde and Stan join them]
Clyde
What's Shitter?
Cartman
[leans towards Clyde. "Don't know if you've heard, but the government is actually able to monitor all our e-mails and Twitter accounts." leans towards Clyde. "With Shitter I don't even need a cell phone. My thoughts are sent directly to the Internet, and then to everyone else on Shitter."]
Stan
Wow.
Cartman
[leans towards Stan. "Yes. Now as I infiltrate the NSA, I'll be able to broadcast everything to all my Shitter followers."]
Kyle
You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
Cartman
Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
Clyde
How many people are on Shitter?
Cartman
Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
Alec Baldwin
["I'm about to sit down and eat a sandwich at this amazing deli run by two faggtots in Chelsea."]
Cartman
["Oh cute. I'll have to try it out sometime, lol."]
Alec Baldwin
["In 1982 I was at a party at Mike Douglas' house and I fucked Kim Basinger."]
Cartman
["Wow, that's kewl. She's cute. ;) emoji"]
Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles, day. Butters is waiting to be called. A monitor displays "TICKET #395 WINDOWS 15" and a small bell dings.
Butters
Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. [ding]
Clerk
[not shown] Next!
Butters
Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, "If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness." Are these people nice?
Man
DMV people? They're the meanest people on planet Earth.
Butters
Oh Jeez. [The monitor displays "TICKET #403 WINDOWS 15" and a small bell dings. Butters gets off his seat...] Oh God, huh... Here we go. [...and walks up to a clerk, but has no idea what to do] I yelled at a midget. [a few seconds pass by] I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was "Pink" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! "Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!" [no reaction] And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang "My Country Tis Of Thee" 100 times! And I watches "America's Got Talent" twice! What else can I do?
Clerk
Why not a thousand "Livin' In America"s?
Butters
Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! [begins to walk away and launches into the song]
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
[exits]

N.S.A. Headquarters, Maryland, day. Cartman walks in, dressed in a suit and wearing a fake mustache, and approaches the front desk.
Receptionist
Can I help you sir?
Cartman
Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
Receptionist
All right, and your name?
Cartman
Bill Clinton.
Receptionist
[checks her calendar on the computer] I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton.
Cartman
Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
Alec Baldwin
["If you're ever in Los Angeles, be sure to look up Jennifer Love Hewitt. She can make a pussy sandwich that will give those faggots in Chelsea a run for their money"]
Chief
What have you got, Patricia?
Patricia
Uh, this man says he has an interview for a job, sir?
Cartman
I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
Alec Baldwin
["I borrowed my brother's dick once to fuck Darryl Hannah."]
Cartman
[clears his throat as a distraction] I was um, sure that the appointment was today.
Chief
That's quite alright. The NSA needs all the help it can get. Come on upstairs and I'll show you around, see if you're fit for the job.
The neighborhood. Two women knock on Butters' door. Butters answers it and sees two Polynesians. One carries a Bible, the other carries some pamphlets
Pamphleteer
Hello sir. My colleague and I are going through the neighborhood and seeing if you'd like to know the Truth. [hands him a pamphlet]
Butters
Sure, I love the Truth.
Pamphleteer
Okay, we from uh Jehovah Witness. We Kingdom Hall Jehovah Witness, and uh, we believe, sir, that uh many people interpret the Bible it wrong.
Butters
Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
Pamphleteer
We are, sir. We believe the, the Truth. I was once like you. I knew not what to believe, then I let my pulvy the Jehovah into the heart.
Butters
Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
Pamphleteer
Yes, because uh Jehovah will bring judgement against all who perish like the little girl will burn in fire.
Butters
Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
Pamphleteer
The government ih watching me?
Colleague
Wansa?
Pamphleteer
He said the government ih watching us. [they turn slowly to face the street]
Colleague
Hi now?
Pamphleteer
How long they been watching us?
Butters
Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
Pamphleteer
[turns to face him] I don't go to DMV. I don't have car.
Butters
Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature? [goes and gets some booklets he picked up at the DMV. He hand them the booklets and they leaf through them] This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! [smiles and closes the door, then walks towards the kitchen]
N.S.A. Headquarters, Maryland, day. The chief takes Cartman on a tour.
Chief
Right this way, Bill. Welcome to the NSA main office.
Cartman
Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
Chief
There's a lot of people working here at the NSA. Good people, people who just wanna keep America safe. Only problem is, checking all those e-mails, Twitter accounts, and surveilling all those phone calls can take a lot of manpower. [they stop at a desk]
Detective
Hey Joe?
Joe
Whatchoo got, Miller.
Miller
Got a 24-year-old male in Albuquerque. He just e-mailed his wife and asked if she could go to the store after work. Then he called the fitness center to set up a membership. He liked the fitness center, so he tweeted his friends that they should try it out.
Joe
...Alright, keep an eye on them. Let me know if anything changes. [he and Cartman move on]
Miller
Will do.
Joe
It's a never-ending grind here at the NSA, and it seems there's never enough detectives to keep track of everyone. [they go further into the office to reveal a large room with over a hundred detectives all at their desks keeping tabs on everyone else.] Sergeant! What have you got, Larson.
Larson
Got a seventeen-year-old female down in Jacksonville. She called her friend and asked her if she wanted to see the Percy Jackson movie. Then she e-mailed her mom at work and asked if it was okay. The mom said yes, but called her husband first to make sure there weren't any dinner plans.
Joe
Alright, keep an eye on all three of them.
Larson
Will do. [Joe and Cartman walk a few steps, then turn around. Behind them is the other half of the large room.]
Joe
If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man.
Detective
Sir, you might wanna check this out.
Joe
What have you got?
Detective
Thirty-two-year-old pizza delivery man. He just put it on his Twitter account that he hates America and wants to blow up the Lincoln Memorial. [long pause]
The city, day. Joe and Cartman are in an NSA vehicle pursuing this lead. Here's the NSA as police force.
Cartman
["Four sixteen pm. The chief asked me to join him as he went to question the possible suspects. I agreed to go along. Hopefully, the NSA has no idea of my secret intentions." The chief looks at him. "lol." The chief focuses on the road again. Moments later they stop in front of a house and get out of the car. The chief knocks on the door and a hippie answers it.]
Hippie
Well well, the NSA. I should've known.
Joe
We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.
Hippie
Hey man, I was just blowin' smoke. Say, what right does the government have reading my private e-mails anyway?! Haven't you squares heard of the Constitution?
Joe
Yeah, we've heard of that. We've also heard of the Declaration of Independence. See, there's a lot of people out there who think like you, people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens. That is, until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life. You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I can guarantee you.
Hippie
Yeah? What's that?
Joe
You won't care who's checkin' your Twitter account then. [holds up a hard copy of the delivery man's tweets.]
Hippie
...I never thought of it that way.
Alec Baldwin
["I fucked Jack Lemmon's makeup girl in a Port-A-Potty. Woops." The chief notices the lights on Cartman's Shitter device but doesn't say anything.]
Craig's house, day. He's on the sofa watching Terrance and Phillip on TV.
Terrance
Hey Phillip! Pull my finger! [the doorbell rings and he gets up to answer it] Aaaahahahaha. [he opens the door and sees Butters with the two Polynesian women]
Butters
Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
Craig
...The truth about what?
Butters
We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
Craig
...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so.
Pamphleteer
My colleague and I, we went to saaah experience at DMV. We went to DMV, we admit all our shortcomings an sins and uh make a tital wave of peace and serenity with the truth stored inside our heart.
Craig
...Okay. [next scene, all four of them are on the sofa.]
Butters
You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
Craig
Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.
Butters
Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama. [hands him a booklet] Could you read this part out lout?
Craig
[slowly reading] Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
Butters
Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
Craig
I have no idea.
Butters
Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
Pamphleteer
Yes sir. [the boys look at her] See, i used to be like you. I go around sending them nasty e-mails and a nasty texts, puttin' nasty picture on my nasty Facebook. But then I realized, all these things, they live forever, because the government keep a file on us. So all that live forever up in what they call the Clou'. It's a government term. If they could put a file in the Clou', then I wanna make sure I come clean about the bad ones and maybe get those things off my record off the Clou'. Because we all live forever in the Clou'.
Butters
Uh huh. [looks at Craig] Did you follow all that, Craig? [his eyes dart around] Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
N.S.A. Headquarters, Maryland, day. Back at the main office, Cartman now has his own desk as an NSA detective.
Cartman
["I've done it. I've infiltrated the NSA, and gained their trust." A shot of Alec Baldwin and his date at a buffet restaurant. The camera pans across until it reaches the couple. "So far, I've not ascertained how they were able to keep track of everyone in the country, but I'm close. Very close. I just hope that I'm not found out as a whistleblower before I'm able to expose their entire operation."]
Date
What is that voice?
Alec Baldwin
Some little faggot in my head.
Cartman
Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
Detective 3
Pretty simple. Everyone has a file. People who have a status of "threat", "possible threat", or "person of interest" are the ones we really wanna look at.
Detective 4
The more we pay attention to them, the bigger their file becomes.
Cartman
Really? How big is my file?
Detective 4
Huh?
Cartman
Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
Detective 3
Jarvis, what have we got on an "Eric Cartman"? Any files on Eric Cartman.
Jarvis
Ohhh yeah, we tracked him for a little bit, but Central Computer designated his status as "fat and unimportant."
Cartman
Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to "ripped and sweet." [no one listens. He stands up on his desk] 'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles, day. Officer Barbrady stands at the counter holding his hat in his right hand...
Barbrady
And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty.
Clerk 2
What the? [looks over his left shoulder] Why do these people keep coming here?
Barbrady
But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever
Clerk 2
Next, please! [ding]
Barbrady
Thank you. [puts on his hat and walks away. Nearby is a little group Butters has been forming, and Barbrady stops by]
Group
[clapping] Yaaaaaay.
Butters
Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?
Barbrady
I, I feel really good.
Group
[clapping] Heehhhhhhhah. [in the waiting area, a woman peeks over a man's shoulder to see what's going on]
Customer
Wow, those people over there seem like they're havin' fun. [Barbrady hugs the colleague and shakes the pamphleteer's hand]
Butters
[takes a few steps away from the group] I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance. [the group turns to face the flag] I pledge allegiance.
Group
To the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [while the group recites the Pledge, the following takes place]
Larry
[walks in and crosses the room towards the group] What the hell is going on here?! This is the DMV! There will be no joy here!
Clerk 3
Uh people keep showing up and telling us what they did wrong.
Customer 2
Hey, I'm just trying to renew my license. How much longer do I gotta wait? [the group finishes the Pledge]
Larry
[faces the customer and points at him] Shut up! Sit there and wait, and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously! I'll put a stop to this! [walks to the group]
N.S.A. Headquarters, Maryland, day. Cartman pleads his case.
Cartman
Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
Chief Joe
Not according to the Central Computer.
Cartman
The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
Chief Joe
Sorry, [stands and moves away from his desk] but if Central Computer says he is not a threat, then we can't do anything. [moves through the office]
Cartman
[runsn to catch up with the chief] Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
Chief Joe
There's 300 million people out there. How do you think we're able to keep track of every single person in the country? How do you think we're able to really know who's doing what?[they reach a pair of thick steel doors]
Cartman
I don't know.
Chief Joe
Alright, I'll show you. But this is very top security stuff, because if people knew how we did it, then everyone would do it. Then our enemies would do it. We can't let our enemies get their hands on this.
Cartman
Get their hands on what? [the chief presses some keys on the keypad next to the doors, and the doors open] Dude... [Santa is shown suspended in midair by a harness. Cables go from Santa to the surrounding wall of computers, and a massive one is attached to his privates. Several techs stand on a platform circling the room, looking at some of the many computers present]
Chief Joe
This is how we know who's a threat and who's not. How we know who's sleeping and who's awake. [Cartman runs away from the entrance, whips out a whistle and starts blowing it] How we know that...
Cartman
You think I'm fat and unimportant now?! [rips off his fake mustache] I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!
Alec Baldwin's new show
Alec Baldwin
Hi everybody, and welcome to my new show on MSNBC, "Free Pass with Alec Baldwin"
Cartman
["Your secret is out, NSA! And now that everyone knows what you're doing to Santa you can kiss your program goodbye!"]
At NSA Headquarters.
Cartman
You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
Cartman's house, evening. Cartman is weeping in his room at his computer when Liane walks in
Liane
Eric, honey, what's the matter?
Cartman
[through his tears] It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!
Liane
I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.
Cartman
Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! [cries hard now]
Liane
Honey, it's okay.
Cartman
It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! [weeps some more]
Liane
No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.
Cartman
I do toooo!
Liane
No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
Cartman
Okaaay. [she walks out and Cartman calms down] I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
Liane
Okay, hon.
Moments later the front door bell rings and Cartman goes to answer it in his bath robe, with cup of tea in hand. He opens the door and Butters is at the landing alone.
Butters
Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
Cartman
...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
Butters
It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
Cartman
[walks away, then stops] It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
Butters
[steps in and approaches Cartman] It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. [gives him a DMV booklet]
Cartman
What's this?
Butters
Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
Cartman
I can be forgiven?
Butters
Yes.
Cartman
For everything bad I've ever done?
Butters
Yes!
Cartman
And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
Butters
That's right.
Cartman
[wipes his forhead and sniffs] Thta's pretty kewl.
The DMV, day. Butters' group is back, and bigger than last time. Carl Weathers is a new member, Craig is a new member, and now someone else is joining. There's an organ playing, giving this a Revival feel. Everyone in the group is moving and clapping.
Butters
We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
Cartman
I do, I love my country!
Butters
Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
Cartman
I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
Butters
Hallelujah!
Group
Yaaaaay!
Paul
Do you want us to kick them out of here, Lar?
Larry
No... No, leave them alone. It's a nice change to see people happy here at the DMV. [Organ music fades out] Perhaps we here at the DMV can start changing as well. Perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope. Why, the DMV can be a place where people come to get things off their chests. Confess, yes, but also be told that they're worth something in this world! And then, DMVs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe. And when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness! Don't you see what this could lead to? Don't you see what we could become??
WMZ News 4 Breaking News
News Anchor
The DMV was shut down today after rampant allegations of sex with young boys. [in the picture over his shoulder are a bunch of DMV workers in handcuffs being led away by police. Four boys stand together nearby, naked and crying, with their hands over their privates.] The heads of the DMV were arrested and the director stated, quote: Hey, it came with the territory. With the DMV shut down, Americans have been asked to confess all wrongdoings at their nearest post office. [an arm appears and gives the anchorman a sheet of paper, then retracts] We've just received word that the US Postal service has been shut down due to rampant allegations of sex with young boys. It now appears that the only people who can be trusted with confessions and guidance is your local news station. WMZ News will be back in... a young boy.
End of Let Go, Let Gov


Informative Murder Porn
South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's classroom. Wendy is presenting her oral report.
Wendy
[reading from her yellow index cards] Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
Cartman
Boooo! [Wendy looks up and gets angry] Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!
Wendy
[returns to her report] Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
Cartman
Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
Wendy
[returns to her report, with her voice clearly getting more annoyed and explicit] The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
Cartman
Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo! [Wendy lowers her report down to her sidee-] Boo Wendy! Liar!
Wendy
Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
Cartman
I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
Wendy
Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please? [no reaction - he's rather engrossed in the book he's reading] Mr. Garrison?!
Mr. Garrison
[startled] Huh? Oh, oh, Wendy, uhhh, very nicely done. Thank you. Okay, next report, [Wendy looks betrayed] let's have uh, Peter Mullen.
Wendy
[extremely annoyed, goes to her seat] Ugh, Jesus! [Peter walks up and takes her place]
Peter
My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes! [whips out a remote control box and presses a button. A projector screen comes down behind him] Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide! [the screen stops] I'm talking of course about [presses another button and the first image comes up. It's an Investigation Discovery screenshot] murder porn!
Butters
Murder porn?
Cartman
That's more like it.
Peter
According to the Nielsen ratings, viewership in shows like "Cold Case Files," "Dateline: Murder," and "Deadly Affairs" is skyrocketing amongst married couples. The increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex, and innuendo, to make spousal murder more titillating. Shows like "Southern Fried Homicide," "Sinful Secrets," "On The Case with Paula Zahn." And it's all smut and it's garbage and it's [throws down his index cards] trash! [a few seconds later he clears his throat and gathers up his index cards] Your parents are watching this stuff! Go home and ask them! And as we ask them we must also ask ourselves, "If they're obsessed with this stuff, then how long? How long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes Mommy's head in with a brick?" [the class is speechless with mouths open. Only Cartman claps]
Stan's house, day. Stan comes home from school and walks up the stairs to his room when he hears noises coming out of his parents' room. Sharon is surely enjoying it. Stan, still wearing his backpack, walks up to the bedroom door and listens in. He knocks on the door
Randy
Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud. [some low rumbles are heard] Come on it. [Stan goes in. Randy is in his most relaxed pose in bed] Oh hey Stan, what's up? [Stan looks at the TV screen to his right]
TV screen.
Narrator
His wife is having sex with the neighbor. [a couple going at it in bed] And when her husband comes home, [the husband opens the bedroom door, the couple notices and stops.] he wants more than just a divorce. [the husband raises his gun and kills the boyfriend, than the wife. Sharon picks up the remote and switches channels]
Stan
You guys are watchin' murder porn?
Randy
...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
Sharon
Uh adults like documentaries.
Randy
Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
Stan
Okaaay. [turns around and walks out. Sharon switches back to the show]
Randy
Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
Later that night, in his room, Stan is sleeping. His phone rings and he picks up.
Stan
What's up dude?
Cartman
Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
Stan
Yhh, yeah, the first grader?
Cartman
You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
Stan
...What?!
Aaron's house crime scene. Police and ambulance are there, along with a news crew. Aaron is on the front lawn crying, and Stan shows up. The dead mom, who has a large knife jabbed into her head through her right eye, is wheeled out by the paramedics. As they pass by Aaron, he sees his mom's dead body and screams in sheer terror.
Sergeant Yates
Hey that kid should not be seeing this! [Aaron is still crying in despair, while an officer drops a blanket over him so he can't see]
Stan
What happened?
Dad
You're making a mistake! [he is naked and covered with blood, two officers haul him towards a police cruiser, while he struggles] Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack! [the officers put him in and close the back door. The boys don't believe what they've just seen]
Park County Community Center, day. A bunch of bicycles cover the parking area and kids can be heard inside. Kyle tries to hold court
Kyle
Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
Red
How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!
Clyde
The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
Butters
I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
Wendy
This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
Cartman
Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
Kyle
Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
The Marsh house, night. The Marshes are in bed watching ID.
Narrator
Tonight at 10, it's a tale of lust, seduction, and murder, on Sexy Betrayals. [a man and woman kiss. He holds a wedding ring in one hand, and a knife in the other] Then at 7, some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuits, [a couple kisses on the front porch, then the girlfriend shots her man point blank in the forehead, smiling] on Southern Fried Homicide. But now, get ready for lust, betrayal and murder, [another couple. The girl stabs the guy through the left eye] on Hot Load Case Files. [a woman is ready to unload on her man and the two other women he's in bed with]
Randy
Oh yeah! [he and Sharon strip down] Three of the best shows in a row!
Sharon
Is the lube over there?
Randy
Yeah, I got lube right here.
Sharon
Well get over here, big guy.
Randy
Yeah-hah! [he moves over to her and they start making out. He leaves the lube near the edge of the bed. A three-tone chime is heard. Randy looks over and reads the screen]
The screen reads: "CONTENT BLOCKED. To unlock, answer the security question: 'How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?'
Randy
What the? [sits up. The lube falls off the bed] What the hell? [tries to change channels, but they all say the same thing. Moments later he's on the phone with his cable service.] Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says "How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
Stan's room, night. His door is open. Randy walks into view, wearing only slippers, but stays in the hallway. Because he's naked, he's covering his privates
Randy
Stan. Stan! [Stan wakes up, his eyes half-closed] How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
Stan
[miffed] What?
Randy
What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
Stan
You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. [closes his eyes]
Randy
Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid! [thinking a bit. Stan opens his eyes] I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot! [Stan closes his eyes again] Stan? [Stan opens his eyes] You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! [goes back to his room. Stan rolls his eyes and goes back to sleep]
Get Cable offices, day. Inside, in the waiting area, is a group of angry, locked-out adults, including Gerald, Stuart, Stephen and Linda, and Mrs. Tweak.
Stephen
Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!
Mrs. Tweak
How are they able to do this with their smartphones?
Randy
It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company! [Stuart returns from a meeting with the cable company] What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?
Stuart
No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.
Randy
What?! We'll see about this! [storms into the office] Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
Cable Guy
I'm sorry sir. If you need it now, perhaps you should switch to another cable company. [tauntingly] Ohhh there's not another cable company, is there? [begins to rub his nipples in circles] Ohhh, that's right, we're the only one in town.
Randy
Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!
Cable Guy
As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box.
Randy
[relieved somewhat] Oh. Well okay, great.
Cable Guy
[begins to process the request on his computer] We'll just need to find a window of time you can be home... How about between the hours of 6 am and 3 pm all of November?
Randy
NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
Cable Guy
[begins to taunt again] Oh, you can't? [begins rubbing his nipples through his shirt] Jeez that's too bad. You need to be home for the technician. Have you thought of switching to DirecTV?
Randy
I can't afford DirecTV.
Cable Guy
Oh, you can't? [rips off some patches covering his nipples off his shirt and begins rubbing his nipples directly] Jeez, that's terrible. Then I guess you just have to work within our time windows. [squeezes his nipples. Randy just glares at him and walks out]
Stephen
Well? Any luck?
Randy
No, just the usual cable-company stuff.
Mrs. Tweak
Oh well, guess we'll just have to live without our informative crime drama.
Stephen
No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?
Randy
I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
Stephen
We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.
In front of a kid's house, day. Randy knocks on the door. A boy holding a lollipop answers the door.
Boy
Hello?
Randy
Hi. Corey Lanskin?
Corey
Yes?
Randy
We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
Corey
Fuck off! [shuts the door on Randy. The adults are stunned and look at each other. Randy knocks on the door again, twice. Corey answers the door again, still suspicious]
Randy
Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!
Corey
You was told wrong, mistuh! I'm just a simple kid with a simple passion for simple things!
Randy
We have a hundred ounces of silver. [Stuart leans to his left a bit and shows off a box]
Corey
[looks right, then left, and talks in a serious British accent] Wipe your feet and turn off your cell phones. [goes inside. Randy looks back at the other adults, then wipes his shoes off on the welcome mat and goes in. The other adults wipe their shoes off and go on in.]
Corey's basement, moments later. He's got two long tables in there, with three computers on each table, all loaded up and ready for Minecraft training.
Corey
[pacing back and forth between the tables explaining the game] Next we're going to select an empty world. Selecting an empty world will begin with you being dropped onto a beach. Now you're free to roam around and start punching trees!
Gerald
Punching trees?
Randy
Why, why would we punch trees?
Corey
Just use your fucking brain! How do you get wood? [Randy isn't sure] 'Ow do you get wood?!
Randy
[nervously] Watching informative murder porn?
Corey
NOO NOO, in this Minecraft forest, how do you get wood?!
Randy
Puh, punching trees?
Corey
Riiight. You punch the trees to get the wood, you get the wood to build a cabin.
Randy
Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
Corey
You are playing the game; this is the game!
Randy
...I don't get it.
Corey
That's because you're thinkin' like a dad. Minecraft, it don't got no winner. It don't got no objective. You just fuckin' build an' shit. And seein' if other things can come and knock it down. Now, let's click on the inventory, and let's filter through the skin!
Randy
Yes ah, I'm getting it now.
Gerald
You are?
Randy
No.
The Marsh house, night. Sharon is in bed looking bored.
Sharon
Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.
Randy
[at his computer playing away] I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.
Sharon
I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
Randy
Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
Sharon
We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
Randy
No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?
Sharon
[settling in] Well I'm going to sleep, Randy.
Randy
Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
South Park Elementary, hallways, day. Stan and Kyle walk down the hall
Jimmy
There he is. Hey Kyle! [arrives with Craig and Tweek] The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
Kyle
What? How do you know?
Tweek
I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
Craig
It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
Stan
That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
Cartman
You guys? [Stan and Kyle turn to face him. He's at the end of the hall] You guys, you'd better get over here.
Stan
What?
Cartman
Butters' dad killed his mom. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in disbelief]
Around the corner, down another hall. Butters is sitting on the floor crying. Around him are Bebe, Wendy, Kenny consoling him, and Cartman. Stan, Kyle, Craig, Tweek, and Jimmy arrive and a few other kids gather around
Stan
Butters, what happened?
Butters
[through his tears] I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled "Hey, watch out for the Creepers!" but she fell!
Kyle
Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?
Butters
Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well! [Mr. Mackey happens along] I was trapped down there all night!
Mr. Mackey
Butters, your dad threw you down a well?
Stan
In Minecraft.
Mr. Mackey
Well what the hell is that?
Butters
I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
Kyle
[turns left] That's it. [walks a bit] That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
Stan
Whattaya mean?
Kyle
Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. [dramatic flourish]
The Marsh house, dawn. Two officers knock on his door. He answers it in his bathrobe
Randy
Yes?
Officer 1
Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?
Randy
No, what happened?
Officer 1
Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees.
Randy
Punched his trees, huh?
Officer 1
Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
Randy
Huh. [puts his hands on his hips] That's weird.
Officer 1
What were you doing last night?
Randy
I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
Officer 2
I play the banjo too.
Officer 1
Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well.
Randy
Will do, officer. Will... do... [the officers turn and leave]
Park County Community Center, day. The kidds are back inside, clamoring. Kyle is at the podium, and Stan stands next to him
Kyle
Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
Cartman
Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! [the kids clamor for a few seconds]
Craig
I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!
Clyd
Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
Kyle
You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
Cartman
And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
Wendy
I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
Cartman
Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
Stan
It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. [police sirens are heard]
Officer 3
All right, that's enough. Come on out and there won't be any trouble. [the kids pour out of the rec center and into some bright spotlights.] Give it up, Stotch. You've nowhere to run.
Butters
Huh?
Stephen
I'll never give up! [the kids look up, and the next camera shows a makeshift castle built over the rec center, made of blocks of wood with pictures all over them] I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!
Randy
[steps forward carrying a large hammer] Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!
Stephen
Aw, go to hell, you griefer!
Cartman
Alright, we've gotta do something.
Corey's house, day. Kyle knocks on Corey's door. Stan, Cartman and Kenny are with him.
Corey
[in a trembling voice] Hello?
Kyle
Corey Lanskin?
Corey
Eh yes?
Kyle
We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
Corey
[sucks on his lollipop] Whaaa? What's a, what's a "Minequaf"?
Stan
Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
Corey
Oh no, please don't be angry. My mommy's always angry. "Get back in the meat locker!" "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!" But she loves me, right? Mommy loves me?
Kyle
Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
Corey
Ohhhkay. [goes back inside] Bye. [closes the door. The boys turn around and leave, but Cartman stops on the walkway. A few seconds later the other three boys return]
Stan
What, dude?
Cartman
Something he said. Did you hear him? He said "Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"
Stan
So?
Cartman
You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
Meanwhile, in Corey's basement, new players at the the computers. Only four of them this time, including Craig's parents and Clyde's father.
Corey
Now that you've built a workbench it's time to build somethin' that will take care of all those fuckin' sheep! [the boys have found the basement and come down the stairs] Just stop thinkin' with your grown-up brains and start usin' your-
Stan
Aha! [the boys reach the floor]
Corey
Oh shit! [the adults quickly leave]
Kenny
(I knew you're up to something!)
Cartman
Son of a bitch! [grabs Corey by the collar] Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
Corey
Kids gotta find some way to make a livin', don't 'e?
Stan
You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
Corey
What? You mean like Investigation Discovery?
Kyle
So you know it.
Corey
Yeah, I've seen that stuff. [Cartman releases him] "'Oo The Bleep Did I Marry?", "True Crime with Aphrodite Jones". Real sick shit. Your parents watch that stuff?
Kyle
We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
Corey
Your problem ain't with me, mates. Sure, one or two people might act out what they see in video games, but cable television? [takes out a cigarette and lighter and lights up the cigarette, then starts smoking.] People copy everything they see people do on cable. You're goin' about this all wrong. You wanna protect your family? You're gonna have to go fight the cable company.
The cable company, day. The boys walk up to the cable guy
Cable Guy
Hey guys, can I help you?
Kyle
Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
Cable Guy
[taunting] Ohhh, you don't want cable anymore?
Stan
No no, [whips out a list and reads it] just ID Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
Cable Guy
You don't like paying for all the channels? [begins rubbing his nipples through his shirt] Ohh, our company actually packages channels together.
Stan
Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
Cable Guy
Oh I'm sorry. Our company doesn't work that way. [lowers his hands as if to look up something] You want me to give you the number of a different cable company that can- [goes back to rubbing his nipples] Oh wait, we're it, aren't we? [rips off the patches and rubs his nipples again] Dangit, I guess you have to deal with our packages.
Kyle
Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
Cable Guy
Oh, sure. Hey David?
David
[arrives] Hi, is there a problem here? [rips off the patches on his shirt and prepares to rub]
Stan
We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
David
[taunting. Both men are now rubbing their nipples] Ohhh you have to pay for the bundle. You can't just pay for what you wanna watch. Darn it.
Kyle
You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
Cable Guy
I guess if you don't wanna be [lowers his left hand from his nipple so that David starts rubbing it with his right hand. He in turn begins to rub David's right nipple with his left hand] forced to pay for Oprah, you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether.
Kyle
Fine, [folds his arms over his chest] then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
David
Hey Mitch? When can you get out to shut off some cable boxes?
Mitch
[at his office rubbing his nipples] Oh man, it's gonna be like three weeks. There's a whole plug I have to pull out; it's like four inches long.
David
[now rubbing both of the cable guy's nipples, while the cable guy rubs his left nipple now] Three weeks, huh? Okay, is three weeks from now okay with you guys?
Stan
No, that's way too long!
Cable Guy
Oh it is?
David
Oh Jeez, that's terrible.
Stan
Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other! [the men stop rubbing] Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
David
Say... say that last part again?
Stan
What?
David
Well what was the last part you said?
Stan
I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
David
Nono, the part about your parents not getting the channels easily?
Stan
I... said it would really bum them out.
David
How... [he and the cable guy being to rub their nipples again] How much would it bum them out?
A screen read "PLEASE STAND BY FOR AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE"
Announcer
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by for an important message from the president of your local cable company.
President
Hello. In an effort to comfort the anguished cries or children everywhere, your local cable company has decided to drop all networks that sexualize spousal homicides from regular programming. Customers still wishing to view true-crime networks will now need to purchase a separate package [pulls back his coat and rips some patches off his dress shirt] which will require a technician to service your cable box every night from 2 to 3 am. and must include the purchase of 300 channels in Portuguese. We realize this may be an inconvenience to you, and we hope you will voice ALL your concerns to us, because at your local cable company the customer is always... our bitch.
The Marsh breakfast nook, morning. Stan is doing some homework at the table. Randy is mad and isn't talking to anyone, and he has his arms crossed over his chest. Sharon is washing dishes
Randy
Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
Stan
Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
Randy
[gets up angrily from his chair] I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off! [Sharon stops washing the dishes and leaves the kitchen. Randy notices and follows her with his eyes] Oh crap.
In the living room. Randy appears at the kitchen doorway
Randy
Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. [approaches her]
Sharon
No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.
Randy
[puts his arms on her shoulders] No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
The world of Minecraft. A high cliff is shown, with a waterfall and mountain goats. At the foot of this cliff is a lake and a park. A fire pit is nearby, lit and roaring. Randy's Minecraft avatar shows up
Randy
Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?
Sharon
I'm here, Randy.
Randy
It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. [presents a gem]
Sharon
Diamonds. [takes them] They're beautiful
Randy
Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
Sharon
I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.
Randy
Oh yeah? What's that? [Sharon whips out an axe and jams it into Randy's forehead] AAAGH! [Randy falls on his side and dies. In real life...] Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?![Sharon is smiling]
Sharon
Sorry. I couldn't resist.
Randy
Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!
Sharon
Oh I did! That felt really great.
Randy
Felt great?
Sharon
[getting sensuous] Yeah...
Randy
Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.
Sharon
Okay. [hours later, Stan comes home from school. He comes up the stairs wearing his backpack and hears his parents having a good time in their room. He walks over and goes in without knocking] Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!
Randy
That felt so good!
Sharon
My turn again.
Randy
Okay, hang on.
Sharon
I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
Randy
Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.
Sharon
You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! [CHUNK!]
Randy
OH! Ohoho, you bitch! [Stan looks down, then turns around and walks out] Ohohunh.
Sharon
Oh I love you, Randy.
Randy
I love you too babe. [CHUNK! She got him again] OH!
End of Informative Murder Porn

World War Zimmerman
South Park Elementary, day, the school halls. Token is at his locker switching books when Cartman comes 'round the corner
Cartman
Hey Token! [walks up to Token] What's up, bro?
Token
Nothing.
Cartman
"Nothin'" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks. [sniffs] Everything good with you?
Token
Yeah.
Cartman
Sweet. [Jimmy walks over and Cartman notices him] Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?
Jimmy
Uh, I'm just gettin' ready for cla-
Cartman
Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President. [Jimmy walks away and Token is done at his locker] About time. [Stan and Kyle stop to watch]
Stan
Is he doing it again?
Kyle
He's doing it a-gain.
Cartman
Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? [Token puts one last book in before closing his locker]
Token
I uhhh, have band practice.
Cartman
God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess. [makes a fist with his left hand and straightens out his arm toward Token] Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. [Token reluctantly makes a fist with his right hand and bumps Cartman's fist with it. He leaves, and Cartman moves on in a happy mood, stopping by Stan and Kyle]
Stan
Cartman, are you feeling alright?
Cartman
Yeah, I feel great. Why? [looks back] You think something's wrong? [moves on, not smiling]
Herbert Garrison's classroom, later in the day. He's teaching about the French Revolution by way of Les Misérables, on the chalkboard.
Herbert Garrison
Alright, now the French Revolution was basically started by a young man named Marius. [underlines the name], who only knew Jean Valjean as an older man, and uh- [Cartman interrupts him with a grunt] ...uh, the French government at the time was led by Javert, who was trying to-
Cartman
Mister! [Herbert Garrison turns around] No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt! [wakes up violently and looks bewildered. Token is stunned, and Herbert Garrison, with his arms crossed, is not pleased.] Hey Token. What's up, bro? [makes a fist and extends it towards Cartman] Fist bump? [Token is unmoved and upset]
Moments later, at Mr. Mackey's office...
Mr. Mackey
Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
Cartman
It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
Mr. Mackey
And why do you think Token is a tickin' time bomb?
Cartman
He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
Mr. Mackey
Do you think he blames you for somethin'?
Cartman
But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
Mr. Mackey
Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Token?
Cartman
No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
Mr. Mackey
Well Eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. M'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. M'kay?
Cartman
M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me.
Cartman
M'kay.
Cartman's room, night. He's having nightmares.
Cartman
No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
Cartman's dream, morning. He voices all the characters in it. A family is seated in a breakfast nook in a kitchen. The girls are giggling.
Karin
[serving pancakes] Eat your breakfast, girls. [turns around to put the pan back on the stove]
Rachel
Where's Daddy?
Karin
You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry. [the girls giggle and the older one notices someone]
Rachel
Daddy!
Gerry
Good morning, girls. [walks in fully dressed, with a cup of coffee already in hand.] Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. [Karin walks over and kisses him]
Karin
How did I get such a perfect husband?
Gerry
How did I get such a beautiful wife?
Rachel
I love you, Dad.
Gerry
I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.
Karin
Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.
News report inside the dream. Gerry turns around to see the TV
Reporter
Today apparently will be the day! CNN has just received word that a verdict in the George Zimmerman trial is expected to come at any moment! Zimmerman is accused of shooting Trayvon Martin, and a jury will now decide his fate.
Constance
Daddy, who is Trayvon Martin?
Gerry
[turns around] Nobody. L-let's just get you girls to school.
Cartman's dream, downtown, some minutes later. He's on a one-way street with a bunch of other cars all trying to move, but stuck. Somehow, the family remains chipper
Gerry
Is it bigger than a bread box?
Rachel
What's a bread box, Dad?
Constance
Heehee, Dad is so kewl.
Karin
You can say that again.
Gerry
[getting worried] Why aren't we moving? What's gong on? [turns on the radio to 106.7 FM and Michael Bublé's "It's A Beautiful Day" comes out of the speakers. The family sways along to the beat. A news report comes on the air]
Reporter
We interrupt this cool song for a news bulletin. A verdict has just been handed down in the case of George Zimmerman. In a shocking turn of events, the jury has found George Zimmerman not guilty!
Gerry
Oh my God. [fleeing white people run by his car, quickly overtaken by pissed-off black people]
Reporter
Many African-Americans are outraged by the verdict, and they are most likely about to go totally nanners. [some of them surround the car. One of them punches a window and cracks it, a second cracks the passenger window with his head, a third crawls up on the hood and breaks the windshield with his head, sticking his head inside the car]
Gerry
AAAAAH!
Protester
Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
Gerry
Let's bail! [steps on the gas and runs over a protester, ripping him to shreds. His car runs into another car and the protester on his hood flies off.] Everyone get out of the car! Go! [the family gets out and runs through the rioting crowd. They climb up a fire escape and onto the roof of a building, then look down over the riot. What they see is amazing: African-Americans converge and climb the side of the building in a great mass of humanity. Some of them fall back towards the street, but the mass gets closer and closer to the roof] Oh my god RUN! [they turn left and come face to face with... Token] WAAH! Token. No, Token, we had nothing to do with this. I know you're pissed off, but but be reasonable!
Token
Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
Gerry
No! Nonono! [Token lunges at him] Nooo! [Cartman wakes up, touches himself to make sure he's there, and chuckles nervously]
South Park Elementary, day, the school halls. Token is at his locker switching books when Cartman comes 'round the corner. This time, he looks beat and walks slowly. He sees Token and walks towards him. He didn't get much sleep, and he sounds it
Cartman
Hey Token? How are you doing?
Token
I'm good.
Cartman
That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends. [puts his left fist forward] Fist bump. [leans to his left a little] Fist bump. [Token closes his locker and hurries away]
Mr. Garrison's classroom, later in the day. Cartman is having nightmares again.
Cartman
No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
Token
Okay, really?
Cartman
No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! [wakes up]
Mr. Mackey's office, some minutes later.
Mr. Mackey
Now Eric, whatever it is you and Token are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? The problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. Agreed?
Cartman
Agreed.
Mr. Mackey
Okay. Token, come on in, please. [the door opens and Token walks in, closing it behind him. Token takes a seat next to Cartman]
Cartman
Hoh boy, here we go.
Mr. Mackey
Token, I've been talkin' with Eric and he's really upset that you two aren't gettin' along. You have some things you wanna say, Eric?
Cartman
[after a few seconds] Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?
Token
...What jury?
Cartman
This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
Mr. Mackey
Okay Token, what are your feelings about that?
Token
[looks at Eric for a few seconds, then answers] I don't know what to say.
Cartman
I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem? [pulls out his poem and begins] It's called "I Was Not The Bullet." [clears his throat]
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
"Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?"
I was not the verdict.

Token
This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.
Cartman
It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.

[folds his poem up and puts it away.]
Token
Can I go back to class now?
Mr. Mackey
Eric, do you feel better about all this?
Cartman
Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
Mr. Mackey
Okay, thanks Token. [Token gets up and leaves the office]
Cartman
It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
South Park Elementary, day, the gym. The students are assembled there. The cheerleaders take the court. Among them is Lorraine, who has previously been mocked for her clothes
Cheerleaders
We are Cows, proud and true! Come on, South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows!
Principal Victoria
Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song, [Nicole sits down next to Token] based on his award-winning poem, "I Was Not The Bullet," with backup music by Butters Stotch. [Butters walks up, takes the mic, and starts beatboxing. Cartman walks up and starts rapping]
Cartman (Butters)
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the jury, so don't blame me, son!
James my man was wrong (It's not our fault). James my man was wrong (It's not Eric's fault).
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.

White people say Ho-oh!

The kids
Ho-oh.

Cartman
Black people say He-ey! [Token and Nicole stay quiet] Cool. White people say Ho ho! [Token and Nicole begin to get mad]

The kids
Ho ho!

Cartman
Black people say Hey hey hey! [no reply] Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say "I don't blame the white people. No no no!"

Token
[stands up in defiance] Alright, that's enough! [Butters stops and looks, then gets dismayed] You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!
Cartman
Token, calm down.
Token
What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
Cartman
Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! [throws his mic down and runs off]
The neighborhood. Cartman runs into view, rounds the corner and runs towards home
Cartman
Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [runs inside his house] Mom it's starting! We've gotta go! [runs up to his room and opens a drawer. He rifles through it looking for something] Come on, come on! [finds a red safety box with "BRAD PITT SURVIVAL GEAR" printed on the lid and on the panel under the clasp. He opens it and pulls out a gun and a Brad Pitt costume. He puts the costume on, takes the gun, and runs out into the street] Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! [nearby, a couple is on their front lawn. The man is trimming bushes while his wife is shoveling snow by the front door.]
Woman
Does that little boy have a gun?
Man
Get inside. [drops his shears and heads for the door]
Woman
But-
Man
Get inside! [they both go inside. Cartman crosses the stret and a car almost runs him over, but he sidesteps the car and holds his gun out. The car stops and he gets inside]
Cartman
[frantically] Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
Nelly's Mom
What's going on?!
Cartman
Get to an airport!
Nelly's Mom
An airport?! But...?
Cartman
We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! [she presses the pedal and takes off]
The airport, later.
Announcer
Now calling rows 10 through 30 for boarding.
Cartman
The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! [enters the tunnel]
Passenger 1
An outbreak? [covers his mouth with his sweater]
Passenger 2
Which one?
Cartman
Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go! [Nelly's Mom rushes into the plane. Three black security guards appear] Oh my God! [closes the plane's door and locks it. The guards try to get in, but Cartman holds the handle down with all his might]
Pilot
My God, what's going on out there?
Cartman
The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! [the plane takes off moments later]
The airplane, now in the air and safe to walk around in
Copilot
Maybe now you can tell us what the hell is going on?!
Cartman
The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
Passenger 3
What contagion? My wife didn't get on the plane. [to the copilot] Take this plane back to Denver!
Cartman
You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! [the passengers all take their seats.]
The control tower. Everyone there is running around trying to figure out how a plane got off without authorization
Captain
Alright what the hell is going on here?!
Worker 1
We don't know anything. First there was talk of a hijacking, then reports of an outbreak of some kind.
Worker 2
Confirmed report of panic in a rural town in the Colorado Rockies!
Worker 3
Sir, the pilot of flight 82 wants an update. They're asking permission to land.
Captain
Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!
Worker 4
[walks up with a book] Sir, you'd better look at this. This was found in the airport lavatory. It seems to be a survival guide of some kind.
Captain
Survival of what?
Worker 4
From the looks of it, a contagion outbreak of the worst kind. [the book shows a page of black zombies attacking everyone else]
Captain
Oh my God.
Pilot
DA43 to tower, please advise! [hangs up the mic] Damnit! They aren't telling me anything!
Copilot
Do you think it's a virus?
Pilot
Virus, bacteria, either way we're all dead! Find out if he thinks it's safe to land in Los Angeles.
Copilot
What about Los Angeles? Can we take the plane to Los Angeles?
Cartman
Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. [points to the island on a map.]
Copilot
This plane won't make it to Iceland!
Passenger 3
You got a better idea, asshole?!
Cartman
Everyone quiet! I have to think!
Nelly's Mom
Yes, let him think!
Cartman
I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. [heads off to the restroom. He sees the "vacant" sign and opens the door, only to see a black man on the toilet]
Occupant
Oh, I'm just finishing up.
Cartman
Nah! [shuts the door and jumps back, then throws everything he can at the door so the occupant can't exit]
Occupant
Hey!
Cartman
[running back to his seat] One of them is in the back!
Nelly's Mom
What?!
Passenger 3
What do you mean?!
Copilot
Everyone just calm down! We have to stay in control! [the occupant is still trying to get out, and everyone on the plane faces the lavatory door. The occupant begins to grunt and growl]
Passenger 4
[at one of the doors] I won't become one of them! [forces it open. It rips away, and he flies out. Other things fly out behind them. The other passengers and crew hang on for dear life. The occupant finally exits the lavatory]
Copilot
Shoot it! [instead of waiting for Cartman to shoot the occupant, he takes Cartman's gun and shoots him. The occupant ducks and the bullet ricochets a few times. It hits the ceiling, which causes an explosion.]
South Park Elementary playground, day. Butters is skipping rope with a bunch of girls while Stan and Kyle play catch the football with some other guys
Girls
Engine engine #9 running down Chicago Line, if the train should jump the track do you want your money back? [the plane appears and only Stan notices it falling to its doom]
Butters
Yes.
Girls
Y-E-S spells yes- [the plane hits a mountain top, then breaks apart as it goes down the mountain.]
Mr. Mackey's office, some time later
Mr. Mackey
Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.
Token
He's just out looking for trouble.
Mr. Mackey
Well that's your side of it, Token, but you know Eric has his side as well. Have you thought about maybe writin' him a poem? M'kay? Write E- write Eric a poem, tell him how you feel. [smoke from the plane crash rises behind the mountains] You know, m'kay? Well I'm tellin' you, Token, you let it go, and he'll let it go, and it'll all be fine. Can ya?
The crash site. Cartman comes to and leaves the wreckage. Nelly's Mom is nearby, and she's calling someone
Nelly's Mom
No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere. [the call drops] Matt? Matt?! [notices Cartman and walks up to him to explain] My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.
Cartman
Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
Pilot
[barely alive] Help! Help me! [Cartman runs up to him] Please, I have two little girls in Chicago. Please find them!
Cartman
It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
Pilot
Then you have to stop it.
Nelly's Mom
Yes!
Pilot
And there must be... a Patient Zero... The person it all starts from.
Cartman
His name is Token.
Nelly's Mom
We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!
Cartman
I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
Pilot
You have to! You have to be strong. If you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it. [coughs up blood] Promise me! Promise... me!
Cartman
[sighs] Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
Pilot
Thank you-wait, what? [sits up, but dies a few seconds later]
Nelly's Mom
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Cartman
We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
Nelly's Mom
Yes!
Cartman
[takes her hand] Come on! [they leave the crash site]
Butters' house, day. He's watching TV from the sofa
Reporter
First, a wave of 911 calls about a virus, and now a plane has apparently gone down in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Is this the beginning of the end?
Butters
Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
Reporter
The government is looking for a Patient Zero, going only off of this sketch which was found in a notebook at the airport.
[Butters suddenly recognizes the person in the picture] Anyone with information regarding Patient Zero is asked to contact the authorities immediately.

Butters
Holy Moly.
Jimbo's Guns, day. Cartman and Nelly's Mom reach it and go inside. Cartamn closes the door
Jimbo
Can I help you?
Cartman
Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes! [walks up to the counter] I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
Jimbo
Alright, you want a rifle! [turns around and takes a rifle from the wall, then turns back and hands it to Cartman] well, like this .22 caliber. [Cartman looks it over, and Jimbo puts his hand on his hip] What is it you intend to shoot?
Cartman
A person. [Nelly's Mom looks around]
Jimbo
...You mean a person who's threatening you?
Cartman
Threatening all of us!
Nelly's Mom
Please, please hurry! It's important!
Jimbo
Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.
Cartman
What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
Jimbo
You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a "stand your ground" law.
Cartman
Stand my ground?
Nelly's Mom
Please! We're running out of time!
Jimbo
See now with a "stand your ground" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.
Cartman
Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
Jimbo
No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a "stand your ground" law, like Florida.
Cartman
[walks away from the counter] This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?! [his eyes light up] Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token, [turns around] but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
Jimbo
So long as they're threatening you.
Nelly's Mom
What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!
Cartman
The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
Cartman and Nelly's Mom are back at Denver Airport, and the sequence of events from the first plane crash repeat themselves here: Cartman and Nelly's Mom run into the airplane
Cartman
Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go![the plane takes off. Once in the air...] Find the closest airport in Florida! [injects himself with something]
Flight Attendant
This plane is going to Baltimore.
Cartman
If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left! [everyone sits down] Black guy in the back! [the plane crashes into the Everglades. Cartman and Nelly's Mom make it out of the wreckage] Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
Florida, evening. A weather-beaten yellow truck crashes into a state sign. Cartman and Nelly's Mom get out and meet behind the truck bed. Cartman opens up his bag.
Cartman
Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. [hands her a black sweater, which she puts on as she walks onto the roadway]
Nelly's Mom
What are we going to do?
Cartman
I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
Nelly's Mom
What if he attacks us first?
Cartman
Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
Nelly's Mom
I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d- [a Moov-It truck slams into her and carries her body away. Cartman is confused]
Florida, day. The camera pans down and lands on the Zimmerman residence. A family is seated in the breakfast nook in the kitchen. The girls are giggling.
Mom
[serving pancakes] Eat your breakfast, girls. [turns around to put the pan back on the stove]
Older Daughter
Where's Daddy?
Mom
You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry. [the girls giggle and the older one notices someone]
Older Daughter
Daddy!
George Zimmerman
Good morning, girls. [walks in fully dressed, with a cup of coffee already in hand.] Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. [Mom walks over and kisses him]
Mom
How did I get such a perfect husband, Geroge Zimmerman?
George Zimmerman
And how did I get such a beautiful wife?
Older Daughter
I love you, Dad.
George Zimmerman
I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.
Mom
Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.
Reporter
[on TV] Is there any hope for stopping the zombie apocalypse? [George Zimmerman turns around to see the news] CNN has just received word that the government has learned the identity of Patient Zero. [the drawing of Token is shown] The nine year old threat to humanity has been tracked down, and measures are being taken to stop him.
Younger Daughter
Daddy, what's a Patient Zero? [a knock is heard at the front door. George Zimmerman turns left and walks to the front door. He opens it and two federal agents face him]
Agent 1
Hello, Mr. Zimmerman. Your country needs you.
George Zimmerman
What do you need from me?
Agent 1
We... [holds up a photo of Token] need you to shoot a young African-American for us.
George Zimmerman
[turns and walks away] I gave that up.
Agent 2
You're the best, Zimmerman. We just need you to do it one more time, for the security of the world!
George Zimmerman
Damnit, I have a wife and kids now.
Agent 1
Then do it for your family! [Cartman appears on the sidewalk, wearing black face paint and a black sweater] This is about protecting people, Zimmerman! Keeping our streets safe so that our children are free to go out... [his voice trails off as Zimmerman focuses on something else]
George Zimmerman
Something's wrong. [quickly turns around and sees the stranger] Look out! [grabs the gun from one of the agent and fires it twice. Cartman's arm gets hit by a bullet and he falls to the ground]
Agent 1
My God, I didn't even see him. [the other agent walks over to the body]
Agent 2
Nice work, Zimmerman. [George turns and walks over to his family]
George Zimmerman
Are you guys okay?
Older Daughter
What was that, Daddy?
George Zimmerman
More needless violence.
Agent 1
Nonsense, you did what you had to. You're a hero.
George Zimmerman
That may be true, but I'll have to live with this the rest of my life. Even though I'll be walking around a free man.
Agent 2
[notices the paint coming off Cartman's face] Hey, wait a minute. This kid isn't black, he's white.
George Zimmerman
Wait, what?
A courtroom. This is a speedy trial. The judge announces his decision with two blows of the gavel
Judge
Guilty!
The electic chair. George Zimmerman is tied down to it and the operator brings the switch down for three seconds, then raises it. He lowers it again for two seconds and raises it. Then he does this three times more for a fraction of a second each, then a final time for half a second.
A news report
Reporter
The zombie apocalypse... is over. All the panic, crashing planes and chaos appear to have, for some reason, died with George Zimmerman. And as for the little boy who was so mercilessly gunned down? [a picture of Cartman smiling appears, his left shoulder in a bandage, his right hand giving a thumbs up] Although he survived the shooting, his wishes are to remain anonymous, giving the hospital only the nickname... "Brad Pitt." ...But cooler.
At one of the boys' homes. Eight of them are sitting around watching the news: Clyde, Kyle, Stan, and Craig on the sofa; Jimmy, Kenny and Butters in front of Clyde, and Token sitting by himself near Craig.
Stan
That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
Kyle
Yeah, that sucked.
Butters
Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? [Token just stands up, looks at the other guys, and walks out. Butters' smile fades]
On the street, day. Cartman is in the distance, looking at Token. Token notices and faces him
Cartman
Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
Token
You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!
Cartman
Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
Token
So what?!
Cartman
Uh oh. [brings forth a can of red spray paint and paints a red circle around himself in the middle of the street] Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
Token
Fuck you!
Cartman
Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea. [makes a fist with his right hand and puts it forth] First bump? [Token stays put] Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. [Token walks up to the red circle, then bends forward and offers his left fist. Then he steps into the circle and Cartman quickly shoots him]
Token
Oh! [falls on his face]
Cartman
That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine. [drags Token's body into the circle] Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. [smiles when no one answers.]
Cartman's dream, day. He's sailing off in his Brad Pitt costume, with his dream family looking on from shore.
Gerry's Daughters
Daddy!
Gerry
We're safe, girls! Daddy did it!
Mr. Garrison's class, day. Token is absent. Cartman wakes up screaming... during class. Mr. Garrison crosses his arms again
Cartman
Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
Kyle
You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
Cartman
Yeah. So bad.
Kyle
That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
Cartman
Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
Kyle
You're a murderer.
Cartman
You interrupt people when they talk.
Mr. Mackey
[over the PA system] Eric Cartman to the counselor's office please.
Cartman
Oh man! [walks out of the room]
Mr. Mackey's office, moments later. Cartman walks in. Token and Cartman immediately notice each other
Cartman
Oh boy.
Mr. Mackey
Have a seat, Eric. Now boys, I for one am sick and tired of this little feud you're having, okay? This has clearly gone too far, and you owe each other an apology or you're gettin' detention!
Token
An apology?! He shot me!
Mr. Mackey
Well he was technically standing his ground, Token.
Cartman
Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
Token
[stands on his chair] Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!
Cartman
Token, calm down.
Token
And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
Cartman
Oh God, here we go again! [runs out of the office in a panic]
End of World War Zimmerman

Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers
Henrietta's room, night. She's holding a dramatic Edgar Allan Poe reading there with her fellow Goths. On a small table nearby sits three candles, two books, a statue, and a black and white picture of a freak show with a sign on it: HUMAN FREAK EXHIBIT
Henrietta
So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.

Pete
Whoa... That's pretty hardcore. [taps some ashes off his cigarette into his ashtray, then flips his hair]
Michael
That's real pain right there. [taps some ashes off his cigarette into his ashtray]
Henrietta
That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore. [Mrs. Biggle knocks three times on Henrietta's door, then opens it]
Mrs. Biggle
[sing song] Henrietta, sweetie.
Henrietta
[glares at her] Shut up, Mom! Go away!
Mrs. Biggle
Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess.
Henrietta
Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!
Mrs. Biggle
We'll be waiting in the living room.
Henrietta
[rolls her eyes] God, she just never stops!
The living room, moments later.
Mrs. Biggle
Oh goodness I am so nervous. [Henrietta enters the living room]
Henrietta
What?!
Mr. Biggle
Have a seat, Henrietta. [Henrietta sits on the chair]
Mrs. Biggle
Oh, a little family chit-chaaat.
Henrietta
Shut up, Mom!
Mr. Biggle
Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I have been concerned about your behavior for some time.
Henrietta
Are we really doing this again?!
Mr. Biggle
We've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into, but we've finally had some counseling, and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is... emo.
Henrietta
What?!
Mrs. Biggle
But Daddy and I love our little muffin, even if she's emo or not.
Henrietta
I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!
Mr. Biggle
Do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart?
Mrs. Biggle
Like calling Mommy Demon Jizz.
Mr. Biggle
So listen, sweetie, we've found a camp. [her mom brings out a brochure]
Henrietta
Noo...
Mr. Biggle
A camp which is for troubled kids like you, and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility.
Henrietta
[stands up, ready to leave the room] I'm not going to any fucking camp!
Mr. Biggle
It's for two weeks, and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges.
Henrietta
I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!
Mrs. Biggle
Theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes.
The loading dock at the side of the school, day, the goths' usual gathering spot
Pete
And that's all you know? what else did she say?
Michael
She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks.
Pete
[flips hair] Oh my God, for two weeks?
Firkle
Is she at the camp now?
Michael
I don't know. [scrolls through his text messages] She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark.
Pete
[softly] Whoa...
Firkle
That's fucking creepy man.
Michael
[gets up and walks a bit] I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child.
Child Protective Services, day. The three remaining Goths go to talk to a worker there
Worker
Alright now, you say that you witnessed your friend being abused by her parents.
Michael
Yes. They called her an emo.
Worker
What's wrong with that?
Michael
Emos suck! Their vile, self-pitying, depressed assholes!
Worker
So, why do you think they called her that?
Michael
Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!
Worker
What is the difference?
Pete
Oh my God! They're totally different!
Worker
Okay, different how?
Pete
They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible! [flips hair] You're, you know... They're posers!
Firkle
Emos suck my Goth balls.
Michael
Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an emo thinks that deep down, they are totally fucked up.
Worker
That's not much of a difference.
Pete
That's a huge fucking difference!
Michael
Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide.
Pete
This fuckin' bitch, man.
Michael
But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people commit suicide
Pete
Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.
Michael
Wait, I thought we were cynical. ...What what whatever, it doesn't matter.
Pete
No, see, you're nihilistic.
Michael
Oh yeah, you're right.
Troubled Acres Rehab for at-risk teens (with emotional problems... who need structure), day. It's a secluded camp with a large greenhouse in the middle. In a white room is Henrietta, with only a bed and blankets to keep her company. There's an emergency light above the door and a security camera in one upper corner of the room. She kicks and bangs on the door
Henrietta
Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this! [notices the camera and looks at it.] This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! [the floor opens up behind her. She turns around to see what's going on, and a plant rises into the room. She looks at the plant, puzzled. It begins to shake like a rattle, then stops]
A South Park Transit bus stop, day. The three goths await Henrietta's return. Firkle holds a sign that reads "WELCOME BACK BITCH"
Pete
What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?
Michael
She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have? [the bus arrives and they all turn to look at it stop. The rear doors open and they look in. Henrietta appears and they gasp.]
Firkle
Oh. My. God. [Henrietta steps off, and boy has she changed!]
Henrietta
Hey guys. [she now wears a green headband, pink highlights in her hair, and additional pink makeup around her eyes. The left eye is made to look as though it's been crying. Her gloves are pink and black and instead of her cross necklace, she wears a necklace where the pendant is shaped like a bat]
Pete
What the hell have they done to you?
Henrietta
What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. [walks away. The other three move a bit to get a better look at her leaving]
Michael
Oh my God it's worse than we thought! They made her emo!
The school gym, day. The kids are tossing basketballs at each other. Kenny tries to climb a rope while a girl looks on. The coach blows his whistle and moves off screen. As he does so, the Goths are revealed on the bleachers
Michael
[concerned] Has she said one word to either one of you guys?
Pete
Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. [flip]
Michael
She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids. [the camera pans right, across the aisle, and shows Henrietta with her new friends, the Emos]
Emo Boy
God, PE class is for such wannabe posers.
Emo Girl
I'd rather kill myself than put on gym shorts.
Henrietta
I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die.
Pete
Uugh, how could she hang out with them??
Michael
There must something else going on here.
Henrietta's room. She's listening to music on her iPod dock while drawing a picture titled "I Am Alone." Someone knocks on her door.
Henrietta
Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!
Michael
[enters] It's not your mom, it's me.
Henrietta
Oh, hey. [lowers the volume.]
Michael
What did they do you you? At that camp?
Henrietta
What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.
Michael
Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that place turned you into an emo.
Henrietta
That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?
Michael
Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate? [she sits up and then turns off the iPod] I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they knew what they were doing.
Henrietta
[getting cross, then turns her chair around slowly] You should probably stop digging for answers.
Michael
What?!
Henrietta
There's no winning this for you. [gets off her chair and walks towards him] Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.
Michael
Nooo waaaaay.
Henrietta
Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
Michael
Omigodnowaaaaaaaaay.
Henrietta
Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth? [sataniccally] Join us!
Michael
[runs out of the house] No waaay! [runs out of the house and across the street and throws his cane away to the ground] No way no waaaaaay!
A tiny diner, night. Pete is reading a book titled "The Sinking Girl" on an armchair
A ring tone
Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and desp-
Pete
[answers it] Hello?
Michael
It's worse thann we thought.
Pete
What is? Everything? [flips hair]
Michael
No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like "I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world" and I was like "No waaay!" and she was like "Yeah, soon it will be too late." and I was all "No waaay!"
Pete
No way.
Michael
Yeah, so listen: call up Firkle and meet me at Village Inn. I gotta run home, but I'll be there in ten minutes. [rushes home and closes the front door, then runs up the stairs.]
Michael's house, night. He runs upstairs...
Mom
Michael! Michael! [Michael leans over the rail]
Michael
Can't now, Mom! I've got an emergency!
Dad
In the dining room Michael! Let's go! [Michael goes down reluctantly and enters the dining room] Have a seat, son. [Michael takes a seat opposite his dad.] Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while.
Michael
What??
Dad
[holds up the same brochure Mrs. Biggle held up two weeks earlier] We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and-
Michael
What the hell are you talking about?!
Mom
This place gonna fix you, make you normal child! [moments later his dad takes him outside and toward the truck]
Michael
No! You've gotta listen to me! You don't know what you're doing!! [Dad throws him into the car] You fucking conformists! [the truck starts up and backs out of the driveway. Michael looks across the street and sees Henrietta with her emo friends, two of whom are new. He gasps. As the truck pulls away he screams through the closed window] They're evillll!
The Village Inn, night. Pete and Firkle are in a booth drinking coffee and smoking.
Pete
I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
Firkle
Pete... if they get me... if I get sent to that camp... and I come back Emo... kill me. Promise that you'll kill me.
Pete
[flips hair] I promise.
Waitress
Hey, you kids need to order somethin' or you need to go! [pours some coffee into Firkle's mug.]
Pete
Not now, lady, we're really depressed.
Waitress
So what else is new?
Pete
This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos! [flips hair] There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.
Firkle
Are you crazy?
Pete
[leaves the booth] What choice do we have?!
Firkle
The Vampires are our sworn enemy. We beat up their leader, and burned down their lair. Don't you remember?
Pete
Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.
Conference room B, the noon hour. Vamp kids file in and take seats. The hour is set aside for Vamp kids and Twilight fans
Vampir
Okay, let's all be seated please? [the kids quiet down] This is thee noon meeting of the Vamp kids? I am Mike, your lord and dark master, per se.
Vamps
Hail Mike.
Mike
Okay uhhh, our main order of business is of course the Halloween social. We're still looking for volunteers to make the- [a round of snarls goes up as Pete and Firkle enter the meeting]
Mohawk Vamp
It's the Goth kids! [moves aside. The other Vamps turn to look at the Goths and take to hissing and snarling at them. A boy vamp steps forward and spits at Pete as Pete and Firkle head for the podium]
Pete
Ugh. You spit on me, Larry. [Mike steps down so Pete can address the Vamps] Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.
Firkle
Sorry.
Pete
But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.
Mike
You've got a lot of nerve coming here!
Pete
Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo. [the Vamps start talking amongst themselves] Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned.
Black Vamp
Okay hold up! Hold up! You mean that one of us might not really be a Vamp kid? [no one says a thing]
Pete
Uhhhhh, right.
Black Vamp
[steps into the aisle and moves forward] Well whoever you is, you better get yo' ass ready to run, muthafucka, 'cause you're a damn traitor! And I bet you it's this little nigga right here![stops by a Vamp in a skeleton sweater and purple highlights in his hair]
Henrietta's house, night. She's in her bedroom with a lot of new Emo friends.
Henrietta
Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?
Emo Girl
I can't. I'm too depressed. I keep cutting myself.
Henrietta
Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. [a knock is heard at her door]
Mrs. Biggle
[sing-song] Henrietta, I baked cookies for your new little Emo friends.
Henrietta
Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?! [gets sarcastic] I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! [her mom takes the cookies back and closes the door. She goes to the living room]
Mr. Biggle
Does she still seem better?
Mrs. Biggle
Oh, much better! She didn't call me a bitch, and she actually apologized to me.
Mr. Biggle
Well that's more like it.
Emo Boy 1
You know what we should do? After us Emos take over the Earth? We should um, paint the White House black. And we should have Fall Out Boy at the Super Bowl. [Mike rises up from under the window sill. The Emos don't notice]
Emo Boy 2
We're Emos. [the cowlick Vamp rises up next to Mike] When we rule the Earth we're not gonna have football.
Emo Boy 1
Oh yeah. [outside, three other Vamps hold up the two boys peering inside the window. Pete and Firkle sit on the roof nearby. The Vamps have seen enough and withdraw from the window]
Mike
And you say she just showed up like this?
Pete
You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
Cowlick Vamp
That blonde Emo is Sarah Collins. She was a Vamp kid two weeks ago.
Black Vamp
You want me to go in there and waste these mothafuckas?! I'll do it!
Pete
We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
Mike
Indeed. If there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters, then we will have to use our most powerful Vampiric abilities to stop it.
Cowlick Vamp
Do you mean?
Mike
Yes, my child of darkness. We must call upon the powers of the Vamp kids' most sacred entity, per se. Only he can help us in this darkest time. This calls... for a summoning.
The South Park Elementary Library, night. The Goths and Vamps are gathered at table there, complete with candles
Mike
We call upon the creator of all that is dark! The godfather of Death and Despair! Edgar Allan Poe, your followers in darkness beg for your help! [everyone looks around, but nothing happens] We summon to the world of the living the great Edgar Allan Poe! Knower of all that is misery! Your children need special guidance! Per se.
Pete
This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!
Mike
Edgar Allan Poe was the original Vamp kid.
Pete
No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!
Black Vamp
Ey, look man! All genres of Gothic subcultures are derivatives of Poe's work. Muthafucka!
Pete
Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! [a violent thunderclap and lightning immediately follow, and a vortex opens up on the ceiling]
Cowlick Vamp
Holy shit look! [Edgar Allan Poe appears and the vortex vanishes]
Poe
Where am I? What is this place?
Firkle
It's him! It's Edgar Allan Poe.
Poe
Why have the living summoned me from my rest? [Mike taps Pete to signal that it's his turn to speak]
Pete
Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.
Poe
Emos? ...Ew-oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists.
Mike
Yeah, oh yes!
Pete
Right!
Poe
Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs.
Pete
Thank you!
Mike
Hey!
Pete
I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
Poe
Agrees with who? Is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head, poser?
Black Vamp
Ah ah! He got you there, nigga!
Pete
Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.
Poe
Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!
Pete
Uh, yeah, it kind of does.
Poe
[floats away, mocking] Oh okay, Mom. Let's go fight the Emos, Mom.
Back at Troubled Acres, night. The greenhouse is lit. Inside, Michael is in a chair asleep, tied down to it by thick ropes.
Michael
What? Where are you tay- No! NO!! [jerks around and wakes up, assessing his situation] What the hell?? ...Oh my God. [he realizes where he is and tries to shake himself loose from the ropes] Get me out of here! Let me go!
Gardener
Shhhhh. [Michael sees him] It's best you don't upset them. [goes to water another plant]
Michael
What the hell are you doing to people?!
Gardener
Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat.
Michael
Wait a minute. Emos are plants? [the plants begin to rattle in their pots.]
Gardener
Shhh, shhh, it's okay. Not just any plants. They're very unique. Very special. Nobody understands them. Emoclarus americanus. Wonderful species.[] Except for their tendencies of self-mutilation and the need for other species to acknowledge their pain.
Michael
Oh, it all makes sense now! [A giant emoclarus rattles into view]
Gardener
Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry, Emo King. [holds a conversation with it] Oh no, I wasn't talking to him. I mean, I was, but- Y-yes! Yes, I understand. [walks back to a smaller plant] Right away.[takes the potted plant and walks over to Michael]
Michael
No. [the gardener sets the plant down next to him] What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo!
Gardener
[walks away, then turns around] You just don't understand. You'll understand them soon.
Michael
What the...? [the plant begins to rattle]
Gardener
It's quicker if you don't fight it.
Michael
No, NOOOOOOOOO! [begins to rattle with the plant]
The road, night. The Vamps and Goths are heading to Troubled Acres. Pete is driving
Pete
Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.
Firkle
[coughs] Dude, Edgar, can you not smoke in the car?
Poe
You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!
Pete
Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!
Poe
God, you guys are so lame! [tosses his cigarette out the window] And if you want my help, you'd better all stop calling me Edgar.
Black Vamp
Well that's your name, isn't it?
Poe
That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: NightPain
Black Vamp, Mike, and Pete
Oh God...
Poe
What? You guys are posers!
Black Vamp
Ey, just so you all know, if one of you ain't who you say they is, and we get inside that base and you reveal you're actually one of them Emo muthafuckas in disguise, I WILL go crazy on yo' ass!
Poe
If one of us is a traitor, it's probably your wannabe vampire leader.
Mike
Oh, fuck off, NightPain.
Poe
Make me, poser.
Troubled Acres, night, at the greenhouse. A security camera follows the car as it enters the rehab center. Everyone exits the car. Another camera shows Michael rattling with the emo plant. A third camera catches the group going down one hallway.
Pete
Michael?! You here?
Mike
I feel like we're being watched. [yes they are, by the Security Cam 3000. A fourth camera shows Henrietta's former room. Zoomiing out reveals an emoclarus looking over a desk with videocameras all around. The king emoclarus looks on. It leans over and seems to whipser to the security emoclarus. In the greenhouse, the group reaches Michael, who has become delirious and is now groaning]
Pete
Dude! Michael, are you okay?
Michael
Kick it over! Stop the plant! [Mike walks over and kicks the plant away, then gets into a karate stance. Firkle disappears] Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies.
Pete
Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. [a gun is cocked and everyone looks at the source]
Firkle
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's not the plan.
Gardener
[appears behind him and approaches the group] You did very good. The emo plants are very pleased with your dedication.
Michael
Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo? [Firkle takes off his jacket and ... wig.]
Firkle
Don't you see we can't stop them? We might as well join' em. [The Emo King shows up and starts rattling. The gardener turns around and walks toward it]
Gardener
Yes Emo King, right away. [turns around again] The Emo King wants us to proceed at once. [moments later the black Vamp, Mike, and Pete are tied to chairs and plants are placed in front of them]
Pete
Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!
Gardener
Don't fight it. It's quicker that way. [the plants begin to rattle]
Mike
Oh God! I'm starting to feel Emo.
Pete
Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?
Mike
He said he was over this, and was gonna hang out at the Village Inn.
Pete
What?!
The Village Inn, night. The Ghost of Goth Past sits in the same booth the Goth kids sit in, sipping coffee and smoking
Waitress
[approaches] Hey, are you gonna order any food, or are you just gonna sit there and drink coffee all day?
Poe
Leave me alone! I just want coffeh.
Waitress
[turns around and leaves] Little prick.
Poe
Bitch.
Pete
[voice only] Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you? [his face appears in Poe's coffee] What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!
Poe
I can't right now. I'm dealing with a lot and I just have a lot of anxiety.
Pete
Look, we [flips hair] summoned you to help us save the world!
Poe
What's the point? Save some people so some other people can be lame? And then those lame-os can be lamer to some other posers?
Pete
God, he is such a downer! [the plants rattle again]
Gardener
Just let the spores inside you. Stop fighting it.
Mike
Wait. Look!
Poe
[floating in] Okay, I'm here, posers.
Pete
NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! [Poe descends and lands next to the Emo King]
Poe
What do you want me to do?
Mike, Michael, and Pete
Shoot it!
Poe
Really? Shoot a plant?
Michael
Shoot it! [Poe obliges, but nothing happens to the plant. A piece of its pot might have come off. Poe just shrugs.]
Poe
Wait a minute. What is this? [walks over and pulls out the plant's tag] This says it was bought at Lowe's Home and Garden for $29.95. [it's a common ficus]
Gardener
Lowe's Home and Garden?
Pete
Hey, these are just plants.
Gardener
No they, they talk to me.
Poe
No, they're just, like, ficus plants and vibrating pots.
Gardener
But-
Voice
Looks like it's over, Harold Flannagan. So we have just one question for you: are you scared?!
Flannagan
[frozen in fear] What do you mean?
Voice
ARE YOU SCARED?!
Flannagan
YES!!! [Pete flips his hair]
Voice
That's good! 'Cause you're on... "Yes, I Was Scared!" [music plays and the lights come on]
Pete
What?? [the cast and crew of that show come out of the plant work.]
Host
Look! Look at the camera right there
Flannagan
Oh my God, are you serious? [grins.]
Host
Your wife Sarah put you up to this.
Sarah
[pops in next to Harold] Haha I got you! [giggles some more]
Firkle
This is a prank?
Black Vamp
Oh man that's good! They got us good!
Firkle
I turned traitor for no reason?
Pete
[to Michael] Did you know about this?
Michael
I have no idea what's going on.
Host
Howard, did you suspect at all that a gardener job at a camp for troubled teens was a setup?
Flannagan
No, they really had me convinced!
Host
And you didn't suspect anything when we had plants tell you to turn Goths and Vamp kids into Emos when really they're exactly the same thing?
Flannagan
I guess I should have figured it out. I'm an idiot. [laughs about it]
Host
Tune in again next week, when we make a woman from Milwaukee think she's working at a haunted abortion clinic.
Henrietta's room, night. Henrietta's working on a new picture, featuring a gallows noose. A knock is heard at her door, and Pete walks in with Michael
Henrietta
So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?
Pete
Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants. [she stops drawing] From Lowe's Home and Garden.
Michael
It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show.
Henrietta
Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.
Michael
No, you just kind of did it on your own.
Henrietta
Oh my Gawd. [closes her eyes, drops her pen on the table, and pinches her nose at the bridge] This is so... em-barrassing.
Pete
Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was [flips his hair] we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader.
Henrietta
Oh. [sudden relief] Oh! [she begiins convulsing, then turns around in her chair] Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again! [gets off her chair and walks to the boys] Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys.
Mrs. Biggle
[peeks into the room] Henrietta, I have dinner ready.
Henrietta
Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!
Mrs. Biggle
...Fatty. [closes the door.]
End of Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers

Taming Strange
South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's classroom. Mr. Mackey is present, showing the class a new computer system he's had installed at school
Mr. Mackey
Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future. [holds a laptop with an IntelliLink logo on it] M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink. [presses a key that brings up the splash screen] Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal. [presses the space bar] M'kay... [presses it again. Presses is twice more, and the main menu pops up] You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school. [one such panel is shown next to the window] Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on "school clinic"[presses a button, and the school clinic menu pops up.] Mkay, see nurse. [selects it and a box appears on the right side with fields for teachers, student, note, and some checkboxes.]M'kay. Respiration problems. [presses a button, and "All Night Long" plays] Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay. [presses a key, and the song is cut off] It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board. [press, and gets to the main menu] Mesage... board. [moves the cursor to the message board icon and loads the board] Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance, [sees the first thread title that loads] here we go. Here's a message from Kyle's little brother, Ike Broflovski. [loads the message] Okay, little Ike says "My brother is a homo"[Cartman cackles and Kyle is startled] Ike made a little drawing of his brother too. [loads the drawing] Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off Kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice. [Cartman cackles again, and Kyle looks annoyed] It's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off Kyle's head there.
Cartman
That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
Butters
Heheh, yeah. [chuckles to himself. Kyle is now annoyed and embarrassed]
The Broflovski house, day, kitchen. Sheila is washing dishes when Kyle appears and enters
Kyle
Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
Sheila
Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
Kyle
I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
Sheila
It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. [Kyle thinks it over and walks out]
Ike's room, moments later. Kyle opens the door and enters
Kyle
Hey Ike, how's it going?
Ike
[looks over his left shoulder] Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm on my computer! [turns back to his computer]
Kyle
I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
Ike
Do I look like I wanna do fuckin' fingerpaints?! [looks over his shoulder again] Look at the fuckin' zits on my face!
Kyle
Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
Ike
Then stop harassing me, bro! You don't know what it's like to be a baby goin' through puberty! I don't know whether to watch Yo Gabba Gabba or go out and tame some strange!
Kyle
Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
Living room, moments later. Kyle and Ike sit on the sofa watching Yo Gabba Gabba. The troupe performs "Come On And Dance." Toodee steps forward to dance a bit
Ike
Dancy Dance is my favorite.
Kyle
It always has been. See? This is nice. [Foofa steps forward]
Ike
Who would you rather fuck? [Kyle is stunned] Foofa or Toodee?
Kyle
What?
Ike
I wanna fuck Foofa. [a closeup of Foofa dancing] I wouldn't wanna fuck Toodee. She's a dike. You can tell. But Foofa, man. [whips out a can of chewing tobacco, opens it, and scoops some tobacco out] I bet she's got some sweet strange. [puts the tobacco in his mouth] I don't even know what the fuck Muno is.
Kyle
Ike, is that chewing tobacco?
Ike
What?! You gonna fuckin' narc and tell Mom?!
Kyle
No, I just don't think it's healthy.
Ike
That's 'cause you don't understand shit! [stands on the sofa] I knew this was a bad idea! [leaves the sofa and walks away] I'm gonna watch Yo Gabba Gabba in my roomsy!
Mr. Mackey's office, a few days later. Someone knocks on his door.
Mr. Mackey
Come in, m'kay.
Kyle
[opens the door and peeks in] Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
Mr. Mackey
Oh-kay, have you set up a counseling appointment on IntelliLink?
Kyle
[goes all the way in] No.
Mr. Mackey
Ookay, that's fine, that's fine. We can use IntelliLink to see what's available. Let's see, counseling request. Students. Make appointment. [presses a key and his window blind goes down, and Kyle notices] Okay, ah whoops. Okay, uh sume, uh students make appoint-alala here we go. Make, make appointment. [presses a key and the lights go out. He looks around] Uhkay, here we go. Uhkay, what do you need counseling with?
Kyle
It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
Mr. Mackey
Okay, I'll click on family issues. What time did you want counseling?
Kyle
Right now.
Mr. Mackey
Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?
Kyle
I don't know.
Mr. Mackey
Alright, I can do a lookup for the name. Uh go back. Main menu. ["The Heat Is On" begins to play, and Mr. Mackey has lost control] Oh... Damnit. Okay now, back. [mumbles to himself as he tries to set things right] Set- no, set appointment. Okay, speakers off. [his blind rises] Okay, uh... Okay, what is your smart name, Kyle?
Kyle
What?
Mr. Mackey
Sorry, Kyle, we're gonna need to maybe go somewhere else. Uh... find an IntelliLink panel somewhere.
The boys' restroom. Mr. Mackey is on the toilet with an IntelliLink panel to his left, on the wall
Mr. Mackey
Okay, let's see, lights. [presses the light icon and some other icons pop up] Mood. [presses the mood icon and a timer pops up] Start counseling timer. [sets it for 15 minutes and starts it] Okay there we go. Okay, we got it. [smiles] Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?
Kyle
[takes a moment to gather them] He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
Mr. Mackey
Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.
Kyle
Yeah, he just seems so young.
Mr. Mackey
Well, your brother is Canadian. Perhaps Canadian puberty is a little different. Why don't you educate yourself about Canadian puberty and it could be somethin' yeeyou and your brother can actually do together. M'kay? [plop] You know, this is the first time I've been able to do counseling aaand go to the bathroom at the same time. IntelliLink is amazing.
A live program. The Canadian Board of Health Presents, "What Are These Changes?" A Guide To Puberty In Canada
Minister
Hello young people, and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life. You have braved the trials of childhood, and now you are reaching Canadian puberty. By now, you've probably noticed some changes in your body. For instance, when you fart your dick gets hard. [a long pause] Other physical changes are happening to your body as well. If you're a boy you may notice that your testicles ache, or if you're a girl, you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange.
Ike
This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!
Kyle
Let's just give it a chance, Ike.
Minister
Going through Canadian puberty, you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well. You're saying things like "hey boddy" and "hey guy" because now that you're older you're discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy, and someone who you used to call "guy" is quickly becoming your friend. [A shot of Kyle and Ike looking at each other] But now let's discuss how a man and a woman make love. [an animated stick-figure cartoon follows] First, a man and a woman fall in love. Then the man farts on the woman's strange, [That is shown, with audio] filling the woman's strange with air so that the woman can queef on the man's face. [shown, with audio] And, a baby is born. [pop] The entire process can take up to six months a- [turns to his right to listen...] It's what? ... That's not how a baby is born? ... What's semen? ... Well then, why did my wife queef on my face? ... She said it was to- ... [gets mad] Well then why would sh-?! ... I'm gonna get to the bottom of this! [pounds on the desk and leaves]
The street, near his residence, day. The host marches home
Minister
Make me look like an idiot, will you?!
At home. The double doors open and the host comes in. His wife is sitting on the sofa sipping tea
Minister
Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that's how babies are born!
Wife
I was being sarcastic.
Minister
Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that's how it's done!
Wife
I was angry because you never listen to me. Because I wanted you to go with me to therapy and you never go.
Minister
Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine!
The host goes to a therapy session with his wife.
Minister
Totally embarrassing and degrading! She queefed right in my face!
Therapist
Well, maybe you should spend less time at work making public health films and more time at home.
Kyle
What the fuck is going on?!
Ike
[hops off the sofa...] You're fucking stupid, Kyle! [...and walks away]
South Park Elementary, day, Room 7. The class is in the dark listening to "All Night Long" again. Mr. Garrison his his fingers in his ears to block out the song
Kyle
I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
Stan
He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
Kyle
He doesn't even let me near him!
Cartman
That sucks, dude.
Kyle
What??
Cartman
I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
Kyle
Oh, thanks! [Mr. Mackey is at the IntelliLink panel trying to set things right. The music stops and he stands up]
Mr. Mackey
Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?
Kyle
I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Mackey, can he just go talk to the principal?
Mr. Mackey
No, this is gonna work! I called IntelliLink and they said they were sending over an engineer. [someone knocks on the door.]
Cody
[looks in] Is this Classroom 7?
Mr. Mackey
Yes!
Cody
My name's Cody. I'm your smartnician. You're havin' some intelliproblems with your astutelinks?
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal. M'kay?
Cody
[taps the screen a few times] Uh huh, well here's the problem: your amsrtnames aren't intelligrated. [shows him the error screen]
Mr. Mackey
Oh I see.
Cody
If you wanna have those intelligrated with EasyLink, you might wanna upgrade your system to the silver package.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?
Cody
Let my call my supervisor on the intelliphone. [calls in]
Ike's room, day. He's playing with his toy trucks - a fire engine and a dump truck. He crashes them into each other. Kyle knocks on the door and then enters
Kyle
Hey Ike.
Ike
Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm playing trucks!
Kyle
Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
Ike
You promised!
Kyle
I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
Ike
Well what am I supposed to do?! See it myself?! I'm a little baby! Who's gonna hold my fuckin' hand?! You don't give a shit about how I feel!
Kyle
Ike, I do! I just-
Ike
You just love pushing me around! Is that what you wanna do, Kyle?! Kick the baby?! Well alrighty bro! Come on, Kyle! Kick the baby! [Kyle just looks at him, Ike takes off his shirt] Come on bro! Kick the fuckin' baby! Let's see you try it, wuss!
The Pepsi Center in Denver, day. Yo Gabba Gabba Live is starting. Next, a live performance of "Don't Bite People"
Plex
Hey Muno, what should we do now?
Muno
Let's play Cool Cool Trick.
Plex
Aaaall right! Who out in the audience has a cool cool trick to show us? [a line of kids is already in place. A boy steps forward] What's your name, little boy?
Ryan
My name is Ryan!
Plex
And what is your cool cool trick, Ryan?
Ryan
My cool cool trick is that I can jump in the air. [the kids in the audience cheer. Kyle notices that Ike has left his seat] Let's see you... jump in the air! [Ryan jumps, and the troupe cheers him on. Ike cuts in line and steps forward]
Plex
And what's your name, little boy?
Ike
Ike Broflovski.
Plex
Do you have a cool trick?
Ike
Yeah, for my cool cool trick I'm gonna tame Foofa's strange.
Plex
Tame mo what?
Ike
I can tame Foofa's strange, bro.
Plex
Uhhh, alright. Let's see our friend Ike tame Foofa's strange! [Ike walks up to Foofa]
Kyle
[running towards the stage] Ike no! Stop!
Plex
Oh, I see. You're actually- [shakes his head] Wait! Oh my God, what are you doing?! No no no! [parents in the audience quickly cover their kids' eyes] What are you doing to Foofa?! No!
The green room, after the show. Kyle and Ike sit on a sofa flanked by two officers
Plex
Now you listen here, little boy! It is never okay to take off your clothes and grind on another person!
Toodee
No, that's wrong!
Plex
Don't do it.
Brobee
Uh uh.
Kyle
We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
Muno
A little young for that, isn't he?
Kyle
That's what I thought.
Ike
This is stupid, bro. [takes out some chewing tobacco] Foofa shouldn't be limiting herself to little kids. She's fuckin' fine, dude. [puts it in his mouth]
Plex
What you did was very traumatic for Foofa. Isn't that right, Foofa? [Foofa is frowning, but stays silent] Foofa?
Foofa
He's right, Plex. We're getting older. I don't wanna do the little kid thing the rest of my life.
Brobee
Foofa, what are you talking about?
Foofa
It's time for us to start playing to older people. Maybe we need to be edgier. Have a little sex appeal.
Toodee
Foofa, no!
Foofa
I'm an artist. And if all I ever do is play to kids, then I'll be a joke. [turns around and walks towards the door] I have to move on. [walks out of the room]
Plex
Oh God. What has this little boy done??
A Canadian pub. The minister of health is sitting with an older man at table
Minister
I try not to think about it, Rick. I try to just forget aboot it and then move on, but I can't. I mean... she queefed right in my face!
Rick
Have you and your wife seen a therapist together?
Minister
Yes, we went but... I just can't erase the memory of my helpless face being queefed on like that. Who's to say she won't do it again?
Rick
Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?
Minister
What do you mean?
Rick
There's more to this, Terry. A lady never queefs in her lord's face without some major cause. You started as the Canadian Minister of Health and three months later your wife queefed in your face. There's a connection.
Terry
I took the job to try and make Canada's health care system better. What could that have to do with my wife?
Rick
Terry, I'm your friend. And I'm not just your friend, I'm also your boddy
Terry
Thanks, guy.
Rick
[points a finger at him] And I'm telling you there's more to this than you think! [crosses his arms] And if you want to save your marriage, and your face, you need to figure it out quick.
South Park Elementary Faculty Lounge, day. Principal Victoria has called a staff meeting, with Mr. Mackey as the man in the hot seat
Principal Victoria
Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent [reads the bill] $22,000 on the IntelliLink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.
Mr. Mackey
Well yeah, but see, the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet.
Mr. Adler
They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!
Mr. Mackey
I know that IntelliLink has had some... hiccups... uhkay. But I've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the IntelliLink system and make sure it runs smoothly. I want you all to meet Pat Conners. [she enters and takes a seat next to Mr. Mackey]
Pat
Hello everyone.
Mr. Mackey
[immediately points a finger at her] Don't "Hello" us, Pat! This system that you're responsible for now isn't working out! So [pounds his fist on the table] what the hell are you gonna do about it?!
Pat
Oh. Well, I'm just sort of getting acclimated to the situation and I-
Mr. Mackey
Getting acclimated?! [stands up in anger] Do you know how much money we wated on that thing?! How about you take some damned responsibility! Get the hell out of here, Pat! You're fired! Get out! [Pat takes her briefcase and walks out] Well. How the hell are we gonna clean up Pat's mess? I guess, I dunno, I guess we got no choice, m'kay. We're just gonna need to the upgrade to the IntelliLink Gold Package. [opens his laptop to show the splash screen]
Principal Victoria
Oh noo!
Mr. Mackey
No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes.
Coach
Mr. Mackey, let's be clear. IntelliLink was your idea. You should admit it was a bad one and stop being so defensive.
Mr. Mackey
Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an "accident" while you were "drinking" on a "hike," "N'kay!"
Miles
Hey now listen here-!
Mr. Mackey
No! Now you listen to me! [pounds his fist on the table] IntelliLink is a great idea, and we just need the Goddamned Gold Package! We are doublin' down!
E! News segment
Anchor
[voice only] You're watching E! Entertainment News. God knows why. [video added] She's all grown up and she wants you to know it. From kids show star to sex symbol, Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa is ready to rock! [a montage of Foofa magazine covers and poses] She's been seen out partying, photographed smoking pot, and now, Foofa has announced a raunchy performance on the MTV Video Music Awards. Foofa's new manager claims the MTV performance will be one for the record books.
Ike
[At a bar via satellite, drinking, smoking AND chewing tobacco.] Foofa's got that nice shaved strange that you just wanna get in and tame the second you see it.
Anchor
The video awards are at 8 pm tomorrow.
The Broflovski living room, evening. Ike and Foofa are watching E! from the sofa.
Foofa
Oh this is so exciting!
Ike
Told you it'd go over well.
Kyle
[walks in from the kitchen and stares at both of them, then firmly says] Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
Ike
Shut up, Kyle! Just ignore my little brother.
Kyle
I'm your big brother, Ike! [the doorbell rings]
Ike
Answer the door, twerp! [Kyle is angry, but there's not much he can do, so he answers the door. He sees Plex]
Plex
Can I talk to you?
Kyle
I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-
Plex
Foofa! [runs in, followed by the other Gabbers]
Brobee
Thank you, dude.
Muno
Oh thank God.
Toodee
Heey.
Kyle
Hey!
Plex
Foofa, what is this about you going on the MTV Video Awards?
Foofa
I'm done being a kiddie star!
Plex
Foofa, you don't have to show your strange to get attention.
Ike
You just don't get it 'cause you're a robot, Plex.
Plex
Alright, you won't listen to us, but maybe you'll listen to our special guest, Sinéad O'Connor! [the rest of thte troupe welcome her as she walks up to them]
Sinéad
Don't do it, Foofa, Don't sell out your strange to those corporate bastards.
Ike
Awww, screw off, Sinéad O'Connor. No one gives a crap about you.
Plex
Don't show your strange on TV.
Troupe
Don't show your strange.
Plex
Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see.
Troupe
Don't show your strange on TV
Sinéad
I'm looking for a boyfriend. Looking for a boyfriend.
Kyle
Will you get out of my living room, please?! [the phone rings and he answers it] Hello?!
Terry
[calling in from Canada] ...Have you ever had someone you love queef in your face? [serves himself some Canadian port]
Kyle
What?
Terry
I'm sorry, I'm calling everyone in the Canadian health care system to find out if they're pleased with their health care. Is this [checks his monitor] Ike Broflovski?
Kyle
No, this is his brother.
Terry
Your brother receives his medication from us, so we just wanna be sure he's satisfied with the service.
Kyle
Satisfied with- [thinks a bit] Wait a minute. What medication?!
Canadian Health Department, day.
Terry
Before this meeting continues, I should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores.
Kyle
[confused] Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
Terry
People all over the world get their medication from Canada.
Kyle
Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
Terry
That's impossible! The Canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with IntelliLink. [this alarms Kyle]
Kyle
You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
Terry
Sure, no problem. [gets to work] Now, what is your brother's Canadian Medicare's smartname?
Kyle
I dunno! [thinks a bit] Try "strangetamer."
Terry
"strangetamer" [the lights go out, a window shade comes down] Uh, yeP, there it is. [presses a key and the lights come on] Ahh yes, here we go. I see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last May. [check again] Ah, yes, I'm afraid IntelliLink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast.
Kyle
Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
Terry
Yes, that's right.
Kyle
That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
Terry
It's fine! [pounds the table with his fists] It works fine! Just give it some time! [stands up] God, you sound like my wife! [turns left and walks away from the chair.] My... my wife.
Rick
[sitting in an armchair nearby] That must be it. Don't you see, Terry? That health care integration system has made you defensive and hostile, and your wife's been puttin' up with it.
Terry
[thinking out loud, in a stammer] And... that's why she queefed in my face.
Kyle
Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
A Patriots vs. Broncos game, day
Announcer
Tom Brady looking sluggish again today. Not sure what his problem has been lately.
Tom Brady
Blue 28! ... Blue 28!
Commentator
Yeah, definitely not looking as strong and virile as he has in the past, Tom.
Tom Brady
[his pants begin filling with poop] Huthuuuut [more poop comes out. The more he says it, the more his pants fill with poop] Hike!
Announcer
Brady steps back to pass. [Brady makes sure not to trip over his poop] He's got an open man at the 40 yard line! [Tom throws the ball, but it goes straight to the ground]
Commentator
And whatever is wrong with Tom Brady just seems to be getting worse. [Exhausted, Brady just sits on top of his poop and then sinks into it] Go Broncos.
South Park Elementary cafeteria, day. The sprinklers haved turned on and drenched everything. "The Heat Is On" plays on the PA system. Mr. Mackey sits on the floor in the same position Brady was in. The emergency lights flash on and off, and the kids are still eating lunch, despite being drenched. Suddenly, the music, lights, and sprinklers stop
Cody
Okay, there we go. [Mr. Mackey lifts his head up, disgusted] Your students can buy school lunches now, but they won't be able to get grades.
Mr. Mackey
No, they have to be able to get grades!
Cody
Well, what you prbably wanna do is upgrade to IntelliLink Platinum.
Mr. Mackey
No! There's no more upgrades, m;kay?! I just want this [points to a panel] to work!
Cody
...What exactly do you mean by "work"?
Mr. Mackey
I just want students to be able to make appointments to see the counselor, be able to see the school norse in the easiest, most streamlined fashion!
Cody
Oh, you want the Centurion package. That's where we take all the IntelliLink panels and we rip them off the walls and we burn them. Then we wipe all the computers of IntelliLink software and you never deal with us again.
Mr. Mackey
[walks away and thinks it over] Alright, upgrade me to the Centurion package.
Cody
Right away. [goes to Room 7 to rip off the panel from the wall as Mr. Garrison watches from his desk, goes to the bathroom and rips the panels off the walls, goes to the various school offices and tears the panels off there, makes a bonfire in a steel drum out on the playground, and dumps all the IntelliLink hardware into it. He returns to the cafeteria and joins Mr. Mackey again, offering him a clipboard] Well alright sir, here's a clipboard you can use for students to sign up for counseling, [Mr. Garrison takes the clipboard] and I wanna thank you for choosing IntelliLink. [reaches into his back pocket, takes out a gun, and blows his brains out. He falls down, dead. All the students as well as Mackey are stunned]
The MTV VMAs, night
Announcer
The MTV Video Music Awards will be back with a performance from Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa singing, "Pound My Sweet Strange."
backstage, Foofa and Ike wait for her cue
Stage hand
Two minutes, Foofa.
Foofa
Thanks. Oh my, here we go! [Kyle appears at the far end of the room]
Kyle
Ike! [runs up to him] Wait! [the rest of Yo Gabba Gabba show up]
Ike
Get out of here, dude!
Kyle
Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
Ike
No, you don't understand, wuss! Why can't you just let me grow up?! Why do you keep harassing me?!
Kyle
Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit! [Ike is awed at this] And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
Host
All right, y'all, here comes our next big act!
Kyle
Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
Host
Give it up for the sexiest bitch on earth, it's Foofa!
Foofa
Come on, Ike. Ike?
Ike
He's right, Foofa. Part of growing up is rebelling, but I'm gonna get older whether I like it or not. So why push it? I think I'm just gonna let it happen naturally. [walks to Kyle and the troupe]
Yo Gabba Gabba
Yaaaaay.
Brobee
Foofa? [Foofa looks at the curtains, then at the group, then takes off her towel to reveal her domiatrix outfit, with two arrows pointing towards her strange, and walks out onto the stage]
Foofa
Come on, come on, and pound my strange. Pound it like this, [Yo Gabba Gabba reacts. Brobee covers his eyes] pound it like that.
Terry's mansion, day. He comes home, enters, and walks up to his wife
Terry
It was a mistake.
Wife
What?
Terry
Trying to reform Canada's health care system and being too stubborn to admit that it wasn't working. And even when my wife said the system was too complicated, I wouldn't listen.
Wife
Oh Terry, I was just trying to get your attention. I'm sorry I queefed in your face.
Terry
I deserved it. Anyone who thinks streamlining health care into an integreated health care system would go smoothly deserves a giant queef in their face. Thank you, my lady.
Wife
So IntelliLink is gone, my lord?
Terry
Yes, I've upgraded to the Gold package. Within no time, Canadians everywhere will be getting their correct medications, and going back to normal.
The Broflovski house, just before dawn. Kyle is asleep, but is awakened by chortles of laughter from downstairs. He gets up and goes to see what's happening
Kyle
Ike?
Ike
[back to his normal voice] Kyle! It's Dora the Explorer!
Dora
Come on, let's climb the mountain.
Kyle
It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
Ike
Yaaay! [Kyle is pretty happy too, and joins him on the sofa]
Dora
We made it all the way to the top.
Ike
Oh man, I wouldn't mind hittin' that. I bet she's got that hot Puerto Rican strange. [Kyle's smile vanishes]
Kyle
Yeah, I bet she does.
Ike
Yaaaay!
End of Taming Strange

Ginger Cow
Lunchtime at the South Park Elementary Cafeteria.
Cartman
[walks in] Hey, everyone? Excuse me! [the other kids start to turn towards him] Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up. [finally has everyone's attention] Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
Kyle
About what?!
Cartman
I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller? [a ginger boy with dark red hair leans to his left for a better view] Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
Craig
Where did you find a red-haired cow?
Cartman
[crosses his right arm over his chest and points to the doors behind his left shoulder] Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
a pasture, nearby. The class walks towards a pasture near the school. Cartman climbs to the top of the fence. Stan and Clyde pop their heads into the pasture for a better look. Kevin, and Kenny join Cartman on the second rung. The other kids stand behind the first rung.
Cartman
There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. [The camera turns right and stops at a cow with a Jewfro, glasses, a freckled face, and huge red polka dots on her body. Cartman laughs at his cleverness]
Butters
Whoa, look at it!
Cartman
[giggling to himself] You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
Craig
[takes out his phone and starts taking pictures] Wow, that's pretty trippy.
Cartman
Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it! [Butters and Kevin take their phones out...] I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! [Jimmy takes out his phone...]
Kyle
Alright, Cartman, joke's over. [Kenny takes out his phone]
Cartman
What? What joke? This is real!
Kyle
Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
Cartman
No, [drops down to the ground] no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
Butters
Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
Cartman
Thank you, Butters! [laughs to himself]
Craig
I gotta show this to my mom! [leaves, and the other kids disperse]
Butters
Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! [leaves. Only Kyle remains with Cartman]
Cartman
Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
Kyle
Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
Cartman
Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. [walks away]
A montage of three news reports. The first one is from Al Aziz Network, where one of the news team members browses the Web for news. He's reading reports in various languages - Korean, then French. The French report gets his attention, "اه! این چیه؟" (Eh! What is this?) he calls some colleagues over and says ".اینجا رو نگاه کن! اوه، اینجا رو نگاه کن! می‌گه یه گاو ماده‌ی قرمز دیده شده" (Take a look! Hey, take a look! Says a red heifer was found.)
His colleague asks him "کجا این گاو قرمز ماده دیده شده؟" (Where was this red heifer found?) He replies with "این یعنی چی؟" (What does this mean?) when his colleague says "!زود باش! زود باش! ما اینو باید همین الان خبر بدیم" (Quick, quick! We gotta go public with this right away.) The scene changes to a broadcast with a voice-over ".هم‌اکنون اخبار را برای گزارش مخصوصی موقتا قطع می‌کنیم" (We interrupt this broadcast for a special report.) with a text on the screen which reads "اخبار دنیای ایرانی" meaning Persian World News with an Iranian news anchor reporting an irrelevant story ".مجلس مالزی منحل شد. مجلس این کشور را منحل اعلام کرد تا زمینه را برای انتخابات آماده سازد" (Malaysian parliament dissolved. The Parliament announced the dissolution of the country to set the stage for early elections.) He then reaches for a pistol under his desk and blows his brains out. Next are two Swahili reports covering the same report. The female reporter uses a pistol blows her brains out first, then the male reporter. The last scene has a Japanese reporter covering the report, but he has a dagger ready for seppuku. As he reports, he performs the seppuku, dying just as he ends the report. A colleague comes up and chops his head off with a katana, then uses a pistol to blow his own brains out.

South Park Elementary, Room 7. The kids are in their seats, and the PA system comes on.
Mr. Mackey
Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?
Kyle
Huh?
Mr. Mackey
Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
Butters
Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
Kyle
Nothing. [hops off his chair to leave the classroom]
Butters
Busted!
Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Kyle enters and closes the door, but notices three rabbis to his left.
Mr. Mackey
Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle.
Kyle
Wuwhat's going on?
Principal Victoria
Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.
Kyle
[glances at the rabbis again] I don't speak Hebrew.
Mr. Mackey
Kyle, please try your best. It seems pretty important. [to the rabbis, in bad English] This.. boy... uhkay... is Jew. Uhkay? Jew... like you. Uhkay? Please... uh, please try... speak... to Jew.[Kyle looks at the rabbis]
Rabbi 1
[sighs] We're just trying to tell them that we come on very urgent business. [Kyle looks back at Mr. Mackey]
Mr. Mackey
Anything?
Kyle
He said they come on urgent business.
Principal Victoria
Ohh, what does he need?
Rabbi 2
Look, we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people! We wish to see the red cow!
Kyle
The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
Principal Victoria
For what? What did he say, Kyle?
Rabbi 1
Please, you must understand! The fate of the world is at stake! [walks to his right and walks over to the window] The coming of a red heifer is the nost holy sign in all of Judaism. It signals the beginning of the End. It is not just our religion, but Islam and Christianity as well. They all agree on one thing. [turns around] That the red heifer means the End of Times.
Mr. Mackey
You catch any of that, Kyle? [Kyle looks at Mr. Mackey in disbelief]
The pasture, moments later. Kyle leads the rabbis, Principal Victoria, and Mr. Mackey to the cow.
Kyle
It's right over here by uh-
Rabbi 2
Oh my holy shmear! [a group of Muslims is already bowing down to the cow. One of them notices him and tells him to get out. (!برو بیرون)]
Rabbi 2
The Muslims! They beat us here! [hops the fence and charges at them. The other two follow suit.]
Mr. Mackey
[frantic] What's goin' on, Kyle??
Kyle
He said the Muslims beat them here- [to himself] God damn it!
Rabbi 2
[arrives next to the cow] Step away! You all know what this means!
Cleric 1
Yes! And you know you are about to die!
Kyle
Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
Rabbi 1
Don't touch it! [they all surround the cow, keeping Kyle and each other away from it]
Some hours later, the police have arrived and cordoned off the cow, and put up barriers further out to keep everyone away from it. The growing crowd begins to clamor
Cartman
[to a reporter] Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, "Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it."
Kyle
[trying to reach Cartman, but trapped by the crowd] Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
Cartman
I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. [chuckles loudly]
Kyle
NOOOO!
Rabbi 4
[arrives with a sheet of paper, and Rabbi 2 looks at it] The Muslims and the Christians are calling for a meeting to discuss the terms of war.
Rabbi 2
Very well, let us meet to discuss how the world as we know it ends.
The Airport Hilton, day.
Rabbi 1
Alright, so far we agree there'll be no automatic rifles, no shanks, and no chemical weapons.
Cleric 2
If there can be no chemical weapons, then the Christians can use no nuclear weapons. [clamoring follows]
Bishop
Come on, without nuclear weapons, what kind of final Armageddon is this gonna be?! [clamoring follows]
Rabbi 3
But couldn't we agree on non-ballistic nuclear weapons only?
Bishop
Yeah, I suppose that's fine.
Cleric 2
That makes sense.
Rabbi 1
Non-ballistic nuclear only. Alright. Now on to prisoners. Are we all agreeing to decapitations?
Israeli
Of course we are! What do you think this is?!
Others
Yeah, come on! Just get to it!
Cleric 3
Wait a minute, wait a minute! Has anyone noticed something? We are all in a room together. Talking. [walks to the front of the crowd] Has it occurred to anyone else that this prophecy, which amazingly is in all three religions, could actually be meant to bring us together?
Bishop
[walks up to him] The prophecy says the red heifer signals the End. [joins him] Could it mean the end of... war?
Rabbi 1
If the cow is sacrificed in Israel according to the prophecy, then perhaps it could bring about peace.
Jerusalem, day. a wonderful view of the city. A helicopter comes into view with the ginger cow dangling from it. It arrives at the Temple and hovers over it. A few second later, the sling holding the cow is released and the cow falls onto the roof of the temple, dying on impact. The crows looks at the helicopter leave and then cheers
Anderson Cooper 360 news segment
Anderson Cooper
After all the years of holy wars and hatred, a possibility for peace... in the Middle East. In the past 48 hours, Jews, Muslims, and Christians have met in Israel to sort out their differences. It may be a rocky road, but many say the chance for peace is real. And all because of a red cow, discovered by a young boy here in the U.S. [the doorbell rings and Kyle goes to answer it]We'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this. [Kyle opens the door and sees that it's Cartman]
Cartman
Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
Kyle
Yeah. [Cartman enters and Kyle closes the door]
Cartman
I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
Kyle
No shit!
Cartman
I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said "No." I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
Kyle
Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
Cartman
[shakes his head] No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
Kyle
Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don't you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
Cartman
But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank? [no reply] Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
Kyle
Dude, go to Hell!
Cartman
You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! [picks up the house phone and starts punching]
Kyle
Wwwait. [Cartman stops]
The kitchen, moments later. Sheila is washing dishes when Kyle and Cartman enter
Kyle
Mom?
Sheila
Hi bubbe.
Kyle
Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
Sheila
What is it, Kyle?
Kyle
[looks down and to his right] You're a fat skank, Mom. [shuts his eyes. Sheila is shocked]
Cartman
[gasps loudly] Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
Kyle
You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. [turns and walks out. Cartman's jaw drops.]
Cartman
Ohh my God! [whips out his camera phone and feigns concern] Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
South Park Elementary, next day. Cartman walks down the hallway, with Kyle trailing him, carrying his backpack and books
Cartman
[reaching his locker] Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. [opens his locker and puts a book on top of the stack. Stan, at his neighboring locker, notices]
Stan
How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
Kyle
I just... thought it'd be nice.
Cartman
[puts another book on the stack] Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework, [puts a third book on the stack] gave me the soda from his lunch. [removes the second and third books he just placed on the stack] I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East. [places the third book back on the stack] Right, Kyle? [puts the second book back in the locker]
Kyle
Yes sir.
Cartman
Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
Kyle
Yes. [sets Cartman's books and backpack on the floor, then walks to the middle of the hallway] I love Cartman's farts.
Cartman
You what??
Kyle
Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
Craig
Dude, what the hell are you talking about?
Kyle
Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
Cartman
[walks up to him] Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle. [Kyle does so, and Cartman backs up onto Kyle's face] Let's see what I can muster up here.
Kyle
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
Cartman
Let's see. Oh! Oh! [farts, then gets off Kyle]
Kyle
[stands up] Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. [turns around and walks away. Cartman smiles. Stan and Kenny can't believe it]
Stan
[enunciating] What the fuck?
Mr. Mackey's office. Someone knocks on his door
Mr. Mackey
Come on in.
Kyle
[opens the door and walks in] Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
Mr. Mackey
Wuh sure, Kyle. What's the matter?
Kyle
If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
Mr. Mackey
Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?
Kyle
[rubs his tears away] Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it. [Cartman sneaks a peek around the open door] I love it sooo sooo much.
Mr. Mackey
Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
Kyle
Because they taste so yummy. [his voice quivers, Cartman giggles from behind the door]
Mr. Mackey
Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that.
Cartman
[enters and clears his throat] Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
Kyle
Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
Cartman
[small gasp] Kyle, are you sure?
Kyle
Please...
Cartman
Well alright. [farts into his left hand and cups it over Kyle's mouth, making sure the fart goes all the way in.]
Kyle
Yummy yummy.
Mr. Mackey
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
Jerusalem, evening. a huge crowd of people from all three Faiths of the Book cheers as a cleric, a rabbi, and a bishop sit at table onstage. Each has a symbol of his faith with him - the cleric has a cow bell, the rabbi has a candle, and the bishop has a chalice
Bishop
Today... begins the new Israel. [the cleric lifts up a cow bell and rings it, then sets it down] Today, we are all united as one. [the rabbi lights the candle] Chakam balada.
Crowd
Chakam balada! Chakam balada! [followed by lots of cheering]
Rabbi 3
Now, let us celebrate under one symbol! [the clergy go their separate ways and the table sinks into the stage. After several peals of the bell, the floot the table was on returns to the stage as the three religious symbols combine to form... the Van Halen logo. Van Halen's music comes on and the stage lights go on. Eddie Van Halen takes the stage, followed by the rest of Van Halen, with David Lee Roth on mic]
Rabbi
No way no waaay!
Muslim
Epiiic!
David Lee Roth
Hello Israel! [launches into "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love"]
CNN Reporter
The party is officially underway. Jews, Christians and Muslims have united, ushering ten years of Van Halen. [archived live footage follows] Out in the crowd, people are celebrating like never before. [nineteen seconds of footage and song follow] No doubt Israel is the happiest, rockingest place to be.
Kyle's room, day. He's sitting on his bed, tortured. His eyes are closed
Stan
Hey Kyle.
Kyle
Hey
Stan
Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
Kyle
I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.
Stan
...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
Kyle
[gets emotional] I just do, Stan.
Stan
You like... how they smell? How they taste?
Kyle
Yes.
Stan
They're really that good?
Kyle
Yes.
Stan
Should I try them?
Kyle
NO.
Ringtone
Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy.
Kyle
This is Cartman. I have to take it. [answers his phone] Hello?
Cartman
Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
Kyle
[keeping quite calm] I don't care.
Cartman
I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
Kyle
That's fine. [hangs up]
Stan
...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.
Kyle
Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
The landing outside. Kenny waits for Stan to come out. Stan does this and closes the door
Stan
I don't get it, Kenny.
Kenny
(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)
Stan
Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
That night, Kyle is tossing and turning in his bed
Kyle
No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. [begins to reject Cartman's farts in his dreams. A bright light appears and Kyle wakes up, then looks at the foot of his bed]
Spirit
Kyle Broflovski.
Kyle
Huh? Who...? Who is that?
Spirit
Why do you endure all the farts, Kyle?
Kyle
I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
Spirit
What you are doing... is the most awesome thing ever.
Kyle
I... I know.
Spirit
Who else would take such torment?
Kyle
That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
Spirit
You should like, shave your head and get all peaceful about it. Your sacrifice saves the world.
Kyle
Yes.
Bathroom, next day. Kyle shaves all his hair off
Kyle
I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
Jerusalem, evening. During vespers, "Hot For Teacher" begins to play
CNN Reporter
[now in party mode - shirtless and with face paint on] What can this reporter say except that Israel freaking rocks! Things just keep getting better here, Tom. And in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow, here on stage, and things are gonna go off!
South Park Elementary, day. In the hallway, Kyle, now bald, is laying on the floor as Cartman sits on him again, trying to fart
Cartman
You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? [three quick farts]
Kyle
Yes! Yes I will!
Cartman
Huh? You comin'? [three more quick ones]
Kyle
Yes, whatever you want. [a longer fart]
Cartman
Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. [leaves, screen right. Kyle stands up]
Stan
Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
Butters
Just stop, please.
Kyle
[dressed in gray pants and white tunic, no footwear] It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. [walks away, screen left]
Craig
Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
Kyle's room, day. He's sitting on his bed, meditating. His eyes are open
Stan
Hey Kyle.
Kyle
Hello, Stan.
Stan
Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
Kyle
There are greater things at work than what you understand.
Stan
If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
Kyle
I'm actually the complete opposite.
Stan
All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
Kyle
I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
Stan
See? You sound like a dick.
Kyle
[thinks a bit] I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
Stan
Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
Kyle
All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
The landing outside. Kenny waits for Stan to come out. Stan does this and closes the door
Stan
I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
Kenny
(Huh? Like what?)
Stan
This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
Jerusalem, eve, two days later. Van Halen finishes a song, and Rabbi 1 is at the podium
Rabbi 1
And now, let us honor the little boy who helped make all this happen, Eric Cartman, and his best friend, Fartboy. [Cartman and Kyle come out onstage to great applause. The rabbi gives Cartman the mic]
Cartman
Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
Kyle
Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
Cartman
Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
Kyle
Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
Rabbi 1
Uh excuse me, I'm sorry everyone, but apparently there's some breaking news in the United States.
A satellite feed appears, with a reporter, Stan, and Kenny.
Reporter
We are in Colorado where the red cow was discovered, and apparently, two boys have shocking news that might change everything.
Stan
Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been [Stan's phone rings] So- sorry, hang on. [pulls the phone out of his jacket pocket and answers it.] Hello?
Kyle
Dude! Do not do this!
Stan
No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
Kyle
Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
Stan
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Muslim 2
"Oh" what? [an Israeli throws up his hands in a shrug]
Kyle
I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
Stan
Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
Kyle
I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!
Stan
You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all "Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!"
Kyle
Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
Stan
You should apologize to Kenny too.
Kyle
I'm sorry, Kenny!
Kenny
(That's okay, Kyle.)
Rabbi 1
No, what is the new information?!
Stan
The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
Kyle
Hurray!
Rabbi 1
Oh no, it was a miracle?
Israeli 2
Then, it's not true. The prophecy is not true! [rounds of disappointment as everyone starts leaving]
David Lee Roth
Wait, I thought we were all here because of the prophecy of a miraculous red cow!
Rabbi 5
No, the prophecy is that one day, a fat child with a small penis would decorate a cow to look ginger, not that one would miraculously just fall from the sky. [Kyle is stunned that Cartman fulfilled that prophecy]
Muslim 2
I knew this was all too good to be true!
Bishop
We are associating with these heathens for no reason!
Cartman
Small penis?!
News break
Anchor
The party's over. Muslims, Jews, and Christians are back at each other's throats, and Israel is once again a place of conflict, and turmoil
A synagogue, day. Kyle is pleading his case with the rabbis
Kyle
Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
Rabbi 3
No it di'n't.
Kyle
Yes! It did!
Rabbi 1
The prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger. We should have known a prophecy like this... was too impossible to ever come to be.
Kyle
But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
Cartman
No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
Kyle
But it's the truth!
Cartman
No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
Rabbi 1
Sorry boys, but we've gotta get to our fight. There's a rumble at the Wailing Wall. [brings out a switchblade. Rabbi 2 has a shot gun, while rabbi 3 carries a bat]. They leave, and Kyle turns around
Kyle
Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
Cartman
Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? [puts his hand on his ass and farts on it, then puts whipped cream on it, with a cherry on top, and smothers it on Kyle's face. He then walks away. A few seconds later, the cherry falls off]
End of Ginger Cow

Black Friday
South Park Mall, day. It's looking mighty impressive now. A large banner for Black Friday, November 29, hangs high above the main entrance. Winter is coming. A senior security guard paces back and forth while briefing the other guards about Black Friday madness.
Guard 1
The holiday season... is here, and Black Friday... is upon us. As you know, black Friday is the day shoppers go berserk for holiday deals. Last year, 26 people died, and 461 were seriously injured. [stops by a guard who lost his right arm, puts his right arm on the guard's left shoulder and closes his eyes for a moment, then moves on] This winter the mall is offering 80% off to the first thirty people in the store. [The guards shout out various responses] For you new recruits, perhaps you took this job to see just what the violence was like. [a closeup of a guard without a chin] Or perhaps you thought workin' Black Friday wouldn't be a big deal. [looks at Randy, who just smiles innocently]
Randy
I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
Guard 1
[ominously] Or maybe you're just too stupid to realize what you've gotten yourselves into.
Chief of Security
That's enough! [the other guards turn to see him, an old guard with a scar over his left eye, and his back to them] Our only chance of surviving this year's sale is by sticking together! Those of you who signed up are to be... commended. [turns around] But I warn you: do not underestimate the battle that's about to take place outside those doors! [the other guards stay silent, and he turns towards the front entrance.] Winter is coming.
Neighborhood, day. Cartman the Wizard walks down the sidewalk and on to Kenny's house. He knocks three times with his walking stick, and Kenny opens the door.
Cartman
Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
Kenny
[looks around the living room] (She's not here right now.)
Cartman
Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
The Great Hall, day. A bunch of boys in costumes are downstairs in Cartman's basement. As the boys talk amongst themselves, Cartman calls the meeting to order with three taps from his walking stick.
Cartman
Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig and mumbles coyly]. Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.
Clyde
Which nobody can afford.
Cartman
What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
Token
If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.
Cartman
I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
Butters
Woo, spooky.
Craig
Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.
Cartman
It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
Stan
[stands on his chair] It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
Cartman
On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together! [pounds the table with his left fist] ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
A news show, with a female anchor and a male anchor.
Male Anchor
Well it's almost Thanksgiving, and we all know what that means.
Female Anchor
That's right. Black Friday is right around the corner.
Male Anchor
Ouch.
Female Anchor
And people are already gearing up. [cut to shoppers]
Shopper 1
[obese man with only one tooth] We usually start linin' up around 3 am. We uh douse ourselves in pig blood, because it does help us slip through the crowd when the doors open.
Shopper 2
[with his family] We do it every year, part of the family tradition. Last year we lost our youngest daughter. Her head was stepped on and crushed, but, in her memory, we're going to find a young girl and step on her head this year.
Shopper 3
[an angry obese woman with two fat kids behind her] If anyone thinks they're gonna beat me inside that mall, and keep me from gettin' [points to her younger kid] my kids Christmas presents, they can kiss my fat vagina, 'cause I'm bringin' the motherfuckin' pain! [bares her teeth]
Reporter
Tom, the South Park Mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year. One thing's for sure, people take Black Friday very seriously.
Cartman's house, night. The segment begins with a grinder honing a wooden sword. Panning out, Scott Malkinson is shown operating the grinder for Jimmy, who's waiting on his sword. Scott finishes and hands the sword to Jimmy, who begins to wield it. Other boys, including Stan and Kyle, are paired off and shown sparring with their swords. Tweek and Token try their hands at archery, trying to strike dummies with arrows.
Cartman
[walking around, surveying his knights] Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
Butters
[runs up with a sheet of paper and hands it to Cartman] Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! [salutes with his left hand]
Cartman
[flatly, but sternly] They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
Butters
[lowers his hand] Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.
Cartman
Okay, we need to start immediately, please. [clears his throat and reads] Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
Stan
The House of Greyhawk?
Kyle
Larry and Brad Stoltsky
Cartman
But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
Clyde
[raises his left hand] Hey yeah, I know. [lowers it] How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?
Cartman
Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
South Park Mall, day. Under cloudy skies, a lone guard sits near the entrance, drinking from a metal flask.
Randy
[walks up] Hey, [notices the flask] that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that? [the guard shares his flask] Oh, thanks! [sits down near the guard] Gets a little boring around here, you know? [takes a swig from the flask]
Guard 2
Enjoy the boredom while you can.
Randy
So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? [hands the flask back to the guard]
Guard 2
I did.
Randy
Is it really as bad as they say it is?
Guard 2
The shoppers... Hm... They started showing up at midnight on Thursday... They... didn't line up, they just crammed themselves near the main entrance... I can see their faces smooshed up against the glass, licking their lips, waiting to get in... God, the sounds that they made... It was 5 am when they opened the doors... There was screaming... blood... people... tearing each other's faces off while holiday music played in the background... I saw a woman... pick up her daughter by the ankle and swing her into some old guy's head... Before I knew it they were all around me... fighting, clawing. Then a hand reached in and pulled me out. Old Cap. He saved us all that day. [A shot of the chief of security] When it was over... the front of the mall was... covered in red. Bodies... shopping bags... [a shot of the banner again] And now winter comes again. [after a few seconds of reflection, he quickly drinks the rest of the flask]
Downtown South Park, day. Cartman and Butters are walking
Butters
Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
Cartman
Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
Butters
Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
Cartman
What do you mean?
Butters
Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
Cartman
Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
Butters
Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
Cartman's backyard, evening. The boys are back practicing their swordplay. Cartman and Butters step through the sliding door onto the yard
Cartman
We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! [the boys cheer this good news]
Kyle
Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
Boys
Yeah!
Craig
Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? [everyone's smiles vanish]
Cartman
That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
Craig
I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.
Cartman
[chortles] What?
Jimmy
M ma um m-me too.
Cartman
...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
Kyle
Yeah.
Jimmy
Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox.
Kyle
Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
Cartman
That's right.
Kyle
If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
Craig
Right. Let's all get PS4s.
Kyle
[taken aback] No, the XBox's are gonna be better.
Tweek
They're not better, they're just more expensive.
Cartman
We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
Craig
That's exactly how XBox people are!
Jimmy
Yeah!
Cartman
Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
Craig
We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!
Cartman
[thinks for a moment] Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
Craig
Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! [Fosse joins Craig and Tweek, followed soon after by Jimmy and two other boys. Bill and Jason join them as well, while Scott joins the XBox group]
Kyle
No! We can't divide like this! [Stan leaves the XBox group] Stan? [Stan turns around] You're on our side, right?
Stan
I like the PS4's controller better.
Kyle
[stunned, then] Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
Stan
[tears welling up] The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because... [gets mad] because that's how XBox people are.
Kyle
[determined] Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
Stan
[determined] If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
Kyle
I know.
Cartman
[walks up to Kyle] Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. [turns around and walks away with the XBox group, with Kyle joining him. A shot of the mall as day turns to night]
The Marsh house, night. Randy comes home from work as a mall security guard
Randy
[singing to himself] Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat. [opens the front door and enters, closes the door and sets the keys on a small table] Please to put a penny in the old man's-
Sharon
[waiting for him by the sofa, with her arms crossed] What the hell are you doing?
Randy
[stops] Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.
Sharon
Bullshit.
Randy
I did, Sharon. [begins walking past her] I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.
Sharon
[stands up and follows Randy for a few steps] You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?
Randy
[goes onto the first stair step and thinks of his reply, then turns around] Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!
Sharon
Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
Randy
Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee. [flaps his right hand like a wing] Bzzz bzzz. [goes on up the stairs]
A Trekker's room. The room is furnished to resemble the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. A Vulcan sits in the captain's chair. Star Trek: TOS music plays
Ensign
Thrusters are at 20%, captain.
Kevin
Engage, ensign. Warp factor 1.
Dougie
Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman.
Kevin
On screen. [the monitor on the floor lights up and Cartman is seen.]
Cartman
Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
Kevin
Nothin' much. We're just about to check out a Class M planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.
Cartman
[to Clyde] God these guys are such dorks!
Clyde
Just find out who they're loyal to.
Cartman
[performs the Vulcan sign for goodbye] Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
Kevin
Given the XBox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for Starfleet.
Cartman
[to Clyde] Oh my god they're so gaaay! [to the Trekkers] Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
Dougie
Cheap XBox Ones? For real?
Cartman's backyard, moments later. Cartman comes out of his house with Clyde in tow.
Cartman
The Federation has agreed to fight with us! [the group gathers at a round table] With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size! [Kyle sadly nods in acknowledgement] You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
Kyle
I don't know.
Cartman
You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
Butters
Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. [closes his case by crossing his arms]
Cartman
[with his right hand over his nose] Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
Butters
I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
Kyle
This isn't helping us, Butters!
Clyde
The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
Kenny
(What do you mean?)
Clyde
Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
Cartman
What new Elmo doll?
The Elmo Doll commercial. What's the GIFT children as asking for this HOLIDAY season?
Elmo
[pops into view] Heheh, who, me?
Announcer
[a blonde girl unwraps her gift] Just in time for the holidays, it's Stop Touching Me Elmo. [the girl shows him to the camera] When you press his back, Elmo puts his hand on your knee and says fun things. [a boy demonstrates this]
Elmo
Have you ever been tickled on the inside? [next, the blonde girl is asleep with it] I'm lonely. Are you lonely? [she wakes up. Next is a boy in his own bedroom room] Can I watch you go potty? [the boy looks at the doll. Next is a brunet girl with curly hair] You wanna kiss the guy who does Elmo's voice? [the doll puts his hand on the girl's knee. This alarms her]
Girl
Stop touching me, Elmo! [swats his arm away. He tries again and she stops him sooner. He tries again...]
Announcer
Elmo also helps kids brush their teeth with his toothpaste dispenser. [a shot of a boy putting toothpaste onto his toothbrush from Elmo's groin]
Elmo
More! More! More! Aaaghghgh.
Announcer
Don't miss out on this holiday season's biggest gift! Stop touching me, Elmo!
Announcer 2
Available at South Park Mall staring Black Friday.
South Park Mall, day. Randy arrives with some coffee and sees some other guards
Randy
Morning, Joe, Marcus.
Guard 3
Morning, Randy.
Old Cap
What madness is this?? [Randy and the other two guards walk over.]
Randy
What is it?
Old Cap
[reads from an announcement] A new Elmo doll. They're releasing a new Emo doll [rolls up the announcement] just in time for Black Friday.
Guard 3
Oh Christ, no!
Old Cap
You've murdered us! [looks up at some business people in front of a Toy Safari store] You soulless monsters, you've killed us all! [some knocking is heard from the main entrance. The guards look to their right and see the crowd beginning to form outside]
Guard 4
Oh, God, they're already lining up.
Shopper 1
Eelllmoooo
Guard 3
No! They can't line up this soon! This is crazy!
Old Cap
I'll deal with these demons! [walks towards the entrance, opens the doors, and walks out. The doors close and he addresses the crowd] If you are here for Black Friday, the line starts on that side of the rope. [shows them the rope. which has a small sign saying "BLACK FRIDAY LINE" on one of the poles]
Shopper 4
Oh. This rope right here? [walks over to the rope. The rest of the crowd follows him and stand behind the rope]
Old Cap
That's the line for Black Friday, so other people can do normal shopping today.
Shopper 4
Oh. Okay. Thanks. [Old Cap goes inside and the shoppers resume knocking on the glass walls.]
Shopper 4
Elmooo.
Shopper 5
Give me Elmo.
South Park Elementary, day. Stan leads Jimmy and Craig to the Goths' hangout at the side of the school
Stan
We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
Michael
Are you for real?
Jimmy
You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on.
Michael
Of course we're going to go with the PS4. They're blacker!
Stan
Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
Pete
Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available.
Stan
No, you can't do that!
Jimmy
Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.
Stan
Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
Henrietta
What's Betamax?
Stan
Exactly!
Pete
What's VHS?
Stan
...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
Michael
Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.
Jimmy
Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us. [turns right and walks away. Craig follows, and Stan looks at the floor, saddened]
A lush garden, night. Cartman and Kenny walk through it. Kenny is caressing a mouse
Cartman
Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
Kenny
(Yes. What's up, my lord?)
Cartman
I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever... [picks out a yellow rose and gives it to Kenny] switch sides, [Kenny sniffs it] it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
Kenny
(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)
Cartman
True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours. [stops and faces Kenny] Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
Kenny
[strokes his mouse] (Yes. That's right.) [they resume the walk]
Cartman
You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
Kenny
(Yes, I believe we do.)
Man
Hey, you damned kids! [Cartman and Kenny turn to face the voice, which turns out to be a man looking out his bedroom window on the second floor of his house] Get the hell out of my yard!
Cartman
Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
Man
No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it!
The mall, night. The mall is closed, and Randy makes the rounds, buzzing to himself. He stops by RadioHut to check out the specials
Randy
Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
Voice
Doin' alright there, Rookie? [A hand falls on Randy's left shoulder, startling him]
Randy
Whoa! Haha. [recognizing Old Cap] Yes sir!
Old Cap
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Randy
No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
Old Cap
Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job.
Randy
You-d, you do?
Old Cap
I see it in you. You care about people. [smiles] Same reason I do it every year. [takes Randy for a walk] You remind me of my son. He died on Black Friday in '89. Guess I'm still trying to save him. [stops] Look, I just want to say I... I really appreciate what you're doing. I promised my wife this would be my last Black Friday I worked. When I see folks like you, it... makes me hopeful that people will still be okay.
Randy
[going with it] Yeah... awesome...
Old Cap
No, damn it! [noticing something outside] No lining up behind the velvet rope! [goes towards the entrance] God they just don't listen! [Randy sighs and buzzes to himself more soberly]
The PS4 army's tent, night. A soldier is keeping watch next to the tent
Jimmy
C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.
Craig
Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.
Stan
And who do we have on our side?
Jimmy
Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.
Stan
Did you ask the Vamp kids?
Craig
They're still undecided.
Stan
[walks towards the tent's entrance] There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. [looks at the campfire outside, around which sit Tweek and two other boys]
Boy
Playstation...
Jimmy
Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.
Craig
We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.
Stan
So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
Sony Corporation, Japan, night. The head of the corporation is humping a woman from behind on his desk, in his office. Two board members arrive and one of them clears his throat.
Corporate Head
Huh? Isogashii yo! [I'm busy!"]
Member 1
Sorry to disturb you sir, but we thought you should see this. [pulls out a flier]
Corporate Head
[gets down from his desk and puts on his robe] Omae-ya kikei ["You freak"]. [the woman gets off the table and skulks away while the corporate head walks to the board members] Jishu, taihen ne. ["Geez, how dreadful"]'[takes the flier and looks at it. It's a flier Cartman had made up and distributed everywhere, even Japan] Winter is comingu. Choose side-o. Nani kore? ["What is this?"]
Member 1
Just a small down in Middle America, but apparently, a war is escalating.
Member 2
Sir, if this were to become a news story, and if the first people inside their mall all got XBoxes... well it clearly looks bad for our image.
Corporate Head
[looks more closely at the flier] So desu ne... ["I see..."]
South Park Mall, day. A Channel 9 News reporter is on camera
Reporter 2
What's going to be the big item everyone goes for this Black Friday? It just might be the PlayStation 4. Sony has just announced they offering a special Black Friday bundle, called the "Brack Friday Bunduru," which will include four controllers, a map of Japan, a hundred dollar rebate, and, allow you to automatically pre-order for Metal Gear Solid V. No doubt Sony has just raised the stakes.
Cartman's backyard, day. There are more kids in the yard now, all honing their skills for the coming battle. Cartman walks among them
Cartman
Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners! [walks further along to Kyle, who's sitting on a tree stump.] Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
Kyle
Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
Cartman
Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
South Park Mall, day. The crowd at the Black Friday line has gotten bigger and the clamoring has gotten louder. Randy is keeping the peace.
Randy
Alright, listen up. [the crowd quiets down] The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night. [the clamoring resumes] It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands. [the crowd knocks down the rope and overwhelms him] Augh! Hold on! Oh God!
Shopper 6
Wristbands!
Old Cap
[sees the commotion and arrives to restore order] Back! Back, all of you! [the other guards come to help out] If that's how you are, there'll be no wristbands! No go! [delivers a left jab to a woman in front of him]
Shopper 7
Oh!
Old Cap
Back away! [Shopper 1 comes up behind him and stabs him]
Shopper 4
I'm getting my son that Elmo doll, you fuck! [pulls the knife out and rushes away. Old Cap collapses]
Randy
No! [runs to Old Cap's side as more guards exit the mall. Randy reaches him first, and the other guards gather around them]
Old Cap
You did good. The watch is yours now.
Randy
No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
Old Cap
This is what we signed up for. Right, my friend?
Randy
No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
Old Cap
Heh. Now you know how serious this is. Whatever your intentions before, protect this town. You are in charge now. Take this. [puts his hand over his left eye and... pulls off what turns out to be an adhesive eye patch and places it on Randy's left eye] Don't let... Black Friday... be the end. [dies. The other guards stay around, not knowing what to do]
Randy
[rises] Get back inside. We have work to do. [the guards file back into the mall]
A backyard, night. Its surroundings are a bit shabby - an overflowing trash can, an old lounge chair... Stan is facing Craig and Jimmy, and a few seconds later, turns around
Stan
When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own! [the army is shown, and it includes the Goths, the Vamps, the handicapped kids, and some first graders. The house behind them only has one story, and it looks run down. A security grill is falling off one of the windows and the fence is in tatters. The army cheers for itself] I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided. [more cheering. A familiar figure sits on a throne...] Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! [he turns around and unsheathes his sword, raising it to honor the new leader]All hail the Princess! [points the sword at her, and more cheering follows. Princess Kenny, Lady McCormick, has arrived]
PS4 Army
The Princess! Yeah! [a mouse crawls into view, on the Princess's left shoulder, and roars]
End of Black Friday

A Song of Ass and Fire
Kenny provides a recap of what happened last week on the show, with clips from that episode.
Kenny
Previously, on South Park.
The intro follows with the boys dresses as fantasy figures, and dramatic music matches them. Next, a white screen appears, with a silhouette of a black wall and a crow on it. The crow calls out
Narrator
Now let me tell you, child, of a war that is about to come. [turns out the wall is the two consoles over which the war will be fought - the PS4 and the XBox - and the crow is on the display for the XBox One.] Since time unremembered there have been two. [the crow hops from the XBox One display to the PS4 display] One dark and unforgiving, the other pure and filled with light. [next is a silhouette of a woman looking at South Park Mall from a pile of rocks] At the dawn of war, I stand alone, looking out at would be the last battlefield, for winter is coming, and I... am a princess. [the woman is Princess Kenny] Once a common lady of the dark army, but, denied my right to be called princess by birth, [Kenny hops off the rocks and walks] I've betrayed my kind, [Kenny enters EVGames] and now I have chosen my side: that which I believe is best for all, [Kenny flips through the games and chooses Vomit Cops, then plays it] for it has the dual-shock controller with a speakers and a touchpad interface. [Kenny walks home] Our land is split in two, brother against brother, friend versus friend. [enters his house and walks past his parents] My parents will fight on Black Friday as well. For what? I do not know.
Stuart
What the hell is he wearin' now?
Narrator
[walks out to the back yard and sits on her throne] My followers, though few in number, shall help see me through until I am finally accepted as a princess by all. I cannot rest, for I know that even now, the enemy is training for battle, also preparing for winter.
XBox One army base, day. As the rest of the army watches, Butters and Scott do some swordplay. Scott's tongue is hanging out of his mouth
Scott
En garde! [Butters takes up his sword and swordplay resumes. While the crowd cheers the swords-boys on, Cartman is not impressed, and he buries his nose in his hand while squeezing his eyes shut]
Cartman
Alright, stop, stop, stop! [leaves his chair and walks up to Scott and Butters] This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! [swings his staff at Scott's mouth and lands it, making Scott's tongue go back in his mouth]
Scott
Aaah God ow sorry...
Cartman
There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! [leaves]
Butters
[not sure what to do next, then swats Scott on his back] Yeah!
Scott
[falls onto his knees] Ah!
Kyle
[catches up to Cartman] Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
Cartman
The men are just inexperienced, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
Kyle
It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
Cartman
That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him! [they go through the sliding door] I said, "You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!" [reaches his refrigerator and opens it, looking for something to consume]
Kyle
Sony released the PS4s, Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
Cartman
[turns around, holding a glass of milk] I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru! [takes a swig of it] Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. [leaves, forgetting to close the refrigerator door]
Cartman's room, moments later. Cartman is at his desk placing a call, still grousing about Kenny
Cartman
Stupid asshole! [looks at a picture of himself and Kenny at Casa Bonita putting their arms around each other, with dreamy expressions, as they used to be best buds. He folds it up and lays it on his desk, face down] Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard. [lost his patience] Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!
Microsoft headquarters, night. The CEO's office. Steve Ballmer is at his desk
Secretary
Mr. Ballmer, John and Dave from Marketing are here to see you. [the men come on in]
Ballmer
Yes, hello. How are things going out there?
John
Sir, the tides of war are changing.
Dave
There's a king in Colorado, a young wizard who believes that Sony will have the upper hand if we do not come to his aid.
John
He claims that with our help, his followers are prepared to fight to the death over which system is better.
Ballmer
Uhh, what are you guys talking about? You sound ridiculous.
Dave
[looks at John, then] There's... going to be a war in this small town on Black Friday, and it's all over the news!
Ballmer
Guys, these are console wars, not some epic battle for a kingdom. I mean, come on.
Dave
...but, this one kid said that he's a wizard, and that Sony is helping-
Ballmer
Guys, guys guys! It's just a video game machine, alright? Microsoft's a company that... tries to be above all the petty commercialism, okay?
Dave
Ok-Okay.
John
Okay. [they turn and leave]
The Channel 9 newsroom. The anchors are reporting
Tammy
Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality.
Tom
Niles Lawson is on the scene, and Niles, what are you hearing?
Niles
[holding in his left arm a giant candy cane, with blood stains along the hooked end] Tom, tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer Miles "Happy" Davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldn't line up for Black Friday until Thursday night. In honor of the slain mall security officer, the mall has officially decided to drop another 10% off Black Friday deals!
The Wall of Honor, established in 1974. A framed picture of the slain officer is placed on a shelf on the wall, and a small bouquet of flowers placed in front of that
Randy
Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
Guard 3
[runs up to Randy] Captain! Captain! The mall is dropping the Black Friday sale another 10%.
Guard 4
What?
Guard 5
Oh my God.
Guard 6
They can't do that!
Guard 7
What? That's 90% off!
Guard 8
Oh God! They're back! The shoppers are back! [the camera pulls back to reveal a large crowd of shoppers slowly moving towards the mall. One of them holds a flyer for the new Black Friday deal. The fog is so low it looks soupy]
Randy
Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. [exits the mall]
Outside the mall, night. The crowd continues its somewhat slow march towards the mall, but a main road and parking lot stand between them and the mall
Randy
[through a bullhorn] If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.
Shopper 6
We're not on mall property.
Randy
Well, you're about to be.
Shopper 6
Well, what if we just walk really, really slow? [the crowd slows it's walk further, growls spread among them, as they start to resemble a White Walker's] Black Friday!
Randy
You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
Shopper 7
We can walk really slow. Look. [the shoppers start to shamble and quietly moan in a full parody of a White Walker army]
Randy
Smartasses. [turns around and goes inside the mall]
The Garden of Andros, day. Cartman and Butters walk along the familiar path
Cartman
Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick.
Butters
You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
Cartman
Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him. [picks a rose out for Butters, just as he did for Kenny before.] How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
Butters
They don't!
Cartman
Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
Butters
Yeah, I finished it!
Cartman
So what happens when the dragons show up?
Butters
Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
Cartman
Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
Butters
Wha-what do you want me to do?
Cartman
Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
Butters
Who's George R. R. Martin?
Cartman
He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
Homeowner
Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damn yard!
Cartman
[shoots back] Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
Homeowner
Yeah?! Well how come every time you talk to somebody, it's about betraying somebody else?!
Cartman
Why don't you mind your own business?!
Microsoft headquarters, night. Steve Ballmer is on the phone.
Ballmer
No. Listen, for the last time, we don't have any dragons to send them. If some people wanna choose PlayStations, it's their choice. [a knock is heard]
Secretary
Sir, Mr. Gates is here.
Ballmer
Bill Gates? [to the caller] Uh, I gotta go. [hangs up, rises from his seat, goes around the desk, and greets Bill Gates] Hey heeey! Bill Gates actually showing up at Corporate.
Gates
[shaking hands] Hey Steve, how're you doin'?
Ballmer
Not bad, you know? Just tryin' to get this next gen press stuff handled.
Gates
I heard there's a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere?
Ballmer
Oh it's- no, it turns out it was nothing, just some kids tryin' to turn the console wars into somethin' bigger.
Gates
Oh my gosh. You know, when I uh... stepped down and left you in charge of the company, Steve uh, I knew there might be some challenges for you.
Ballmer
Yeah, well, nothin' I can't handle. [a man dressed in black appears behind him] There might be some changes we need to make to our marketing, but I'm optimistic. [the man approaches Steve.]
Gates
Uh huh.
Ballmer
You know, I think we'll ultimately sell the number of units we want to. [the man takes out a dagger and gets closer]
Gates
You're right, Steve. Some changes do need to be made. [the hitman reaches around and stabs Ballmer through the chest and drags the dagger to the right, cutting open Ballmer's chest even more. Ballmer cries out, but is choking in his blood. Ballmer steps backwards and falls on his back gasping for air. Gates takes a glass of wine to a sofa and sits down to look at Ballmer] Do you know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time's done. It's all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There's only going to be one winner. I can't have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve. [Ballmer takes his last gasps as Gates walks out of the CEO's office. Gates addresses Ballmer's men] Clean that shit up.
New Mexico, evening. Butters and Scott are walking down a street. Butters checks a map for George R. R. Martin's address
Butters
Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.
Scott
I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
Butters
Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. [Butters and Scott stand in front of a mansion gate somewhere in the Southwest. Cacti abound on either side of the high fence. Butters reaches up and presses a buzzer]
Butler
[through the intercom] Can I help you?
Butters
Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
Butler
Who is this, please?
Butters
Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up? [two seconds of silence] Hello?
Butler
I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans.
Butters
We're not fans!
Scott
Yeah, we don't like it!
Butters
We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
Butler
About what?
Butters
Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! [the buzzer sounds again and the gates open. Butters and Scott go inside and towards the front door. George R. R. Martin steps outside to greet them]
GRRM
It's the Red Wedding, isn't it? You hate how I killed everyone off?
Butters
Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
GRRM
Oh they're coming. The dragons are on their way.
Butters
When?
GRRM
You really wanna know?
Butters
[sternly] Please. It's urgent.
GRRM
Alright, King Joffrey is still at King's Landing, but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan. And His wiener gently hangs down between his legs. Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight.
Butters
No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
Scott
Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.
Butters
Uh what's the matter, Scott?
Scott
I told you I have to eat every two hours.
Butters
He's diabetic.
GRRM
Oh Jeez, uh, why don't you kids come out from the cold? I'll order some pizzas.
Butters
Oh. Okay, thanks.
GRRM
Come on in! I'll tell you everything that's gonna happen in Game of Thrones. [leads the boys inside]
The Garden of Andros, day. Cartman and Kyle walk along the familiar path
Cartman
Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
Kyle
If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
Cartman
It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army [picks a rose out for Kyle], but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation. [Kyle sniffs the rose] It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be... [stops] grounded?
Kyle
Grounded? For what?
Cartman
That could be up to you.
Kyle
No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
Cartman
Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right. [begins walking] Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Seems a little convenient, doesn't it? [stops and faces Kyle] Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
Homeowner
Don't believe it! [Cartman and Kyle look at the homeowner] He said that to a bunch of people!
Cartman
Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
Homeowner
You're callin' the cops?!
Cartman
Yeah!
Homeowner
You're on my property! I'm callin' the cops!
Cartman
Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
A bedroom, night. A couple is having sex in it. As the camera pans right, it reveals whom the couple is - the Channel 9 news team. Niles appears at the door with a microphone in hand. He clears his throat
Tom
[startled] Oh oh! [calms down] Oh, it's you.
Niles
Tom, I'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report.
Tammy
We don't go to work for another hour.
Niles
[walks to the foot of the bed] We just got a call from Bill Gates. [sits down] He says he can promise us a bigger war on Black Friday if we play along.
Tammy
He wants us to side with him?
Niles
That's right, Tammy. Let's not forget that having a bloodbath on Black Friday is good for the news. It's good for us. The bigger, the better.
Tom
Our job is to report the news, not make it more violent!
Niles
Right, Tom. Because you're sooo about integrity. Let's go. [stands up and walks to the doorway, then turns around] Or maybe I should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to! Back to you!
Channel 9 Morning News, with Tom and Tammy Thompson
Announcer
It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson. Colorado's top-rated brother-sister news team.
Tom
Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there.
Tammy
That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise.
Niles
Tammy, the excitement over Black Friday is peaking, and none other than Bill Gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger. [Bill Gates appears]
Gates
That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers.
Niles
We understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well.
Gates
Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety.
The neighborhood. The XBox army marches down the street, with Cartman being borne on a litter by several boys. Some of the bearers are Clyde and Kevin. One of the Federation members, dressed as Geordi La Forge, is indeed carrying a gun. The army approaches Kenny's house, and Token knocks on the door
Mrs. McCormick
[answers the door] Yes?
Cartman
Hi, is Kenny home?
Mrs. McCormick
Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.
Cartman
Forward, men! [the bearers try to fit Cartman through the door, but they can't fir through. First they run into the door frame on the left side] That, no- [then on the right] No, you- You've gotta turn me. [the bearers tilt the litter some seventy degrees without Cartman falling off and finally fit through the door.]
Kenny's backyard. The PS4 army is there, practicing
Jimmy
It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions! [other soldiers rally]
Other kids
Protect the Princess! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Get out!
Cartman
I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
Stan
Let them pass! [the PS4 army makes way for the XBox army. Cartman is carried over to Kenny's throne]
Kenny
(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Please, state your purpose.)
Stan
[translating] The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose. [Kenny plays with the hair on his wig]
Cartman
You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
Kenny
(You can change your mind instead of fighting us on Friday.)
Stan
The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
Cartman
Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
Kenny
(What?!) [fans himself] (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)
Stan
The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
Cartman
That doesn't even make sense.
Kyle
[steps forward] Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
Stan
What I started? How dare you!
Kyle
All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
Stan
I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
Cartman
You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! [Stan and Kenny look at each other, then Stan thinks a minute]
Stan
The gods will find us a way!
George R. R. Martin's living room, later. He's expounding on the Game of Thrones...
GRRM
So then Samwell Tarly sees the army approaching, and his wiener is about this big. [about 18 inches, by his estimate. Butters is losing patience as Scott fades] He knows that Stannis Baratheon's wiener is probably shriveled from the cold. Samwell has to rally his men, so what does he do? He takes out his wiener [unzips his pants and demonstrates his story] and he dangles it around for all his men to see. [shakes his hips and pretends his wiener is a bell]
Scott
AAAH! [turns away for a moment]
Butters
OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
GRRM
Yeah yeah, they're on their way. They're still coming. So Samwell's wiener goes [shakes his hips around as if his wiener were a bell and makes sounds for it]
Butters
But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! [Scott had said he needs to eat every two hours]
Scott
If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out.
GRRM
[zips up] Don't worry. They're coming. Pizzas are on their way. They're gonna be amazing. [picks up where he was interrupted] Now, John Snow finally faces Jaime Lannister, and this guy's wiener is, you know, huge, right? So it's not goin' to be easy.
Scott
Ehhh...
The Garden of Andros, day. Cartman is back with another partner in crime
Cartman
Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
Gates
Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?
Cartman
Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help. [picks another yellow rose for Gates] But I hope that we're clear that this is my army. [hands the rose to him. Gates sniffs it] There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
Gates
Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want.
Cartman
Your CEOs?
Gates
Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
Cartman
Uhhh, hmmm. What?
Homeowner
[from his bedroom window] Hahaa! How's it feel?! Now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?!
Cartman
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
Homeowner
Why don't you stay the fuck out of my yard?! [slams his window shut]
Sony Headquarters, Japan, night. The President of Sony is on top of someone, giving it to them, but that person is silent.
President
Ish, ish, ish, o-ish, haishooo! [quickly sits up to deliver the final thrust, then collapses onto his bed. He then rolls over on his back, revealing whom he was having sex with]
Niles
[with mic in hand] That was amazing sex. I enjoyed it immensely. How about you?
President
[gets a cigarette and lights it.] Tanoshikatta ne. (Yeah, it was fun.)
Niles
You know, Microsoft has given kids who want XBoxes on Black Friday a lot of support. Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided.
President
Eh? Nani kore, tsukareta yo. (What? I'm tired!)
Niles
Black Friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight. That's bad for both of us. There must be something you can give to kids who want Sonys to make the fight more even.
President
Hai. ["Yes." He reaches over to his left and grabs a box] Kore ga arimasu. ["Here it is" He opens the box and something begins to glow inside]
Niles
[leans in to see what it is] Yes, I think that will do nicely.
GRRM's Santa Fe mansion. He's now poised to be conductor. He taps his music stand with the conductor's stick. The scene changes to show a chorus of 10 white, middle-aged men in red-sashed, black, concert tuxedos holding musical scores and standing on double row of concert risers facing GRRM. They begin singing
Chorus
[Classical men's ensemble singing in musical round style, as GRRM conducts.]
Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener [continues in background]

Soloist
One wiener, next to another wiener

Chorus
Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener [continues in background]

Soloist
Two wieners alongside yet another wiener

Chorus
Party, wiener party, wiener party, party party, wiener party, wiener wiener [continues in background]

Soloist
Soft wieners, nice and soft, non-erect wieners!

Chorus
Keep them flopping, flopping wieners, floppy floppy, dangle wieners, dangle dangle [continues in background]

Soloist
Five wieners in my face

Scott
Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! [Chorus is silent]
GRRM
But this is the best part. Right before King Joffrey gets poisoned, everyone flaps their wieners all around his face.
Scott
Jeaaaaah!
Butters
[gets off the sofa] Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
GRRM
Okay, okay, fine fine. What kind of pizzas do you want?
Butters
What kind do we want?!
Scott
He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet!
GRRM
Don't worry! They're coming! Not just two pizzas, there's, there's gonna be five! And they're gonna be huge! You won't believe it!
Butters
Come on, Scott! We're leaving! [helps Scott off the sofa, and they're about to leave]
GRRM
Wait, I haven't told you what happens yet!
Butters
NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
GRRM
Well why didn't you say so? I can help with that.
Butters
Whatoyou mean?
GRRM
I'll make some calls. I know a way to make sure you're completely prepared for Black Friday! [starts dialing]
Kenny's backyard. The PS4 army is at attention. The Sony President and his chief officers are there. The President presents the box to Kenny
President
Sony PS4 no urazuke. Zenbu. Domo sumimasen. ["For your support of the Sony PS4, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all of you"]
Aide
The President of Sony bids you thanks for all your support of the PS4.
President
Sore kara kono gifuto de Princess no Pawaa agemashou ["After that, let us give you this gift, the Power of the Princess"]
Aide
He offers you this gift to once and for all make you an official Princess, and to give you the powers you need to win this war on Black Friday. [The president kneels, opens the box, and shows off the brooch resting within it. Kenny leaves the throne and takes the brooch from its box]
President
Ima kara ["From now on"]... Princess Kenny!
Craig
Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess.
Kenny
(Wooo!) [as J-pop music plays, Kenny's backyard is transformed. The makeshift thrown becomes a gazebo with a unicorn bust on top, Kenny gets a magical girl look, with big anime eyes, and gets the power of the rainbow, with bubbles, etc. He gets a pet unicorn. The whole scene could be an intro for a Princess Kenny show.]
South Park Mall, night. The 'White Walker' crowd is beginning to cross the street
Guard 9
Oh God. We're done for!
Randy
My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us. [his phone rings and he picks up] Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!
Outside the mall. The 'Walker' crowd army is closing in on the entrance. Channel 9 News is on the scene
Niles
Tom, we have breaking news from the South Park mall. In an effort to make sure everyone is prepared, the mall has decided to push Black Friday by one week!
Crowd
[turns and looks at him] What?
Niles
The genius idea was proposed by George R. R. Martin, who also suggested "Fuck it, let's push Thanksgiving to December 3rd." For pushing the date, the mall is now reducing Black Friday prices to 96% off to the first hundred people inside the mall! [the shoppers begin to fight each other] This is going to be a fucking bloodbath, Tom. There will be medical tents, ambulances, face-painting, no doubt a lot of people you know and love are going to die! [an elderly man holding up a 96% off flier lets out a dragon's roar]
End of A Song of Ass and Fire

Titties and Dragons
Previously on South Park. Some clips of the previous episodes are shown as a summary. A clip featuring the Canadian Minister of Health is included just for kicks. The intro follows, with the Wiener song from last episode playing. Then follows the Princess Kenny Japanese anime-style animation. The segment begins at Sony Headquarters. Three men are in the president's office. One looks out the window while the second talks to the president

Kenny

At sea, day. A Sony cargo ship is stopped in its tracks by three smaller Microsoft ships
Captain
Baka! Kora wa sugoi cheating desu! ["Idiot! This is amazing cheating!"]

Kenny
Minna-san! Kenni kimasu! ["Everyone, Kenny has arrived"]
Deckhand
[elated] Aaaaah! [His eyes become loving stars]
Return to normal South Park animation style and open on XBox Army headquarters, day. Cartman is in a lawn chair talking to Kyle and Clyde. He's not pleased with what he's hearing.
Cartman
[nose in left hand] He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and he what??
Clyde
Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.
Cartman
Because, because what? Because he's cute?
Kyle
Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
Cartman
But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
Liane
[appears in the sliding door] Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.
Cartman
Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom! [she turns around and goes back inside. Cartman reconsiders] Mom? [she looks back at him] Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. [she walks out of view]
Kyle
This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
Cartman
He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
Kyle
Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
Cartman
So what are you saying, Kyle?!
Kyle
I have an idea. [turns around and walks off a bit] I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
South Park Mall, night. A huge crowd of people waits to get in, and minor scuffles pop up from time to time. Niles reports
Niles
Tom, Black Friday is finally almost here, and as you can see behind me, holiday shoppers are really getting antsy. People have been waiting out here since midnight on Thanksgiving. They're cold, they're starving, and there's already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals. Joining me now is Rick Tellmore, [balding shopper] who's been out here for six days, and your five year old son was eaten. Is that correct?
Rick
Yes, yes that's right, we had to eat him. We were all sort of starving out here, so we drew straws, and he drew the shortest one.
Niles
What is it you're hoping to get when Black Friday does finally start?
Rick
A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks.
Niles
Now, some people might say that eating your child is not very Christmasy. What would you say to them?
Rick:
[thinks a long time]
Iiii...
ate my son for a Blu-ray play-er
With a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle jang-le
My son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho! 
[as Niles speaks, he moves off, singing]
Ho ho jingle jing-le
Jingle jingle jang-le
Jingle jingle jingle ho ho!

Niles
No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park Mall. Back to you, Tom.
PS4 Army's medieval tent headquarters, day. Stan looks over a crude, cardboard, scale model of the mall, with troop locations indicated by Lego men
Stan
Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here. [points to the location] Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. [points to a location outside cardboard Red Robin]
Craig
At Red Robin?
Jimmy
That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.
Stan
The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
Craig
So how do we take over Black Robin?
Stan
I have no idea.
Pete
[appearing at the tent's entrance] Hey uh, excuse me?
Stan
Yes?
Pete
The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?
Stan
What? [moments later, outside, Stan walks towards Cartman as the two armies face each other]
Kyle
Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
Cartman
Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
Craig
Haha.
Cartman
Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
Clyde
Nobody saw that coming.
Kyle
Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
Stan
So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. [turns around and walks away]
Cartman
We know a way inside the Red Robin. [this stops Stan, Jimmy and Craig] You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
Kyle
Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
Craig
Hey, that could work.
Kyle
Let's do this together, dude. [Stan turns around and goes back] Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
Stan
And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
Kyle
[pledges with his right hand up and puts his left hand behind his back] I swear, Stan.
Stan
[turns around] Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. [as he walks away with Jimmy and Craig, the camera reveals that Kyle had his fingers on the hand behind his back crossed during the swear.]
Switch to Princess Kenny anime-style animation. Sony headquarters, day.
Sony President

Secretary 1
Kenni-chan, shitsure desu kedo. Wedding invitation kimashita. ["Kenny-chan, sorry to interrupt, but a wedding invitation has arrived."]
Kenny
Ha? Ueddingu? ["Huh? Wedding?" Kenny reads the front of the invitation: "You are invited to a wedding at Red Robin"]
Cartman
[Cartman's portrait, anime-style with a beard, voices over as Kenny reads the note inside the invitation.] Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
Kenny
Waaah? Sugoi-chan. ["What? Sweet!"]
Exec. 1
Purincessu Kenni ueddingu irimasu ne? ["Princess Kenny is going to be in a wedding, right?"]
Exec. 2

Exec. 1

Kenny
Minna-san, sayonara! Ima, Purincessu Kenni tomodachi ni kaerimasu! ["Goodbye, everyone! Princess Kenny is going back home to her friends!" Kenny jumps out the window... and drops straight down. She crashes into the street below and leaves a big puddle of blood]

The Office
Ahh, kawaii! [The men's eyes turn to hearts, the women's to happy upside-down U's--"Ahh, how cute!"]
Return to normal animation style. The Garden of Andros, yet again. Cartman walks with Stan now.
Cartman
Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
Stan
Yeah, sure, what about it?
Cartman
I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. [reaches out for a yellow rose]
Stan
Why?
Cartman
Well, think about it. [hands the rose to Stan, who takes it] The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
Stan
Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
Cartman
Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
Homeowner
He's lying to you! [Cartman gets annoyed, and he and Stan look at the homeowner] They're just acting like they've given up, but it's a double-bluff!
Cartman
Dude! Dude!
Homeowner
They're gonna betray you at the Red Robin wedding! He got the idea watching Game of Thrones!
Cartman
Dude, shut the fuck up!
Stan
Who is that?
Cartman
He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
Homeowner
They're gonna lock you in!
Cartman
God damn it, shut up!
Homeowner
He talked about it in my garden to like three other people! They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin and go get all the XBoxes! That's why he wants you to stay back from the doors!
Cartman
Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!
Stan
Did Kyle know about this?
Cartman
Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
Stan
Did Kyle know about this?!
Cartman
[sighs] Kyle thought of it. [Stan bolts out of there] Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude! [with Stan not returning, Cartman looks at the homeowner] You're a fuckin' asshole!
Homeowner
Fuck you, get out of my garden!
Cartman
I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
Homeowner
Go fuck yourself! [slams his bedroom window shut]
Channel 9 News
Tammy
Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here.
Tom
Niles Lawson is at the scene, and it's about time, Niles.
Niles
That's right Tom. Mall officials have said they are ready, and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon. [shown] This year's ribbon cutter is of course George R. R. Martin, who um, doesn't appear to have shown up yet, [a real-life photo of GRRM is shown] but uhh, says he is on his way. Just like the dragons and zombies in his novels, he is on his way.
Sure enough, two horses run through frozen New Mexico. One carries GRRM, the other carries Butters and Scott, who has passed out from lack of eating
Butters
Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
GRRM
That may be true, but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation.
Butters
What's that? [looks around, than below, his horse] Awww! [horse is shown with a huge semi-hard penis.]
Red Robin, day. As the boys and Red Robin workers go about preparing the restaurant for a wedding, Cartman talks to the manager. After hanging up a "Happy Wedding" banner, Clyde and Craig come down some ladders
Cartman
Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
Manager
Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?
Cartman
Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
Manager
It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!
Cartman
Yesh, kewl.
Manager
So Beyoncé is not with Jay-Z anymore?
Cartman
Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
Manager
Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?
Cartman
Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
Kyle
[rushes up] Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
Cartman
Yes, he did.
Kyle
Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
Cartman
[shushes Kyle up and walks him a few steps] It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
Kyle
[getting alarmed] What the hell did you do??
Cartman
What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
Kyle
No. Tell me you didn't!
Stan's house, evening. Sharon takes Kyle up to Stan's room and briefs him on Stan's trouble
Sharon
He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.
Kyle
Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.
Sharon
And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
Kyle
Ok-okay. [watches her leave, walks over to Stan's door and knocks] Stan? Stan?
Stan
[startled out of his sleep] Huh? Hello? Who is that? [next to him is a glass of milk, a sandwich with a bite in it, and a tin cup]
Kyle
Stan, it's me.
Stan
Get out of here!
Kyle
Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
Stan
You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
Kyle
You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
Stan
[stands and turns to address Kyle] I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
Kyle
You didn't?
Stan
...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
Kyle
I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
Stan
You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
Kyle
[lets his head fall on the door] Stan, don't say that.
Stan
Get out of here! I'm done with you! [grabs the tin cup and raps it against his bedroom 'jail cell' door as in classic prison movies] Mom! Mom! [Kyle stands up straight] Get him out of here! [Sharon arrives, and Kyle back away from the door] Get him out! [Kyle leaves]
Inside the currently empty South Park Mall atrium, night. Randy addresses the other guards
Randy
Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die! [points to the main entrance] When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk! [a blond guard begins to weep] Stay tough, rookie.
Guard 6
We're not gonna make it, sir.
Randy
We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
Guard 6
Okay.
Randy
OKAY?!
Guard 6
Yes sir! Yes sir.
Randy
Not one more good person dies on my watch! [all of a sudden, shoppers break through the skylight on the upper level]
Guard 3
Oh my God!
Guard 8
They're comin' in through the roof!
Guard 6
[begins to back away] I can't do this! I'm sorry! I can't do this! [runs off, and now there are seven]
Randy
Stay at your post! [an arrow pierces the fleeing guard's back right chest. Randy is shown again, holding the bow from which the arrow came] Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
South Park Mall, day. A helicopter shot of the crowd outside the mall.
Niles
Here we go, Tom. George R. R. Martin has finally arrived to cut the red ribbon. [GRRM is shown behind the red ribbon with scissors in hand]
GRRM
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to be here this morning on behalf of South Park Mall Partners and channel 9 News, your go-to source for news, weather, and sports.
Shopper 8
Just do it! [the shoppers in front crouch down, ready to run inside]
GRRM
Very well. In the tradition of our ancestors, [lowers the scissors to a cutting position] let's bring in the holidays! [more jockeying for position. GRRM pulls up at the last moment and closes the scissors] But first, I'd like to share with you a few words about my wiener.
Crowd
AAAWWWW!! [off to one side, where the crowd can't see, the Goth kids approach Red Robin]
Manager
Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.
Pete
Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding.
Manager
Oh great, go right on in. [smiles and lets them in]
Red Robin, inside. The theme is medieval times, with the boys in costume. Both houses - House PS4 and House XBox - are present. Jimmy plays the flute while Craig accompanies him on tambourine in a medieval style song.
Cartman
Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s. [all cheer] And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.
Kenny
(My boobs? You flatter me, Grand Wizard!)
Cartman
Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit. [leaves the table and goes to the mall-side entrance, where Clyde is keeping watch] What have you found out?
Clyde
The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
Cartman
Oh okay, that could be a while. [turns away from the door] All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
At the mall entrance...
GRRM
O soft and pink with purple head.
Gently you lay with me on my bed.
Shopper 9
Get on with it, George R. R. Martin! [the rest of the crowd rallies behind him]
GRRM
"Growl, growl" calls the wiener from on high
A little tiny wiener, still so pleasing to the eye.

Shopper 10
Enough with the wieners already!
Shopper 11
Yeah, come on!
Back at Red Robin... Cartman is back from the restroom and looks over to the mall entrance
Cartman
Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
Kyle
[approaches Cartman and Kenny's table] Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! [the PS4 soldiers immediately brandish their weapons and aim them at the XBox soldiers. Tweek advances on Token with an armed bow. Kenny has his sword under Cartman's chin]
Cartman
What the hell is this?!
Kyle
I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
Cartman
Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
Kyle
I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
Cartman
Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
Kyle
The fight is over, Cartman!
Gates
[walks into view] It's not over. Looks like I came just in time.
Cartman
Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
Sony President
[walks into view and speaks in very thick accent] You will not interfere, Bill Gates! These-a children will get their PS4s!
Kenny
(The Sony president's here too, desu ka? ["Is that the Sony president here, too?"])
Kyle
Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
Cartman
They're not a part of your betrayal?
Kyle
No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
Cartman
No. Whose betrayal is this? [the sound of chains comes from the mall entrance - Stan locks the doors, then turns around]
Stan
We're done with betrayals! It's time to put an end to this!
Kyle
Stan?
Inside the mall...
Guard 3
Sir? Sir, Operations just said they need one of us to unlock the door to Red Robin to let some wedding party inside the mall!
Randy
Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
Guard 3
Tom Hanks and Beyoncé.
Randy
What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé! [runs towards Red Robin] I've gotta save them!
Back at Red Robin...
Stan
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block. [stops between the two presidents] Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad? [throws his sword at the Sony president] Then you fucking fight!
Sony President
Huh? [strokes the wooden sword] Sou...["I see..."]
Gates
Then let's finish it! [begins to unbutton his shirt] You and me!
Sony President
Ikimashou! ["Let's go!"]
Gates
[now topless, he is fully covered in MS-13 gang tattoos. Prominent chest tattoo is "MS-DOS"] Winner take all!
Cartman
Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
Sony President
Then let this be your last fight, Bill Gates. [Gates throws the first punch, then follows up with a few kicks. The Sony president comes back with a right hook. The kids look on in horror as the men fight unarmed. Butters finally shows up.]
Butters
Hey, fellas. What did I miss? [smiles]
At the main mall entrance, GRRM is still expounding on wieners
GRRM
Look at this wiener. [unzips his pants] Judge it by its size?
Rub it three times and it has a surprise. [Shopper 4 joins GRRM after GRRM exposes his penis and opens up a switchblade]
Shopper 4
That's it! You're not delaying this anymore, you wiener-loving bitch! [slices off GRRM's penis and throws it into the crowd, which cheers wildly. Shopper 4 cuts the ribbon, and the crowd surges into the mall. The six remaining guards are powerless against the crowd]
Guard 8
Happy holidays, Rick. [grabs Rick's hand and holds it as the crowd surges forward]
Rick
And to you, my friend. [Utter chaos. The guards are overpowered and trampled on. The shoppers break into the stores, destroying windows and looting. One man dies impaled on a broken window. A lot of adults grab "Stop Touching Me Elmo"s]
Shopper 12
Grab it Rebecca! Grab it [has her girl stretching out to grab an Elmo from the top shelf. Another woman comes up behind her and hits her with a bat, knocking the Elmo out of the girl's hands. The second woman is herself thrown into a shelf by a man.]
Shopper 2
[Morbidly obese shopper throwing people out of her way left and right] Kiss my fat vagina!
Shopper 13
[combat music starts in imitation of "Game of Thrones" credit music as shopper 13 competes with other shoppers to grab items from a cardboard box] Gimme that camera! Give it up! [live-action archived footage from a rush on Cabbage Patch Kids, and more from Walmart and Target]
Randy
Get back! Get out of my way! [his phone rings and he answers it] Commander Marsh?
Sharon
Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!
Randy
WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!
Back at Red Robin, Bill Gates finishes off the Sony president with five head smashes into the ground.
Gates
This... is over... Now... you die! {cracks the president's head open and creates a pool of blood, then throwing him into a wall for good measure. The president's brain is exposed. Tired and breathless, Gates walks over to a table and leans on it a little] It's over. XBox... wins! [no one is happy about this.]
Cartman
[flatly] Yay, XBox wins.
Stan
[flatly] Yay.
Randy
[unlocks the doors and opens them] Stan! You're alive! I saved you! [falls on to his knees] It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! [falls over, exhausted]
Gates
Go on, kids. [gasps] Go get your XBoxes. [the kids silently leave Red Robin. Music changes to a solo piano playing "Oh Christmas Tree" in imitation of "A Charlie Brown Christmas". Eleven of them walk through the mall, through a sea of bodies and blood, and up to the second floor on an escalator]
Elmo
[on an adjacent escalator] Can Elmo smell your genitals? [the boys walk over to EVGames]
EVGames Clerk
[unscathed, despite the destruction to his shop] Happy holidays, guys. What can I interest ya in? [the shelf behind him, full of PS4s and XB1s, is surprisingly unscathed]
Cartman
We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
EVGames Clerk
Good choice! [gives the boys a thumbs up]
Channel 9 news report set in front of parking lot full of dead shoppers. "A Charlie Brown Christmas" piano music still underscores.
Randy
[Silently carries a flat panel television past the mass of dead bodies.]
Niles
Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News.
Cartman's house, afternoon. The eleven who went to EVGames - Timmy, Tweek, Craig, Clyde, Kenny, Token, Kyle, Butters, Jimmy, Cartman, Stan - and Scott are in the living room. Cartman and Stan are playing while the others are behind them, watching.
Cartman
The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
Stan
Yes, it is.
Butters
The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
Jimmy
Yeah that's that's that's pretty nice. [the game falls silent]
Cartman
You guys wanna p-play outside or something? [the boys glance around at each other. Soon the sliding door opens and the boys walk out onto the back yard]
Kyle
Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
Cartman
I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
Stan
Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
Cartman
The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
The Boys
Yeah, you're right. You make a point.
Cartman
Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this. [grabs a stick from the ground] We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
The Boys
Yeah!
Cartman
[holds the stick up high in the sun] Fuck 'em!
Quick commercial. A box for The Stick of Truth appears onscreen
Announcer
The South Park video game, coming to stores soon!
Butters
[pops up onscreen] Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
End of Titties and Dragons

The Hobbit
South Park Elementary Gym, day. The cheerleaders are at practice
Cheerleaders
Yeah yeah, do we rock?!
Yeah yeah, take it to the top!
Yeah yeah, are we gonna stop?!
No way! No way!

Wendy
Cheer Squad roll call! [each cheerleader steps forward, announces her name, and steps back]
Heidi
Heidi!
Nichole
Nichole!
Bebe
Bebe!
Lola
Lola!
Red
Red!
Annie
Annie!
Lisa
[slowly steps forward and speaks slowly] Lisa Berger. [this brings down the other cheerleaders]
Annie
Oh God.
Red
Here we go.
Nichole
Ugh.
Bebe
Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
Wendy
You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?
Lisa
But I'm the fat one.
Wendy
What?
Lisa
Every cheerleading squad has a fat ugly cheerleader and that's me.
Wendy
See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?
Heidi
There's only one boy that Lisa cares about.
Red
Yeah, Lisa has a crush on Butters.
Lisa
Shut up!
Wendy
But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?
Lisa
No way. I I'd just get made fun of.
Wendy
Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!
The cafeteria, later. Kenny, Cartman, Tweek, Craig, Clyde, and Butters are seated at table, with Butters recounting something
Butters
So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says "I"-
Lisa
Uh, excuse me. Butters?
Butters
[confused for a moment, then looks over his left shoulder] Oh. Yes?
Lisa
Um, well, I was just wondering if... [strokes her hair] maybe... [brings her arm down] you would like to go to a movie this weekend.
Butters
Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
Lisa
[casts her eyes down] Okay, thanks.
Butters
See ya, Lisa! [Esther overhears the conversation from the next table and looks over her shoulder at Butters]
Craig
Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.
Clyde
At least she didn't try to sit on him. [the other boys at the table laugh, except Cartman]
Cartman
You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
The hallway, later. Butters is at his locker
Butters
Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
[Wendy comes to view at the end of the hall and spots him, then walks up to him]
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-

Wendy
[grabs his locker door and slams it shut] What the fuck is your problem?!
Butters
Oh. Hey Wendy.
Wendy
Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
Butters
Am I just an asshole?
Wendy
Yeah!
Butters
Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
Wendy
Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
Butters
Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
Wendy
She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!
Butters
Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
Wendy
What?!
Butters
I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women. [opens his locker again. On the door are several pinup posters of Kim Kardashian] I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect everything.
Wendy
[grabs the poster] This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!
Butters
You're a liar!
Wendy
Look it up, stupid! [crushes the poster into a wad] In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit! [throws the wadded-up poster to the floor and walks away. As Butters reaches for the poster, Wendy turns around] You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! [turns around and goes around the corner. Butters unwads the poster]
Mr. Mackey's office, later. Butters is in there with Mr. Mackey, crying. Wendy walks in a few seconds later
Mr. Mackey
Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it.
Wendy
[noticing Butters] Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!
Mr. Mackey
Uh, no Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit.
Wendy
...Are you serious?
Butters
You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
Wendy
That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian!
Mr. Mackey
Uh but, but Wendy, Kim Kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful, mkay?
Wendy
Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.
Butters
Oh, she said it again!
Mr. Mackey
Now, Wendy, Kim might be uh, full-figured, but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters, mkay?! Have you stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're jel?
Wendy
I'm not "jel", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!
Mr. Mackey
Uh that may be true, but there is a very fine line, Wendy, between being a feminist and being a hater, mkay? And you're gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl who's jelly!
Room 7, later. Class is in session. Mr. Garrison stands before the class
Mr. Garrison
Okay kids, there have been some hurtful and hateful things being said around this school, and so we are gonna hear from a guest speaker. Here to explain why Kim Kardashian is not a hobbit, please welcome, Aquaman. [goes to his desk as Kanye West enters the room. The class claps]
Kanye
Uh-huh. Uh-huh, that's right
Cartman
[recognizing him] Uh oh.
Kanye
[enunciating] Okay, first of all, I am NOT Aquaman, I am a recovering... gay fish. Yes, I have met Aquaman. I have hung out with Aquaman. But the only thing I have in common with Aquaman anymore is my love for the sea. [adjusting his pants] Now! [clears his throat] There have been malicious rumors, started at this elementary school, that my beautiful fiancée is a hobbit. That is not funny, and it is not true. [Wendy's eyes are glazing over] Alright?! Yes, Kim is heavier than most of her pictures show her to be. Yes, she gets her hair lasered off her body. Yes, she has a friend named Gandalf who happens to be a wizard. [finds himself trapped by that last statement, and backs up] I'm sorry, excuse me a minute. [calls Kim up and turns his back on the class...] Bitch, how are you not a hobbit again? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah right. Right right right right right, yeah. Okay. Yep. Yep. Let me get- okay. Yep, I got it. Okay, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and turns to the class.] Okay, if my fiancée Kim… is… a hobbit, then how come… it uh how c- then, okay, if she's a hobbit, then how come she don't live in a hole in the ground? BOOOOOOM! All y'all just got lit up, cuz! She don't live in no hole in the ground, she lives in a big-ass mansion, with me, in her room, that is slightly below ground! So, you can… She, she is sexy, and womanly, and she smokes a pipe. She can blow them rings that go up over her head, and… Hold up.[calls Kim up again and turns his back on the class...] Bitch, you not a hobbit, right? ... No, I know, you just, you smoke that long pipe sometimes when you sit by the fire... Oh it's a- Oh, okay. Got it, got it- What do you call it? Yep. Yep, got it. Okay. Yep, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and turns to the class.] That is not a hobbit pipe, for your information! It is a personal oral humidifier to keep all the wrinkles around her mouth from showin'. So haha, all you haters, HA!
South Park Elementary, day. Butters walks down the hall when the computer lab door opens and Wendy peeks out
Wendy
Butters. Butters, come here for a sec.
Butters
Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
Wendy
Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?
Butters
Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! [she goes back inside, and Butters follows her in]
Wendy
I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?
Butters
Okay.
Wendy
Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides [she trims them down a bit]. We select the eyes [makes the glasses more rectangular and shorter, and adds eye makeup], make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin [the freckles go], lengthen the neck [moves the head up], add more to the hair [gives Lisa longer, wavy hair], select the lips and make them fuller [removes the harelip], take out any puffiness on the skin [reduces the cheeks] here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin [this gives Lisa hips], streamline the shoulders [making the arms thinner in the process], put highlights in the eyes [gives her a nose], and, there.
Butters
That's Lisa Berger?
Wendy
Do you see what I'm talking about?
Butters
She's pretty!
Wendy
That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
Butters
Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
Wendy
What? What do you mean?
Butters
And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this [sends it off] and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. [runs out of the lab]
Wendy
Butters!
South Park Elementary, afternoon. Cartman is at his locker. Butters walks into view carrying flowers and a gift.
Butters
Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger? [walks over to Cartman] Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
Cartman
I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
Butters
II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
Cartman
Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
Butters
What?! Well since when?
Cartman
Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. [next shot is of Clyde walking down the hall with Lisa on his arm as he looks at his phone's screen. Everyone turns and stares at the new couple. They stop at Token at his locker]
Clyde
Hey Token. Token, check out my girlfriend. [shows him the Photoshopped picture instead of the real deal]
Token
Wow, she's hot.
Clyde
Yeah, we just started dating seriously. [walks over to Tweek at his locker] You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?
Tweek
Oh man, you're a lucky guy.
Clyde
Yeah, I know. [walks off. Tweek turns back to his locker. The couple walks by Craig, Kevin, and two other boys]
Craig
Hey Clyde. Nice score, dude.
Other boys
Yeah.
Clyde
Oh, thanks, guys. [they walk by Wendy, who's speechless]
Jimmy
[walks up to Stan] Hey Stan, did you see Clyde's going out with Lisa B-b-Berger?
Stan
Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics. [Wendy walks up to them, mad] She got really hot all of a sudden.
Jimmy
Yeah. I wouldn't mind t-tah-t-tappin' that ass.
Wendy
Excuse me!
Stan
Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
Wendy
Why would I be jel?
Jimmy
Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy.
Wendy
She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!
Stan
She looks pretty hot here.
Wendy
Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! [just then, Lisa and Clyde walk past her, but she doesn't see this. Jimmy does, though.]
Jimmy
That's not very nice, Wendy.
Lisa
What's your problem, Wendy?
Wendy
[looks and quickly assesses the situation] I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa.
Lisa
You're just a hater. Why don't you mind your own business instead of being jelly?
Wendy
I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!
Clyde
It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. [walks off with Lisa]
Lisa
Thanks, babe.
Mr. Mackey's office. Wendy is back in there, heh
Mr. Mackey
Now Wendy, I've tried to be patient with you 'cause you've always been a good student! M'kay?! But calling a little girl fat and ugly is NEVER m'kay!
Wendy
Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-
Mr. Mackey
No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school!
Wendy
Jelly school?
Mr. Mackey
That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?! [picks up the receiver and starts pressing keys on the keypad] I'm sorry about this, but it's gone too far! I've had it![puts the receiver up to his ear] Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior!
Wendy
Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.
Mr. Mackey
Yuh, you do? Okay, well I'm not actually on the phone with a... jelly school, Wendy, okay?
Wendy
Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.
Mr. Mackey
Okay, well Wendy, I'm just tryin' to uh- Oh, bye, jelly school. [hangs up the phone] Uh, Wendy, I'm just tryin' to make you understand how serious it is when you lash out at other girls.
Wendy
Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change.
Mr. Mackey
M-okay.
Time Magazine Person Of The Year Award presentation. A man announces the award, a woman holds it up
Host
Ladies and Gentlemen, it my my honor to give the Person of the Year award to this year's winner, Pope Francis. [fanfare plays as the pope comes out from the audience and goes on stage. He takes the mic]
Pope Francis
Gracias, gracias, all of my children.
Kanye
[rushes up and takes the mic from the pope] Alright hold up! Hold up! I'm sorry pope, but hold up! I just gotta say this! If my fiancée is a hobbit, then uh, [turns away and calls Kim up]Then what, bitch? Okay, yeah yeah [turns back to the audience] Okay, if she... was... if she is a hobbit, then, how come she don't turn blue when goblins are near? [jumps] Oh, you didn't think of that! Oh, I guess she's not a hobbit then! She must be a beautiful, sexy woman!
Pope Francis
[grabs the mic for a moment and enunciates] The hobbit doesn't turn blue around goblins, just his sword does.
Kanye
Man, get the fuck out of here, you hobbit trivia bitch! [shoves the pope away, and the pope leaves] Who the fuck asked you?! [turns to the audience again] Nobody is talkin' any more shit about my woman! Alright?! She is gorgeous! If she was here, you could all see for yourselves how beautiful she is! But she can't be here because she has a movie comin' out on Friday, directed by Peter Jackson, called The Hobbit! Hold up. [turns away and calls Kim up] Bitch, that movie you got comin' out is called The Hobbit? ... Yeah, but it- ... What? It's what? Ohhh yeah. Yup. Yeah, I got it. Yup. Yup. Lemme tell them. Love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and turns to the audience.] Kim is not even in that movie! That movie is just loosely based on her television show, Keepin' Up With The Kardashians, which is a show about short, loud, little people living in a fantasy world! Hold. Up![turns away and calls Kim up] Bitch, if you're the hobbit, you need to let me know right now, 'cause I'm makin' a fool of myself out here!
South Park Elementary Gym, day. The cheerleaders are performing during a game break
Cheerleaders:
Yeah yeah, do we rock?!
Yeah yeah, take it to the top!
Yeah yeah, are we gonna stop?!
No way! No way!

Wendy
Cheer Squad roll call! [each cheerleader steps forward, announces her name, and steps back]
Heidi
Heidi!
Nichole
Nichole!
Bebe
Bebe!
Lola
Lola!
Red
Red!
Annie
Annie!
Lisa
Lisa Berger! [the kids all cheer]
Wendy
And I'm your captain, Wendy! [silence. One kindergartner comes out of the bleachers with a picture of Lisa and has Lisa sign it. More cheers, and Lisa waves at the audience]
South Park Elementary Gym, after the game. Wendy is upset that she got no cheers from the audience
Red
Look, Wendy, we are all very happy for Lisa, okay? Nobody here is jelly. But the boys aren't even noticing the rest of us anymore.
Bebe
All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
Wendy
I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!
Heidi
Why?! Don't you care about us?!
Wendy
Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! [turns left and walks away]
Lisa
[to the cheerleaders' left] Hey girls. [dressed in a hot outfit] Don't be sad. If you wanna look really hot, like me, you just gotta be willing to sweat. Get down to the gym and work!
Total-Self Image, day, inside. The cheerleaders await instructions from a coach
Coach
Alright girls, we're gonna trim that fat and tone those bodies. Let's do this! You first! [points to Bebe] Get right up there! [gets on a treadmill. The coach quickly moves around the treadmill and begins taking pictures] Alright, now look here. [Bebe quickly figures out what she needs to do and begins posing. Later on...] Come on, burn it off! You got this! [Bebe is shown editing the pictures the coach just took. She puts blush on her cheeks, lipstick on her lips, blonde eyebrows on her eyes, a fuller body of hair... Next, Red edits her picture. She puts on a cute, tiny smile and eye makeup. Annie removes the fat around her torso and augments her breasts, Heidi gives herself a new hairstyle, Nichole gets more tone and a shorter neck, tighter cheeks, straighter hair, eyebrows, a lighter shade of brown, eye makeup, lipstick, a more level head, fuller lips, breasts. Next is Lisa performing in a video, a parody of "Work Bitch". Next is a shot of the girls looking at their Photoshopped selves.]
Coach
[to Lola] Look at those thighs! Come on, you've gotta push harder! [Lola removes some fat from her midsection and gives herself a bow on her shirt, then straightens out her head. Even Timmy, who isn't a cheerleader, gets the Photoshop treatment. His wheelchair is removed, he's given proper, working legs, his shirt is lengthened and given a collar, he's given more hair and his eyes are made to look forward, his mouth is fixed and he's given a coat. Red drinks from a water bottle while Lola is sweating from the hard work. All the while, Lisa raps]
Lisa
You wanna?
You, you, you wanna?
You wanna?
You wanna look pretty?
You want a boyfriend?
You want a nice ass?
You better work out, slut!
You want nice things?
You want boys to give you nice things?
You better work out, slut!
Now get to work, slut!
Party in the cookie trough!
Party in the cookie trough!
Party in the cookie trough!
You better work out, whore!

South Park Elementary, playground, day. The boys are gathered on the merry-go-round, looking at pictures of the cheerleaders on Craig's phone.
The Boys
Wooowww!
Jimmy
Wow! Wow! She looks great!
Cartman
Whoa, look at Bebe! [her picture is shown] I had no idea Bebe was that hot.
Craig
Yeah, but did you see Token's girlfriend? [flips through the pictures until he gets to Nichole]
The Boys
Wooowww!
Clyde
Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.
Butters
No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! [Craig flips back to her]
Kyle
Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
Cartman
Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
Butters
I do love water balloons. [the boys fall silent and continue viewing the pictures. Stan gets sad and leaves; viewing all those pictures, not one of them of Wendy, disheartened him]
The school hallway, moments later. Wendy is at her locker, and Stan approaches
Stan
Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
Wendy
[curt] What?
Stan
A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
Wendy
So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!
Stan
Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
Wendy
Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
Stan
[looks down] I do? [kids begin to walk by]
Wendy
Yeah. [begins to point out other kids' defects] And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders. [The cheerleaders come into view and approach Wendy and Stan. Neither of them notices] The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nichole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair. [Mr. Mackey walks in on the rant] And Heidi Turner's butt is flat! [Wendy turns to leave, but runs into the cheerleaders and Mr. Mackey] Oh God damn it!
Bebe
[furious] You! HATER!
Mr. Mackey
[incensed] WENDY, IN MY OFFICE, RIGHT NOW! OKAY?!
Wendy
Ugh!
Kanye West video, a spoof of "Bound 2"
Kanye (backup singers)
(Oh yeah, babe. Oh yeah, baby.)
One thing I know, my girl ain't no hobbit.
She might be stumpy; that don't mean she a hobbit.
She's not a hobbit 'cause she couldn't be.
She got no Bagginses in her family tree.
Yes on occasion she hangs out with her dwarf friends.
But she never went on no quest with her dwarf friends.
Except for one time she went to kill that dragon.
She took his gold and she- [he stops the video shoot]

Hang on a minute, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [calls up Kim yet again] Bitch, remember when you went off to kill that dragon with them dwarves? ... Yeah. Oh yeah. Rightrightrightright, yup. Yup, I got it. Yep, love you too. [blows two quick kisses at the phone, hangs up, and resumes the shoot.]

It wasn't no dragon, so my girl ain't no hobbit.
That was a Quizno's and my bitch went to rob it.
'Cause they got that ham that she robs on her cellulite.
While she drinking her grog and singin' those merry songs... at night...
My girl ain't no hobbit.
Please God, tell me I'm not engaged to no hobbit. 
(Kim is not a hobbit.)

South Park Elementary Gym, day. The cheerleaders are at practice
Cheerleaders
Who are you yelling for? South Park! Let's go Cows!
Who are you yelling for? South Park! Let's go Cows!

Heidi
Heidi!
Nichole
Nichole!
Bebe
Bebe!
Lola
Lola!
Red
Red!
Annie
Annie!
Lisa
Lisa Berger!
Wendy
[slowly steps forward and speaks softly] Wendy.
Nichole, Lola, Annie
Ugh.
Bebe
You suck!
Heidi
Oh God.
Red, Annie
Ugh.
Bebe
Can we try this without Wendy?
Lola
I agree!
Lisa
[steps forward] Hey, come on, you guys. She just needs more confidence. [to Wendy] It's okay, Wendy. Who care if no one likes you? Maybe you should go out with Butters.
Wendy
Let's just get back to cheering, okay?!
Heidi
I don't think so! We don't wanna cheer with a hater!
Bebe
Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!
Annie
Yeah!
Lola
Uh huh!
Red
That's right!
Wendy
See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far! [leaves] And if society won't fix it, I will!
Bebe
What are you gonna do?!
Wendy
[stops just outside the gym] Something that should have been done a long time ago! [walks away]
Channel 9 Morning News, with Tom and Tammy Thompson
Announcer
It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson.
Tammy
A little girl is making big waves with her fight against Photoshop.
Tom
Nine-year-old Wendy Testaburger has started a campaign, and tomorrow will speak before the state senate to ban the use of Photoshopped images, saying they're harmful to young girls. [a taped interview is shown.] Young lady, what is your message?
Wendy
Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
Tom
And you're not just... being a hater.
Wendy
...Nooo.
Tom
'Cause sometimes, girls who aren't well-liked, you know, lash out at pretty and popular girls. Are, are you well-liked at your school?
Wendy
[thinks about it] Not lately, no.
Tom
Uh huh. But you're not being jelly?
Wendy
NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
Tom
Okay, because I do understand that the jelly school in Aurora is ready to take you in. Is that right, Rick?
Rick
Tom, I'm standing in front of the jelly school, where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl. We're being told if she doesn't stop the-
Wendy
That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!
Rick
[looks over his left shoulder] Well, okay, but, you are a hater.
Wendy
That's fine! [leaves her seat] People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!
The Testaburger house, Wendy's bedroom, night. Her bedroom door opens and a silhouette of Kanye is at the door. He walks in and closes the door, walks to her night stand and turns on the lamp. Wendy wakes up, looks, and jumps up
Wendy
Agh! What do you want?
Kanye
[sits on her chair and begins to read a sad story. He sniffs from time to time] Once upon a time, there was a little hobbit who lived in the forest. And all the hobbit ever wanted was to be beautiful. And even though she was short and fat and hairy, this little hobbit dreamed that one day she could be pretty like Beyoncé. [clears his throat] And then one day, along came a magic power, called Photoshop. And just like that, poof, the little hobbit was beautiful. And even though she still couldn't sing like Beyoncé, or dance like Beyoncé, or act like Beyoncé, or be a decent human being like Beyoncé, the little hobbit was looked up to and loved, just like Beyoncé! [takes a tissue from Wendy's tissue box and wipes away his tears with it] Soon she had money, and adoration, and a hip-hop fiancée who loved her very much- [turns away, getting choked up] I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up, I'm sorry. [returns to reading] Everything was good for the hobbit. But then this mean little girl, called the Jelly Monster, she was sooo jelly of the hobbit that she told everyone she was a liar, and the hobbit's fiancée realized she was just a hobbit. And you know what he said? He said "I don't CARE!" And then the jelly monster came and tried to take the magic power away from the little hobbit, so the hobbit prayed to God, and God said "Don't worry, little hobbit. I will go find this jelly monster girl, and I will read her a story and melt her icy heart." And the hobbit said "Thank you," and the hobbit and God lived happily ever after in the shower forever 'cause I love her so much! [breaks down and cries] I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. I'm sorry.
Wendy
Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.
Kanye
[still a wreck] Sorry, hold up, I'm sorry, it's okay. Hold up, hold on, I'm sorry.
Wendy
No no, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.
Kanye
Sorry, sorry, that's okay. I've been jelly before too. I'm sorry.
South Park Elementary, morning. As kids pass each other in the hall, Wendy is in the computer lab looking at her picture. She begins to edit it, First she gives her hair a new style, then lifts her beret an inch or two, and shrinks her head. She makes more changes and tears begin to well up in her eyes. She now has hips, breasts, lipstick, blush, eyebrows and eyelashes. She's done, and clicks the Send button, which brings up a confirmation box which asks "Mass Email File 'My Pic'?". She moves the cursor to "Yes". The mouse doesn't move after that, and she clicks on "Yes". She wipes away her tears, pushes herself away from the computer, and leaves the computer lab.
End of The Hobbit


Go Fund Yourself
South Park, outside. The risiing sun beats brightly on the town. Bouncy music plays as the boys' houses are visited. ]
Cartman's room. He's awake, staring at the ceiling, thinking.
Cartman
Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
Stan's kitchen. Stan is at the breakfast nook eating Astro Pops in milk, and he too is thinking.
Stan
Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
The bus stop. Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny await the bus.
Kyle
Barking vaginal belch.
Cartman
Protruding vaginal boner.
Kenny
(Dilapidated titties incorporated.)
Cartman
Oh, I like that. [the bus rolls up and the boys get on board]
Inside the bus.
Butters
[pops up out of his seat and looks behind it] Rotten boobie turds!
Stan
Nah.
Kyle
Bloody butt cough.
Stan
[passively] Uh huh.
A Law Office. Stan reads possible site names from a list he compiled from his friends' suggestions to a live domain name registrar.
Stan
Angry Clit Spasm
Registrar
[types the name into a whois and waits for results] Nope, sorry.
Stan
Whooping Fart Balls.
Registrar
Nnnnnope.
Stan
Lubricated Titty Burgers.
Registrar
That's taken too.
Stan
[frustrated] Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!
Registrar
Sorry.
Cartman
Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
Kyle
How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
Registrar
I told you, you just have to be really original with with your company name. There's a lot of startup company these days. [the boys look at each other]
Cartman
Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
Registrar
That's available! Congratulations!
The Kickstarted Web site. A new project appears on it: "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
Stan's room. There should be five boys there, but Cartman is missing.
Kyle
It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
Stan
Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
Butters
Man this sucks!
Randy
[opens the door and peeks in] Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
Stan
No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
Randy
A startup company? A company that does what?
Stan
No, we don't wanna do anything.
Kyle
Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
Butters
Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
Randy
Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
Stan
...Nnnno, there isn't. [turns back to his computer and fleshes out the project]
The neighborhood, day. Cartman runs down the sidewalk
Cartman
You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys! [runs up to Stan's door and enters the house. He runs into Stan's room] You guys, I've got it!
Stan
What?
Cartman
It's the greatest startup company name EVER! [Kyle and Stan move in closer to Cartman]
Kyle
What?! Tell us!
Cartman
Washington. Redskins. [Kyle and Stan look at each other]
Kyle
Washington Redskins?
Cartman
It's sooo sweet!
Stan
I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
Cartman
It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
Stan
[lowers his head and strokes his chin] Washington Redskins. [raises his head] I like it!
Kenny
(Me too!)
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
Kyle
Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
Cartman
Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
And so the boys get busy setting up a Washington Redskins office in town. Stan and Cartman put up a Redskins banner behind the desk. Kenny decorates the front of the desk. Stan finishes his part of the work and climbs down.
Stan
[walks up to Kyle] You alright dude?
Kyle
Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
Cartman
[climbs down the ladder and joins Stan and Kyle] It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
Kyle
Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
Cartman
We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys! [walks up to an easel with a 4 Point Plan on it] Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
Kyle
I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
Butters
[at the computer] We already got a dollar!
Stan
What?! [Cartman walks up to Butters]
Butters
One dollar pledge!
Kenny
(Yahoo!) [begins to dance]
Cartman
I told you guys! "Washington Redskins" totally gets people's attention!
Butters
Another two dollars!
Kyle
No way!
Cartman
Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
News 4 Update
News 4 Anchor
Another new startup company is gaining a lot of attention on the Internet. They're a company that does absolutely nothing, and they're called, the Washington Redskins. [the page loads and someone is scrolling through it] The Redskins started as what appeared to be some kind of adolescent prank, but almost overnight it has become one of the most heavily funded projects on Kickstarter. [scroll over, next is a teen boy] Why did you give five dollars to the Washington Redskins Kickstarter?
Teen Boy
I dunno, I just. Uh. They don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. I dunno, I thought it was funny.
Cartman
[on a video on the Kickstarter site] By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
News 4 Anchor
It's called crowd-funding, using the Internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal.
The new Redskins office. Cartman takes a call
Cartman
Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself. [Butters walks across the room] Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
Businessman
[walks in with two other men] You are Eric Cartman?
Cartman
Yes, I know.
Dan Snyder
My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins
Cartman
Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
Dan Snyder
Thank you, but I will stand.
Cartman
Nice, I like that.
Dan Snyder
Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization.
Cartman
Stop? But why?
Dan Snyder
Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!
Cartman
Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually. [phone rings, Eric reacts] Um, Butters, could you get that?
Butters
[next to the phone, answers it. Stan is on his iPhone] Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.
Dan Snyder
Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization "The Washington Redskins", its offensive to us?
Cartman
How is it offensive?
Coach
How is it offensive?! Jesus, what-?!
Dan Snyder
We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing!
Coach
Makes us feel like a joke
Cartman
Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company "Washington Redskins," it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. [grins, knowing that's not the reason.]
Dan Snyder
Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?
Cartman
Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. [the men, dejected, turn and walk out the door]
A Redskins jet in the sky. Snyder sits alone in it
Flight attendant
All around the world, people are saying they are inspired by the Washington Redskins. The Internet startup company has raised so much money in Kickstarter that now, more groups are doing the same.
Reporter
[a reporter speaks as Snyder looks over hit masses pool] More news on the Washington Redskins tonight. Their defiant. F-You attitude has now caught the attention of the terrorist group ISIS. The terrorists said they admire the Washington Redskins and want to try it and follow their business model.
A caller
[a newspaper falls out of a car, and Snyder picks it up and reads it] Well, let's not forget, Marsha that there's a people here, okay, who are not happy about the use of the name, the Football Washington Redskins!
Woman
Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? [he turns to the camera and sheds a tear, in the manner of Indian Eyes Cody (Espera Oscar de Corti)]
Back at Washington Redskins headquarters...
Cartman
Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
Kyle
[enters with Stan] Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
Cartman
Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
Kyle
People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
Cartman
Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about! [pounds the desk a couple of times.] Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are! [pound] Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
Kyle
That's the Catholic Church!
Cartman
NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
Kyle
That's the NFL!
Cartman
It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
Butters
[gasps] Oh no!
Kyle
All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
Cartman
Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
Kyle
Maybe I'll start my own company.
Cartman
Well that's fine! You can't call yourself "Washington Redskins!"
Kyle
I don't want to! It's a stupid name! [eerie music plays for a few seconds]
Cartman
Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
Kyle
Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
Cartman
Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
Stan
I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
Cartman
Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. [Kyle and Stan walk out the door. Butters begins to follow them, but stops in his tracks.]
Butters
Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
NFL Headquarters
Dan Snyder
Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?!
Goodell
[sound clips come out of his mouth, indicating he's a robot] I will get it right, and do whatever is necessary to accomplish that.
Dan Snyder
What?!
Goodell
We will continue to identify and add expertise to our team.
Dan Snyder
That's the most ridiculous nothing answer I've ever heard! What are you gonna do now?!
Goodell
Everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month.
Dan Snyder
Ugh! This thing is broken!
Goodell
We can add... and we will do more, do more, do more [winds down and continues in a high pitch]
Dan Snyder
Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again!
Skype session
Dan Snyder
And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this!
Jim Irsay
Dan, you don't wanna be dealin' with this stuff. Let the Goodell-bot do it.
Dan Snyder
The stupid thing isn't working!
Goodell
[starts up again] I will get it right.
Steve Bischiotti
Man, that thing hasn't worked right since we bought it.
Dan Snyder
Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name.
Paul Allen
Did you tell them we're about honor and integrity?
Alex Spanos
If the Goodell bot is broken, we must stay out of it more than even usual!
Dan Snyder
And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart?
Jerry Jones
My eyes aren't too far apart!
Paul Allen
If we get them to change their logo, will it make you happy?
Dan Snyder
Uh I guess we can live with that.
Jim Irsay
Then it is decided! We will make them change their logo. Begin mas behind-the-scenes under-the-table enforcement of our wishes NOW
Owners
Go! [all screens go blank]
Dan Snyder
Thank God!
A Washington Redskins announcement. Lots of cheering and applause. Cartman steps on stage before a giant Redskins logo
Cartman
Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! "Fuck you." Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with. [An image of the office appears, with the new changes] To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting. [a pair of tits and male genitalia are added to the original logo, to much cheer and applause] Now when people hear the name "Redskins", they will immediately think "titties" and "balls". It's just a bold new way that we can say "We don't fucking care." Go Redskins! [cheering and applause]
Kyle's room. He and Stan are discussing their new company - it's "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC." resurrected
Kyle
It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
Stan
Yeah...
Kyle
You okay, bro?
Stan
I just... never saw myself owning a company called "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC."
Kyle
Give it time, it'll grow on you.
Stan
Why don't we just call it "Untitled Startup Company"?
Kyle
Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
Stan
Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
Kyle
Well whattaya mean?
Stan
I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
Kyle
Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that "Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table" is holding you back. [Stan slowly walks to the door, then turns around]
Stan
Good luck with your company, dude.
Kyle
Yeah. Good luck with yours. [Stan leaves and closes the door]
Kickstarter Headquarters, night.
Employee
It's just... incredible, Harry. Everyone is using Kickstarter for everything!
Harry
And for every project funded, we get 5%.

It's like, we don't even have to do anything and we just make money.
Harry
Sitting on our asses, here we come.
Kickstarter, moments later. Tribal music comes up. Dan Snyder rises from the bushes
Dan Snyder
Caw-CAW, Caw-CAW. [his football team rises from the bushes and gather behind him] HooHOO, hoohooHOO. [other players appear and they all move in. A player sneaks past a Kickstarter employee]
Employee 2
[lowers his cup] Huh? [goes back to sipping coffee. Two more players sneak past him, and #88 tackles him moments later. Number 28 tackles another employee. Pretty soon all the employees are targeted. Two players make it to the servers and head-butt them, causing damage to them. Number 48 kicks the head off one of the employees. An uninjured female waits for an elevator. The doors open, she goes in, and number 28 spooks her. She screams. Later, Kickstarter is in flames]
South Park, morning
Cartman
Goooood morning, guys!
Butters
Happy Deadline Day!
Cartman
We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
Butters
Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!
Cartman
[tries to visit his page, but it's not coming up] What the hell? Can't find the server? [tries again] Kickstarter.com! [not found] Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
Butters
It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
Kenny
(What?!)
Butters
Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
Cartman
What?!
Butters
Somebody killed Kickstarter!
Cartman
Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?! [gasps] Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
Kyle's room. He's having trouble accessing the site too.
Kyle
What the hell is wrong? "Can't find the server" Kickstarter. [Cartman barges in with Butters and Kenny in tow]
Cartman
You song of a bitch!
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
You broke Kickstarter!
Kyle
No, I just can't get it to load.
Cartman
Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
Kyle
My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
Cartman
Well, somebody did!
Stan
It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here. [walks up to the boys] Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
Kyle
He's right. We should do a merger.
Cartman
[shocked] A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! [begins walking out the door]
Kyle
Yes we do! We have a sweet name. [Cartman turns around] I was wrong, Cartman. "Washington Redskins" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
Cartman
[steps forward] It is really sweet.
Stan
And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
Butters
Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
Kyle
Whattaya say, Cartman?
Third Redskins announcement. Cartman comes out on stage again to cheers and applause
Cartman
Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks! [the cheering and applause die down] How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
Kyle
[joins Cartman onstage] When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself. [The modified Redskin logo fades to a single line saying "GO FUND YOURSELF"] And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
Cartman
You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest "fuck you" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. [The neo logo comes up - it's two of the old logo, with titties and balls and penises, one taking the other from behind. This receives cheers and applause]
Cartman and Kyle
Go Redskins!
Arlington Stadium. A helicopter shot of the stadium
Announcer
A beautiful night in Arlington, Texas as the Dallas Cowboys get set to take on the Washington Redskins. That is, of course, Washington Redskins the football team, not Washington Redskins, the audacious crowd-funding company.
Commentator
Yeah, and if you ask me, the Redskins are a scam.
Announcer
You're talking about the crowd-funding company- Redskins, right?
Commentator
That's right. An-and now you've got terrorist groups like ISIS using the Redskins to raise their money. I-I don't like what the Redskins are doing.
Announcer
Those Redskins
Commentator
Yeah, whatever.
The Visitors locker room. The Redskins sit there looking morose, even their owner Dan Snyder. Somber Native American music play
#35
It's over. Our name has been reduced to a stereotype and a joke.
#59
Yeah, let's just go home.
Dan Snyder
No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points.
#92
Yeah, but I just feel pretty stupid wearing this now.
#72
Yeah.
#35
Come on, guys.
#8
Where will we go? What will we do? [and with that his players desert him]
Dan Snyder
Don't let them break you! Don't let them win! [as kickoff approaches, a Native American drumbeat starts up]
Announcer
And the Cowboys are still set to kick off, but there doesn't seem to be anyone to kick off to.
Commentator
Yeah, and Jerry Jones must be happy this means a forfeit, another win for the Cowboys. [with his bright chameleon eyes and a woman popping up from between his legs, he must indeed be happy. Mellow Native American music joins the drumbeat]
Announcer
Wait a minute, it appears a lone Redskin is making his way out of the locker room. [Dan Snyder comes out, not in uniform, but willing to face down the Cowboys. The referee blows the whistle and the game starts.] The Cowboys kick it off. [Snyder catches it, but the Cowboys quickly pile up on him, then get off]
Dan Snyder
[dusts himself off] Hut! Hut Hut Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. He dusts himself off] Hut hut hut. Hut Hut Hut Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. He dusts himself off. He's quite beat up now] Hut. Hut hut hut. Hut Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. The crowd finally reacts]
Crowd
Oh!
Fan wearing #3
Just stay down! For the love of God!
Dan Snyder
[barely able to move] Hut hut. Hut! [the Cowboys pile up on him again, then get off. He dusts himself off]
Fan wearing #74
Stop! Make it stop!
Fan wearing #82
Just stay down!
Another fan
Please!
Fan wearing a blue star
Just make him stay down!
Other fans
Go Redskins! Go Redskins!
Washington Redskins, now a crowd-funding company. Stan is at the armchair sipping Coke, Cartman is kicking back on the couch, Butters is at the desk working a paddleball, Kyle reads from a book, and Kenny is on a tablet
Stan
Boy, this is the life, huh guys?
Butters
We finally did it!
Cartman
I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. [a brick flies in through a window and shards flow into the room]
Kyle
What the heck is that? [the boys leave the building to investigate]
Outside headquarters, they face a protest
Cartman
Whoa, whoa! What?
Protestor #1
Change your name!
Protestor #2
It doesn't belong in today's society!
Kyle
Change our name?
Stan
But you all thought our name was sweet.
Protestor #3
There's nothing sweet about a people who were decimated. A once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by Cowboys in a defiant last stand!
Kyle
When was that?
Protestor #4
Last night.
Protestor #5
Until you change your name, we are asking all your subscribers to boycott you.
ISIS Spokesman
That's right! ISIS will no longer use your insensitive company for its fundraising!
Crowd
Yeah! Alright!
Protestor #1
Good for you, ISIS!
Kyle
Well what the hell do we do?
Cartman
[sighs and his voice drops] I guess we gotta go back to school. [they boys turn left and walk away, their heads hanging down. The protesters keep cheering until they're gone.]
End of Go Fund Yourself

Gluten Free Ebola
South Park Elementary, day. The boys are indeed back at school, their crowdfunding venture having fizzled on the fires of an offensive trademark. Students head to their classrooms. The main four come in looking bright and ready to go
Kyle
Hey guys!
Stan
Morning!
Cartman
How's it going, everybody?
Kyle
Sup, Jason? [Jason turns and walks away angrily]
Cartman
Hey dude. Sup? [they encounter Token, Craig, and Jimmy.]
Craig
What are you guys doing here?
Cartman
What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
Jimmy
I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
Token
Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.
Kyle
Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
Craig
But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
Cartman
Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
Craig
[keeps pressing] You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.
Kyle
We were- trying to be funny.
Jimmy
Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle. [Token, Craig and Jimmy split up, then everyone else goes their separate ways. Moments later, Wendy is shown at her locker]
Stan
[walks up] Hey Wendy.
Wendy
You're... back?
Stan
Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
Wendy
[sarcastic] Oh wow, I'm shocked.
Stan
So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
Wendy
You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be "free to chase your dreams".
Stan
Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
Wendy
Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be [does air quotes] "dripping in bitches"?!
Stan
Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? [Wendy closes her locker and faces him]
Wendy
I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! [turns around and walks away]
The cafeteria, lunchtime. Cartman looks around
Cartman
Dude, people are pissed off at us.
Kenny
(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)
Kyle
Doesn't anyone understand the significance of "I'm sorry" anymore?
Cartman
Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
Kyle
Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
Faculty room
Pricipal Victoria
All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start?
Woman
Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
Mr. Adler
Awww, do we need Mackey here?
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.
Principal Victoria
Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.
Mr. Adler
He doesn't look any different to me.
Principal Victoria
In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?
Mr. Garrison
It's just the new diet fad! [a door opens]
Mr. Mackey
Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?
Principal Victoria
Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.
Mr. Mackey
I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
Mr. Garrison
[exasperated, face in his hands] Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?
Principal Victoria
Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.
Mr. Mackey
That's probably gluten, m'kay?
Coach
Oh, God!
Mr. Mackey
Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,
Mr. Garrison
I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
Mr. Mackey
See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off.
Principal Victoria
[surprized and interested] Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.
The school gym, day. Gutted by the fire, but not condemned. The fourth graders are inside during their PE period. The girls jump rope, the boys try to make baskets through a badly damaged hoop. Other boys toss basketballs at each other, while Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit on the burnt bleachers.
Kyle
I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
Kenny
(Right. What the fuck is going on?)
Cartman
You know what we gotta do, guys? [gets off the bleachers] We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
Kenny
(A party?!)
Cartman
Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
Kyle
Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
Cartman
Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
Kyle
[joins him on the floor] Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
Cartman
Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
Stan
[joins them on the floor] For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
Cartman
What?
Kyle
No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
Cartman
We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
Kyle
A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
Stan
Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
Cartman
Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
Kenny
(This will be awesome!)
Cartman
So who do we throw the party for?
Stan
What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. [Pink's "Get This Party Started" begins to play, which serves as transitional music to the next scene]
WSPIC 88.3, on air. The Camera pans down to the DJ
DJ
All right, that was "Get This Party Started" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?
Kyle
Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
Cartman
You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
DJ
Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?
Cartman
You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
Stan
Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
DJ
Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel?
Scott
I actually have plans this weekend.
Cartman
"I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes."
DJ
All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question?
Craig
Are you guys making this up?
Kyle
Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
Craig
All the pizza we can eat?
Cartman
Believe it, dude.
Craig
All right, this better be good.
DJ
All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy!
Stan
Sweet!
DJ
Next caller, what's your question?
Principal Victoria
Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?
Stan
Excuse me?
Principal Victoria
Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.
DJ
Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?
Mark
Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"
DJ
All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.
Cartman
What the hell is gluten?
Park County community center, night. Most everyone in town is at the meeting tonight.
John Garner
Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight.
Randy
[To Gerald] Make your dick fly off?
John Garner
People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say "Well there's fat in butter too," but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?
Mr. Garrison
Yes, thank you!
John Garner
Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. [holds up a stalk of wheat]. Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough. [grabs a wad of dough] Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy. [puts the dough into a special washer. The extract going through a distillation process] Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein.
Mr. Mackey
Then eat it!
John Garner
Excuse me?
Mr. Mackey
If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?
John Garner
[looks at the gluten, then at the audience, then moves the gluten to his lips] Yeah. Alright. [sips it down] Dup, dup. [his body contorts as he groans. Everyone in the audience begins to panic. He shows signs of burning up, and his groin begins to set off electrical sparks. His penis wriggles out of there and soon launches itself.]
Mr. Mackey
Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. [people begin to leave the community center. The penis escapes and comes back to knock a man down]
Papa John's Pizza is shown. The townsfolk run right past it.
Stephen
[stops] Oh my God! These people don't even know! [faces the pizza joint] Hurry! You gotta go!
Mr. Garrison
[stops as well] Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there! [inside, two workers just stand around behind the counter] Get out of there!
Stephen
Get out! You're not safe!
Mr. Garrison
You gotta get out!
Stephen
Hurry! You gotta go!
The Marsh kitchen. Randy opens the cupboard and pulls everything out of it. Sharon does the same at another cupboard. They're both in a panic. Shelly and Stan appear at the kitchen entrance
Randy
What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
Sharon
Yes!
Randy
Hamburger Helper?
Sharon
That's all gluten!
Randy
There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!
Sharon
Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.
Randy
Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!
Sharon
It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!
Stan
Wait, wait, ah I might need those.
Randy
This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
Sharon
Don't forget the freezer!
Randy
Oh God! [now clearing the freezer] Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
Sharon
I don't know! Look at the ingredients!
Randy
Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
Sharon
All right, that's all of it!
Randy
You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
Sharon
I can get both of these, yeah!
Randy
All right, come on! [a loaf of whole wheat sandwich bread falls out. Moments later, Randy comes back for it, then leaves again]
Kyle's room, night. Kyle is working on the party's budget when his phone rings. It's Cartman
Kyle
Hey Cartman.
Cartman
KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
Kyle
Dude, calm down.
Cartman
THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
Kyle
Who took all the pizza and the cake? [begins to notice flickering lights outside his window and hears an approaching crowd. All the gluten-tainted food that people have been bagging is being thrown into a bonfire] What the hell?
Cartman
KYYYLE!
A wheat field outside of town. Rolling hills of wheat are shown when the start turning brown. A flamethrower begins burning the field. A man wielding the flamethrower appears walking methodically through the field
Mr. Garrison
Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!
Farmer
What are you doing to my farm?!?
Randy
You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! [knocks him down with a right punch to the right cheek]
U.S.D.A. Strategic Command Center, FDA approved, day.
Tom Vilsack
There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!
Researcher
We're working as fast as we can, sir.
Tom Vilsack
[sighs loudly] Are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction?
Researcher
[they stop by a rat cage] We gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago. You can see it already having a negative effect. [the rat is having an arousal it can't control. It flips over on its back and its penis wriggles out, and shoots off. The rat dies.]
Tom Vilsack
We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?
Researcher
No. We believe now that that's poppycock.
Tom Vilsack
[to everyone on the floor] All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis! [turns left and leaves. Another rat in the background loses its penis and dies.]
Cartman's room. Cartman is in bed with a slight cough. He blows his nose, and his door opens. the boys enter
Kyle
Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
Cartman
What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
Stan
We can't let our party suck.
Cartman
What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
Kyle
That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
Stan
[looks down, then] I'll be back. [turns and leaves]
Cartman
You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
Kyle
Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
Cartman
[turns to his right side] There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
The Marsh house. The bell rings and Randy answers it.
Randy
Yes?
Worker 1
Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?
Randy
Gluten expohn... oh not here!
Worker 2
Can we come in please?
Randy
Wuh sure! [shows them in. They enter and their gluten meters crackle as they go around the house]
Sharon
[coming down the stairs] What's going on? [one of the workers stops at the kitchen wastebasket and pulls out a pair of tongs. He rifles through the trash can with it and pulls out a Pabst Blue Ribbon can]
Randy
Well that's just a beer.
Worker 1
Oh Jesus.
Shelly
BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!
Randy
[to Shelly] Shuut up, [to the worker] beer is bad for you?!
Worker 2
We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me.
Randy
Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
Worker 1
We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.
Randy
No! Not Papa John's. [shakes his head] I don't wanna go to Papa John's! [shakes his head more violently] YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
Papa John's, day. It is now Gluten Quarantine Center 1, and Randy's the newest quarantine. Outside are one of the workers and a soldier
Randy
How long do I have to stay here?!
Soldier
Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir.
Randy
What am I supposed to eat?
Soldier
It's okay, there's lots of toppings. Just eat the toppings. [the soldier and the worker walk away]
A Quarantine
How'd you get exposed? [it's a blond man on the floor] Bagels? Gravy?
Randy
Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
Mr. Garrison
There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce. [his voice grows soft] Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.
USDA headquarters, day
Jeff
We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain.
Tom Vilsack
And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves?
Researcher
[approaches with an open laptop] We've been running simulations, but they're problematic because they don't relate to our current schematics. Here, look. This is what we've been recommending for the past three years. [Shown is a food tray with dish and cup on it. The dish has larger portions for veggies and grains, smaller portions for fruits and proteins, and the cup is dairy, off to the side with the smallest portion] Five basic food groups, not four. We were wrong about that. We now realize, of course, that the largest of these groups we've been recommending is basically poison [a skull and crossbones appears over the grains]. Sir, to combat the gluten, we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups, but so far, no answers.
Agent
Sir, the feds are here.
Tom Vilsack
Oh shit!
FDA Agent 1
Tom Vilsack?
Tom Vilsack
Yes?
Michael Taylor
Michael Taylor, FDA.
Tom Vilsack
Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem.
Michael Taylor
Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too!
Papa John's, day. Stan approaches the blocked entrance
Stan
Dad? Dad!
Randy
[appears through a window] Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
Stan
Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
Randy
I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
Stan
Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
Randy
How's your mom? Your, your sister?
Soldier 2
[appears next to him and begins tugging at him] This is a quarantined area, kid. You're you're gonna have to go.
Stan
Nonono, not yet. DAD!
Randy
That's my son, you bastard!
Soldier 2
I'm sorry, all right?
Stan
Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
Randy
Staaan!
Stan
Let me talk to my dad! [the soldier finally hauls him away]
Randy
Staaaaaaan!
Cartman's room, night. He's asleep. A nightmare comes on, and visions of fellow students pass through his dream
Craig
You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
Token
Come on guys, let's go!
Jimmy
No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! [the voices mount and soon he's lifted out of bed as one last kid says "What a loser" which echoes and fades away. He finds himself in bayou territory]
Aunt Jemima
Hello, Eric. [he sees her, on a porch, with a plate of pancakes] Come on over here, sugar.
Cartman
Aunt Jemima. [stands up and walks over]
Aunt Jemima
There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way.
Cartman
I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
Aunt Jemima
You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign.
Cartman
I don't even know what that means.
Aunt Jemima
When you're stuck, look to the pyramids.
Cartman
Are you going to eat those pancakes?
Aunt Jemima
They've got it wrong, child! [suddenly the scenery changes to the pyramids at Giza. Her voice takes on a cosmic tone, and Cartman spins in place] The world is upside down.
Cartman
Oooo, trippy...
Aunt Jemima
Tell then they've got's it backwards!
Cartman
They've got what backward? [everything vanishes into a gray field, then a golden triangle appears, then shatters. A kaleidoscope of kids appears, taunting him. Aunt Jemima's face shatters, revealing the golden triangle.]
Cartman
[he falls through his dream, surrounded by everything that has gluten in it] Noooo... [and suddenly wakes up] Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.
Papa John's, day. establishing shot. Inside Randy sits on a cot
Randy
You can't just keep us in here!
Mr. Garrison
[clanging] We're out. [holds up an empty tray] We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.
Blond
[looks outside, then] They're just gonna let us starve to death?
Randy
They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. [buries his face in his hands]
Blond
Well then, I guess I might as well eat! [stands up and walks towards the storage room]
Mr. Garrison
There's nothing left, I told you.
Blond
There's plenty of pizza dough.
Randy
Are you crazy?
Blond
I'm crazy hungry! [takes a wad of dough and begins eating it] Oh... Oh... Fuck it's so good. [Randy and Mr. Garrison wait for the other shoe to drop] I want more! ...it's been so long! [gets more dough and eats voraciously]
Randy
Oh my God, you... [the blond stops] but... you're okay.
Blond
You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man!
Mr. Garrison
A setup? But by who?
Randy
Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.
Blond
Maybe Papa John can help us. If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can- [his penis quickly flies off and he dies]
Randy
Ng-oh. [snaps his fingers. He and Garrison go find seats]
WSPIC 88.3, on air. Stan is reading an announcement
Stan
There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
DJ
Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller.
Craig
I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
Kyle
We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
Craig
Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?
DJ
All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead.
Jamie
It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves!
DJ
Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air.
Wendy
Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?
Stan
I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
Wendy
So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
Scott
That is correct, yes, I do.
Wendy
You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?
Kyle
Jesus Christ, dude.
Stan
Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
Wendy
Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!
Stan
We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
Wendy
Thought so. [hangs up. Stan lets his head fall on the table]
DJ
Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?
Cartman
KYYYLE!
Kyle
Cartman?
Cartman
KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
USDA headquarters, day. Everyone is in a rush.
Tom Vilsack
It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die!
Jeff White
Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something.
Tom Vilsack
Who is this?
Cartman
My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
Tom Vilsack
The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure? [to the floor] Bring up the pyramid! [a programmer gets on it. An image comes up on screen, showing four food groups in four layers inside a pyramid. Grains take the bottom, widest layer, followed by fruits and vegetables, meat and dairy, and fats and oils narrowing to a point at the top]
Cartman
What, what is it? What is it for?
Tom Vilsack
We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups.
Programmer
Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved.
Tom Vilsack
The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.
Cartman
It's upside down.
Tom Vilsack
What?
Cartman
Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
Tom Vilsack
Turn the pyramid upside down.
Programmer 2
You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the-
Tom Vilsack
Flip the damned food pyramid!
Michael Taylor
This is NOT FDA-approved!
Tom Vilsack
It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT! [the programmers get on it]
Programmer 3
Sir, we've got a match.
Programmer 4
Nutrition is stabilizing!
Programmer 5
We've got a well-balanced vaccine, sir! [everyone cheers]
Tom Vilsack
Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter.
The awesome party, day. The boys came through, everyone in town is there. Mr. Garrison serves steaks with large bars of butter to Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria. "We love you Scott." Photo booth, soda station
Craig
[with butter on a stick] Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.
Kyle
Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
Scott
[approaches with a plate of butter on a stick] Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
Kyle
We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. [Scott walks away]
Tom Vilsack
We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again.
Cartman
Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
Tom Vilsack
We're gonna get a better view of the stage.
Cartman
Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. [takes a couple of steps and notices the ghost of Aunt Jemima over a fence. He waves at her. She waves back.]
Jeff White
Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde!
Clyde
I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
Jimmy
Yeah, she isn't as hot in person.
Randy
[dressed up as Lorde]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.

Stan
Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?
Wendy
Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.
Stan
Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
Wendy
You're so transparent, Stan.
Stan
What does that mean?
Wendy
You wanna dance? [he looks back at her, smiles, and goes to dance with her.]
Randy
We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.

End of Gluten Free Ebola


The bus stop, morning. The boys wait for the bus, but Cartman seems particularly steamed today. His right hand is in his jacket pocket, and angry music plays
Cartman
[thinking] Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago. [looks down at Stan's feet, than at Kyle's] Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all. [Stan notices and looks. Cartman notices Stan and shoves his hand further into his pocket. Stan looks at Cartman and steps away from him.] I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! [Kyle notices Cartman's anger]
Kyle
Are you okay, Cartman?
Cartman
[brightens up] Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle? [settles into angry funk again and thinks] They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time. [Kyle and Kenny look at each other, then they look at Cartman] We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
South Park Elementary, a couple hours later. Cartman heads for the boys room and enters. He has some magazines with him
Butters
[at the urinal, pants down] Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
Cartman
Good for you. [tries to get into the first stall, but finds it locked]
Butters
[looks over] I think someone's in there.
Cartman
No! God damn it no! [pounds on the door] Who's takin' a shit?!
Craig
Occupied.
Cartman
I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
Craig
You can't call dibs on a toilet.
Cartman
Son of a bitch! [moves on to Stall 2, tries to open it, and finds it locked too.] Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
Kyle
Then don't eat 14 Eggo waffles for lunch, fatass!
Cartman
ALL RIGHT THAT DOES IT! [turns around and walks toward the door]I'M SICK OF THIS SHIT AND I'M NOT [throws his magazines to the floor] GONNA BE TAKING IT ANY LONGER! [reaches into his jacket pocket] You all pushed me to this! [pulls out a pink bow and plops it on to his hat, then continues out the door. Butters just looks on. Cartman leaves the boys room and enters the girls room. Wendy and Bebe are at the mirror. Wendy is quick to notice, and then faces him. Cartman heads for a stall and Wendy block him]
Wendy
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Cartman
I'm going to the potty.
Wendy
This is the girls bathroom!
Cartman
Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
Wendy
WHAT?!
Cartman
Did you notice the bow? [points to it] I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit. [barges into Stall 1, locks it, drops his pants, and sits down. Wendy shrugs with her palms up. The first poop falls and Wendy and Bebe recoil] Aaahhh!
Wendy
GET OUT OF HERE!
Cartman
Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy! [drops another deuce] Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. [groans to get another deuce out, followed by a fart. Red comes out of Stall 2]
Red
What the hell is that?!
Wendy
Cartman is using our bathroom!
Cartman
Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
Red
Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!
Cartman
It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. [farts and poops some more]
Principal's office, moments later
Principal Victoria
I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
Cartman
Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girl's shitter.
Principal Victoria
You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!
Cartman
Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
Principal Victoria
All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!
Cartman
That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
Principal Victoria
Alright, listen Eric!
Cartman
Erica.
Principal Victoria
Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
Cartman
All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
Principal Victoria
With the what?!
Faculty room, later. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey sit at the table as Mr. Garrison looks outside
Mr. Garrison
Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.
Mr. Mackey
But then cisgender-ed is just normal
Mr. Garrison
[faces Mackey and Victoria] Saying "normal" is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group. [gets emphatic] Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girl's room!
Principal Victoria
But this isn't a hurt and confused child we're talking about. This is Eric Cartman.
Mr. Garrison
Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.
Principal Victoria
Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?
Mr. Garrison
Actually, [turns around and looks outside again] it's more like a royal flush.
The Broflovski house, day. A reporter stops by and rings the doorbell. Gerald opens the door
Reporter
Gerald Broflovski?
Gerald
Yes?
Brandon Carlile
Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I was hoping you could help me... make sense of somethin'. I understand you had a very large party in your back yard last... last Sunday, was it?
Gerald
That's right. [Sheila appears in the background] My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
Brandon Carlile
I also understand that a very famous pop artist, Lorde, was the entertainment at that party.
Gerald
Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.
Brandon Carlile
Well it, eh, it's just a little curious, you know? Why a hugely popular Top-20 artist would play such a... well no offence, but such a humble venue?
Gerald
...Sorry, I don't think I get your-
Brandon Carlile
You understand, we deal with a lot of fake stories at Spin. [glances at his pen] Was just wondering how the boys got someone like Lorde to play.
Gerald
From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.
Brandon Carlile
You wouldn't know who?
Gerald
No. Does it really matter?
Brandon Carlile
[slow zoom] Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady. It would be a shame if someone was... having fun at her expense.
The Marsh laundry room. Sharon is sorting clothes. She sees that Steamy Ray Vaughn is still around, from the brown streaks in Randy's briefs. She pulls out the briefs from two pairs of Randy's pants, but is intrigued when she looks into the third pair. She pulls out... some fishnet stockings and her eyes open wide.
The living room, moments later. Randy's on the couch sipping on Pabst Blue Ribbon.
Sharon
[walks up with the stockings] Randy? Whose are these?
Randy
[sits up] Aaah I don't know. Why?
Sharon
Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
Randy
In my jeans?
Sharon
Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
Randy
[gives in] ...Yeah. I do.
Girls room, recess, next day. Wendy, Bebe, Red, and a new girl stand with their jackets over their noses, the smell is so bad. Cartman is in there again. The girl looks like the singer Sia, so we'll go with that.
Red
[bangs on the wall on one side of stall 1] Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes!
Sia
Yeah! Recess is almost over!
Cartman
There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
Sia
Not while you're in here!
Cartman
Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
Wendy
Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
Cartman
Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what? [drops a deuce] That's what. [laughs his ass off. Principal Victoria walks in behind the girls] Suck my clit and balls.
Principal Victoria
Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.
Cartman
I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. [poops and farts]
Principal Victoria
If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! [Cartman farts one last time, cleans up, and leaves the stall]
Cartman
Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
Principal Victoria
Would that be agreeable to you?
Cartman
OH MY GOD!!!
Wendy
That isn't fair!
Red
Wendy, just go with it!
Cartman
Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
The janitor's closet. Cartman plans out his new restroom with an interior designer
Cartman
Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
Designer
Uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side?
Cartman
Oh on that side?
Designer
You know, because you've already got AC over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall.
Cartman
Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
The Marsh house, night. Randy enters his garage, pulls out his phone, and taps in a number. Someone picks up
Randy
Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
Record Executive
[in his chair at his desk, facing away from the camera] I know your wife means a lot to you, Randy, [turns around in his chair] but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us.
Randy
You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
Record Executive
How many times have you said "I think I've lost it" and everything turned out to be okay?
Randy
Every time?
Record Executive
Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me.
Randy
Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup. [hangs up. He walks up to a poster and moves it to one side, revealing a hole in the wall with stacks of bills inside. He pulls out some more bills from his back pocket and adds them to the stacks]
The Record Executive's office. A young man walks in. The executive looks out the window
Ron
You wanted to see me?
Record Executive
Sit down, Ron. [Ron sits] Whattaya know about one of our artists, Lorde?
Ron
[shrugs] Seventeen-year-old girl from New Zealand, great songwriter, [shrugs] humble.
Record Executive
Wrong. [turns to face him] She's a 45-year-old man in Colorado.
Ron
What?
Record Executive
He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference.
Ron
Huh. [the realization sinks in] Holy shit.
Record Executive
He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do.
The Marsh house, master bedroom. Randy's at the foot of the bed with guitar in hand and some lyrics on the bed
Randy
Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.

Sharon
[appears at the bedroom door] Randy?
Randy
[drops the guitar and gathers up his sheets] I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. [chuckles]
Sharon
I was. Can you help me unload the car? [turns left and walks away]
Randy
Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.

Sharon
[comes back and peeks inside] Randy?
Randy
[loses his sheets] Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming. [follows her to the car]
South Park Elementary, day. A new restroom, Other, replaces the janitor's closet. A workman drills in the final screws for the OTHER sign. Butters and Craig observe him, Craig and Token walk up. The workman finishes up as Stan arrives
Stan
What is that?
Butters
That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
Stan
Cartman's a girl now?
Butters
He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. [turns around and walks away.]
Cartman
[rushes up] It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go. [opens the door, looks inside and grins. Inside is one of the fanciest restrooms one will ever see. Icicle lights all around, waterfall to the left, fancy commode to the right, plush towels and toilet seat cover. Triumphant music plays] Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome. [closes and locks the door] Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good! [claps twice - he's got the Clapper feature in there. The lights dim and Vivaldi's Spring begins to play] Perfect. [reaches over for a cat-o-five-tails and begins whipping the toilet with it] Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide. [the kids nearby just stand there shocked] You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready! [remembers there are people outside] Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!
Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails, night. Nelson is at the bar. Brandon Carlile appears nearby
Brandon Carlile
Peter Nelson?
Nelson
Yes?
Brandon Carlile
[pulls up a stool next to him] Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I understand you work at the U.S. Geological Survey?
Nelson
Yeah, that's right.
Brandon Carlile
I also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter, Lorde?
Nelson
[sighs] Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?
Brandon Carlile
Work with her? How? [they move to a booth for some privacy]
Nelson
I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.
Brandon Carlile
How's that?
Nelson
Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.
Brandon Carlile
The what?
Nelson
She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch. [Brandon tries to figure out what to write, but draws a blank]
South Park Elementary. Cartman walks down the hallway singing to himself
Clyde
Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.
Cartman
Yup! You know what Hillary says: "You can suck my clit and balls." [goes into his bathroom]
Red
[talking to Bebe nearby] Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I-
Wendy
Hey guys. [all look and stare. Wendy walks down the hallway dressed as her male persona, Wendyl, in t-shirt and vest, purple pants, hair pinned back.]
Red
...Wendy?
Wendy
How's it hanging'?
Craig
Whoa..
Jenny
Huh?
Jason
Whoa, wait, is that?
Butters
Holy moly! [Wendy pulls out a key and goes into the Other bathroom]
Cartman
Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
Wendy
It's cool. I'll wait.
Cartman
DUDE, THIS IS MY FUCKING BATHROOM!
Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Wendy and Cartman are present
Cartman
I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
Principal Victoria
I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
Cartman
Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
Principal Victoria
You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?
Cartman
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT A CHICK WATCHING ME GO POO!
Principal Victoria
I thought you were a chick.
Cartman
NO! I IDENTIFY AS A CHICK, BUT I'M STILL A BOY. YOU CAN'T MAKE ME SHARE A BATHROOM WITH A GIRL THAT IDENTIFIES HERSELF AS A FUCKING DUDE! [thinks for a few seconds] That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
South Park Elementary, later. Stan is at his locker
Cartman
[runs up to Stan] Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
Stan
[surprised] What?
Cartman
Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?! [Stan looks around] Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! STAN-AN'S A GIR-RL! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! [walks away]
Shelly's room, evening. Randy knocks at her door
Randy
Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.
Shelly
Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!
Randy
You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
Shelly
[sits up] Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!
Randy
[sees a poster of himself as Lorde] Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. [walks away saddened]
The Marsh garage, moments later. Randy is adding more stacks to the stacks of bills he's hidden behind the poster. A door opens and Randy quickly seals up the hole. He gets to his workbench just as Stan closes the door.
Stan
Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
Randy
Oh really? A-About... about what?
Stan
Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside? [Randy sighs deeply and stands up to walk] I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
Randy
Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.
Stan
...What?
Randy
It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
Stan
Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
Randy
Yah, that's my cover.
Stan
The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
Randy
Yeah. [turns around and faces Stan] The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go "Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games." But they just- do what they want with my songs.
Stan
Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
Randy
Autotune. Wanna see how I do it? [moments later, a music program pops up. Twelve tracks are shown at lower left] I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone. [plays the highlighted track]
"Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn" [farts and poop noises] "Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter."

Stan
Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.
Randy
Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops. [replays the same track with drum loops added] Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything. [brings up the quantizer and chooses his settings] Backup instruments. [scale, beats, bass, tambourine, guitars, strings] And then finally I use the Autotune. ["Auto-Tuner v10." He chooses his settings there, and the song is transformed. The same track is now enhanced with Sia's voice and no trace of Randy]
"Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter."

[this is all too much for Stan to take in, and he passes out. Randy notices] Stan?
South Park Elementary, next day. Stan is in the hallway looking at the restrooms, weighing his options
Butters
[walks past Stan, then stops] Hey! Everything okay, Stan?
Stan
...I don't know where I belong...
Butters
Just hold it. That's what I do now. [continues on his way. Stan walks towards the girls room, but veers left to look at the boys room. Then he spins round and walks to the Other room, whips out his key for it, and goes in.]
Cartman
HEY, WHAT THE FUCK DUDE?! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT!
Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Stan and Cartman are present
Cartman
Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
Principal Victoria
Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?
Stan
I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
Cartman
He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
U.S. Geological Survey, Colorado, day. Quite the busy office space. At the boss's office, someone knocks and opens his door
Randy
[in his Lorde attire.] You wanted to see me, boss?
Boss
Yes. Please have a seat, Lorde.
Randy
[closes the door and sits next to a woman] Hi Carol.
Carol
[avoiding eye contact] Lorde.
Boss
Lorde, we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off.
Randy
Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
Boss
Amazing, yeah. Uh... Lorde... for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to... uh... find your own space... to go to the bathroom. [a few seconds of silence] Everyone loves you, but we thought it would be great if you had your very own executive bathroom. [whips out an executive key]
Randy
I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
Carol
My girls are big fans of your music, Lorde, but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with [stops herself immediately]
Randy
With what? [moments of awkward glances follow] With what? [getting no answer, he gets up and leaves.]
E! breaking news
Announcer
You are watching E! Entertainment News! That's how low you've sunk.
Anchor
It's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer Lorde. The singer went dark on Twitter claiming severe depression, and stating [the statement goes up on screen] "I realize now that I make people uncomfortable. I need to give this up and go back to just being the old me." Spin Magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit, and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week.
South Park Elementary, day. Stan walks down the crowded hall when he's stopped by Cartman
Cartman
Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
Butters
Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
Cartman
At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?! [the other kids agree, but not strongly] What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
Butters
Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
Clyde
[steps forward] Awe, come on, lay off him guys.
Cartman
Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
Clyde
No, no, just he is. [retreats and walks away]
The Marsh house, day, backyard. Randy sits at a picnic table alone with his thoughts and a beer. Sharon walks out
Sharon
You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
Randy
[Raises up his Pabst to show Sharon] It's okay, it's gluten free.
Sharon
All right. [turns around and goes back towards the house, but stops and looks back] Do you know why young people like Lorde so much. [Randy sits up and looks over his shoulder] It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. [goes back inside the house and closes the sliding door]
"Lorde"
[Randy's finished song, "Feelin' Good On A Wednesday / Push"]
Feelin' good on a Wednesday

The image of me that you see
Is distorted, twisted, broken, fractured 
Isolated, miles out to sea
I don't want a separate place.
I need to feel safe, not thrown away, away, away.

And I will push (push)
To tear down the walls (push, push)
Of this box you put me in (push, push)
Because you don't understand
(push ow hot, push ow ow hot) You push
To find a label that fits me.
I'm feelin' good on a Wednesday
With sparklin' thoughts
Help me unload the car, yah yah yah

And so I push
To close the door
Of the stall you've made for me,
To keep me away.
And now we push
Push to stand together
Because I am Lorde (yah yah yah)
Yah yah yah, I am Lorde
I am Lorde, yah yah yah
Yah yah yah, I am Lorde
Yah yah yah
Yah yah yah, I am Lorde

Yah yah yah

[While the song plays, the following montage flows: camera closes in on Randy's face, then on a toilet. Some of the lyrics, handwritten on yellow rule paper, scroll past. Stan looks at the restrooms again. More lyrics. The demos are playing for the record producer and Ron, and they like it. More lyrics. Two sisters listen to the song on an iPhone in the kitchen. Their mother Carol looks on from the doorway. She returns to the office the next day and stops the boss from putting up the transgender sign on a bathroom. They both listen to the song, and like it. Shelly is wearing her headphones joyfully dancing to the song. Randy looks in and smiles. Principal Victoria waves a pencil around as if she were conducting an arrangement for this song. Bebe is listening to it with Milly and Nelly in her bedroom. Butters is in his own room wearing a pink tutu and dancing away. More lyrics. Brandon Carlile is at his desk looking at his article. He moves to delete it, and it's gone. He shuts down his computer and leaves]

South Park Elementary Gymnasium that still has damage from the Butter's fire. Principal Victoria is going to announce something. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Mackey sit off to one side
Principal Victoria
And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. [cheering erupts from the students]
Cartman
I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. [pulls off his bow and throws it to the ground.]
Principal Victoria
Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
South Park Elementary, hallway. Stan heads for the boys room when Butters exits
Butters
Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
Stan
To the bathroom?
Butters
Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom! [points to the Cissies bathroom, which used to be the Other bathroom] Well go on, cissy! [Stan walks over to the cissies bathroom and goes in. Butters smiles and walks away. The cissies bathroom is just the Other bathroom with a new plaque on it. Stan claps twice and the lights go down. Vivaldi's "Spring" plays]
Stan
Wow, this is is pretty nice. [drops trousers and settles in, then begins singing]
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah

End of The Cissy

Handicar
The Bijou, night. A movie has ended, probably "Gone Girl," and moviegoers are now going home. Among them are Gerald and Sheila Broflovski, Stephen and Linda Stotch, and Bob and Linda Black.
Stephen
[with phone in hand] Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys.
Sheila
Sure. You bet.
Gerald
Are you guys parked over here?
Stephen
Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way.
Gerald
A Handicar? What's that?
Linda
You don't use Handicar?
Stephen
No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up.
Gerald
Wow...
Stephen
Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes. [sees Linda talking to the Blacks] Honey, our Handicar is here.
Timmy
Timmy! [Linda waves goodbye to the Blacks and she joins Stephen in the Handicar, driven by Timmy.]
Stephen
Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad. [The Handicar is a wheelchair with a Lil Zipper attached. The Lil Zipper is equipped with a table setting for two, including a candle and flower in vase.]
Gerald
Lucky.
Timmy
Timmy. [pulls away]
Stephen
Download the app! It works great! [Gerald whips out his phone and goes looking for the app. He finds it and downloads it.]
South Park, day. A cab goes down the street. A Russian driver is shown with his passenger
Passenger
Ahh, [pinches his nose] Excuse me, I think someone puked back here. [pinches his nose again]
Russian
You don't like puke?
Passenger
Could you turn the radio down and the air conditioning up, please?
Russian
No air conditioning. Too expensive. [the light turns red and the driver brakes hard, causing the passenger to hit his head on the back of the front seat.]
Passenger
Agh!
Russian
Not enough people taking cab. Don't know what's wrong!
Timmy
Timmih! [both driver and passenger look to the right. Timmy drives by in his wheelchair towing a man in his Lil Zipper, which is equipped with a table, tablecloth, candle, and two chairs. The man is sipping wine.]
Russian
What the fuck?
The Hummer car dealership, day. Mr. Stevenson is on the sidewalk trying to drum up some business.
Mr. Stevenson
We've got a big sales event going on, folks. [sees two men across the street] Hey guys. Can I get you in a 2014 Hummer? Rocktober sales event, guys.
Younger Man
No thanks.
Mr. Stevenson
[plays some air guitar] Only a few more guitar licks left in Rocktober, guys.
Older Man
We're good. Shut up! [Timmy pulls up]
Younger Man
Oh, here's our Handicar.
Timmy
Timmy. [he stops, and the men get in.]
Mr. Stevenson
The fuck?
A meeting room, day. Three counselors stand before a group of handicapped kids. Among them are Jimmy, Francis, and Timmy. Counselor Steve begins to speak
Steve
All right, kids, you know what time of year this is? [the handicapped kids cheer] That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp?
All
Yeeaahhh!
Steve
So far, Jimmy has raised $16!
All
Yeeaahhh!
Steve
Francis has raised $29.32 [the kids cheer] And Timmy has raised $2,063.00!
Timmy
Timmy! [the other kids cheer]
Steve
All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time! [the kids cheer. Off to the side, in the open doorway, are Nathan and Mimsy.]
Nathan
[turns around. Mimsy does too.] I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.
Mimsy
D'awww, we don't like camp, boss?
Nathan
We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks.
Mimsy
D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark. [laughs. Nathan jumps in the air and smacks Mimsy on the right cheek with his left hand]
Nathan
Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast.
Mimsy
D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss?
Nathan
Shh-shh. [the counselor reaches them]
Steve
Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?
Nathan
Yes, Counselor Steve. We like the tug-of-waaarr.
Steve
All right. Well, just keep working on those donations. [leaves]
Nathan
Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past.
Mimsy
D'oh boy!
Park County Community Center, night. The parking lot is full of cabs. Inside are three SP Taxi drivers, an SP Cabbie, and Mr. Stevenson
SP Cabbie
[wears an SP Cab hat] We are united as brothers, because jast as Handicar has taken away jobs from honest, hard-working cab drivers, it's also taken food [slams his fist on the podium] from the mouths of the children of car salesmen!
Mr. Stevenson
Well I don't have any children.
Russian
Who does this handicapped boy think he is?! He's not even in union!
Arab
He's taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient.
SP Cabbie
Aaand, because he's handicapped, he can use special access points and parking spaces. That kid was born with an unfair advantage!
Arab
Who is this rat?!
Nathan
His name is Timmy Burch. [the adults turn to look at him] And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.
American
Who are you?!
Nathan
Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.
Russian
Nobody takes jobs away from US! We need to speak to Mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business!
Arab
Or maybe we can have the police shut him down!
Mimsy
Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace?
Nathan
Just ignore my friend. He's mentally disabled.
Mimsy
Aw yeah, don't mind me.
Nathan
Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?
Mr. Stevenson
Offer it last year's Christmas in Rocksummer prizes?
Nathan
No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake! [the drivers look at each other]
Timmy's room, night. He's fast asleep when several shadows pop up outside his window. It turns out to be the SP cabbie, followed by the Russian and Arab cabbies.
SP Cabbie
Hey wake up, you little scab!
Timmy
[waking up] Tutih Tuh-Timmih?
SP Cabbie
We got a message for ya! From the union. [holds up a bat. The three cab drivers begin beating Timmy with baseball bats]
South Park, next day, daytime. Nathan and Mimsy walk along a sidewalk
Nathan
Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome. [The curb has a line of cabs on it, and they come across the cabbies who visited Timmy the night before.] Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem?
SP Cabbie
Yeah, we sure did!
Russian
Let's just say he'll be laid up a while.
SP Cabbie
Yeah. We snuck in his room last night and we... broke his legs!
Nathan
Oh boy, that's great-wait, you what??
Timmy
Timmy! [drives by, seemingly unharmed]
Randy
[taking a ride in the Handicar] I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.
Russian
But we broke his legs. Both of them.
Nathan
Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!
The park, sometime later. Nathan and Mimsy sit on a bench
Nathan
How can people be so ineffectual, Mimsy?
Mimsy
D'uh I don't know, boss.
Nathan
These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.
Mimsy
D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr.
Nathan
[smacks him again] Shut up, Mimsyyyy!
In another part of town, Timmy is driving a woman home
Woman 1
Right here is good. [gets off at her house] Thank you. I can just use the app to tip you, right?
Timmy
Timmy!
Woman 1
Ohohh, this is so handy! [goes to the front door] Thank you!
Timmy
Timmy. [gets a new call from an unknown caller and answers it] Tiiimmih Timmih.
Nathan
Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.
Timmy
Timmih!
Nathan
Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.
Timmy
[sighs] Timmih.
Nathan
I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.
Timmy
[thinking it over] Hmmm, Timmih.
Nathan
I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.
Timmy
[smiles] Timmy! [grins. He likes the idea]
Nathan
That's great. Summer camp, here we come. [hangs up] Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!
A neighborhood, sometime later. Nathan is now in a wheelchair as a new Handicar driver
Mimsy
D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em?
Nathan
It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.
Mimsy
D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss?
Nathan
It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.
Mimsy
D'ah oh boy!
Later, Nathan goes on his first drive as a Handicar driver. His phone indicates that he has a passenger waiting for a pick up close by
Nathan
[arrives] Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in. [she gets in without saying a word] So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?
Woman 2
[a transvestite] Sure. Would you like to see mine?
Nathan
Uh oh!
At the Men's restroom in the park, Nathan is heard getting pounded with some funny sound effects
Nathan
Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy! [Mimsy approaches, but stays outside. The passenger exits the restroom and walks away. Nathan waddles out, hair and clothes disheveled] And I thought a shark was bad. [cartoon flourish at the end]
The Broflovski house, evening. Gerald and Sheila exit and lock the door
Gerald
Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.
Stephen
Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila.
Gerald
Stephen, what are you doing?
Stephen
You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in. [Gerald and Sheila get in, and Stephen pulls away.] I'm telling you Gerald, havin' a Handicar is a great way to make some money on the side. [other Handicar drivers begin to appear]
HC Driver 1
Timmy!
Stephen
Timmy!
HC Driver 2
[a woman] Timmy!
Stephen
The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald.
Mimsy
[standing at a street corner with Nathan] D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss.
HC Driver 3
[getting too close to the curb] 'Scuse me, out of my way, please. I have a Handicap. [drives off]
Nathan
I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!
Mimsy
D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. Ah "I drove a Lincoln way before I got paid to drive one." Drrrr. [Nathan smacks him again]
Nathan
Shut up Mimsyyy!
Tesla demonstration
Announcer
[female] For the pat eight years Tesla has been the leading innovator in the world of automotive transport. And now the President and CEO of Tesla Motorcars, Elon Musk. [a robotic arm reaches out and grabs a platform behind one of the cars, and Elon Musk is on the platform. The arm sets him down at the foot of the stage as cameas flash away]
Elon Musk
Today I am proud to announce the Tesla D, the most innovative and efficient world-friendly mode of transportation ever created. Any questions?
Reporter 1
Yes, ahh, what about Handicar?
Elon Musk
What about it?!
Reporter 2
Well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to ride-share is even more convenient and eco-friendly than electric cars.
Reporter 3
How do you intend to compete with this boy genius in Colorado? [Elon Musk is not happy]
Tesla Headquarters. day. An issue of of Tech Today is dropped onto a table next to a Tesla cup of coffee.
Elon Musk
I am so sick of hearing about app-based ride-sharing! The future of transportation is the electric cars, not wheelchairs!
Exec. 1
Don't worry, Elon. Handicar is just a small company.
Exec. 2
Oh sure, operating in a few small towns, but when they start absorbing the taxi markets, bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world, driving your kids to and from school, delivering both people and things?
Exec. 3
We can't compete with Handicar! It's just so damned handy!
Elon Musk
If there is a way to reduce Handicar's positive publicity, then we need to do it now! [walks to the table and plants his hands on it] And you! You say it's theoretically possible?
Nathan
Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?
Elon Musk
Who's the sheepherder?
Nathan
You are.
Exec. 4
Who's the snake?
Nathan
Handicar. [a few seconds of silence follow]
Mimsy
D'ah, it's an analogy.
Nathan
[smacks Mimsy] Shut up Mimsyyy! [to Elom Musk] If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing your sheep, all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity. [the Tesla execs look around at each other]
South Park, day. Timmy is driving around town with a male passenger on his iPad.
HC Driver 4
[going the other way on the street] Timmy!
Timmy
Timmy! [stops at an intersection. A Tesla car speeds up next to him. The passenger window comes down and Nathan looks at him]
Nathan
Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?
Timmy
Timmih! [holds his right thumb up]
Nathan
[looks ahead] That's great. I can't wait for camp this year. [looks at Timmy again] We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?
Elon Musk
Good day to you!
Timmy
Timmih!
Nathan
Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.
Mimsy
[pops up] D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss?
Elon Musk
Shut up, Mimsy! [Mimsy reclines in his seat]
Nathan
Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. [the passenger window goes up, and they peel awat. The resulting wake almost blows the tablecloth off and Timmy's passenger almost losing his iPad keeping the tablecloth in place, At Skeeter's Bar and Coctails, a drunk patron walks out and a Handicar driver arrives to pick him up. He gets in, and they go away]
Skeeter's Bar and Coctails, day, interior. Jimbo looks up at a TV monitor
Jimbo
Hey everyone, you need to see this! [CNN Breaking News]
CNN Anchor
[with glasses] What started as a simple contest is quickly escalating into an international crisis. As electronic cars challenge the oil industry, and transportation alternatives fight for dominance, the unavoidable outcome may be a conflict the likes the world has not seen since the '70s. It appears that the world is once again on the brink [takes off his glasses] of Wacky Races.
Randy
Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
CNN Anchor
The prime minister of Japan (Shinzo Abe is shown) insisted that any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. They also claim that if a race does take place, they would have no choice but to enter their completely self-driven prototype Lexus into the conflict. The Canadians and Chinese are also saying they would be forced to race, and no one yet has heard from Dick Dastardly or Muttley. Unless a miracle happens, this Saturday morning the world will witness the fist Wacky Races in nearly 50 years.
Food 4 Little, day. Shoppers rush in and get all the cereal they can get
Shoppers
Wacky Races oh God! Wacky Races oh my God! Oh my God Wacky Races oh my God!
Gerald
Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
Randy
I know! Are we watching at your house?!
Manager
That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal!
Shoppers
No! I didn't get any! That guy has two! [more clamoring]
Manager
There's none left, don't you understand?!
The park at South Park, day. All the Handicar drivers are assembled, and Stephen Stotch holds court.
Stephen
Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
HC Driver 5
Don't do the race. You don't have to prove anything. [Timmy is shown, weary]
HC Driver 6
He HAS to do it, don't you see? He has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible. There are hundreds of people with handicaps now.
Timmy
Timmih...
HC Driver 7
But isn't that the problem? I mean, let's face it, it's not like he's able to keep the driver quality up. Anyone can have a Handicap now. I mean, even Matthew McConaughey is a Handicar driver now, for Chrit's sake!
Matthew McConaughey
Hey. [rolls up] I was drivin' a Handicar... way before I got paid to drive one. I just like how it feels.
Stephen
Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry. [loses control of the wheelchair] Hold on, sorry, went too far. [comes back around] This is your opportunity to make Handicar thee transportation of thte future. Think what you could do with all that money. [Timmy begins to think over this]
Wacky Races, Saturday morning. Each driver and car are shown as they are announced.
Announcer
And here they are, the most daredevil group of shared-ride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the Wacky Races, competing for the title of the future of transportation. Cars are approaching the starting line. First off is the Lyft car [a purple sedan with a huge pink mustache on the grill], a ride-sharing company out of San Francisco. next up is the ZipCar, a pay-by-the-hour concept based on Chinese bicycles. Maneuvering for position is the standard taxicab driven by an angry Russian. Right behind is the Hummer salesman in his 2014 Hummer No Class. And there's ingenious inventor Elon Musk in his new Tesla D. Oh, and here's the lovely Canadian actress Neve Campbell in the Canadian conept vehicle The Queef, powered completely on female natural gas. [she queefs to make it go faster] Next we have the Handicar with Timmy Burch. And there's the completely automated self-driving car from Japan. Limping along last are those double-dealing do-badders Dick Dasterdly and his sidekick Muttley. [Muttley snickers] And away they go on the way out Wacky Races. [a shot of the adults gathered in the Broflovski living room, with milk and Franken Berry and Kap'n Krunch cereals on the coffee table] And this live coverage of the event will be broadcast all morning, of course, on CNN.
Stuart
Jesus. It's begun.
Gerald
God help them all.
Randy
All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.

You are watching BBC World.
BBC Anchor
The vioent conflict over transport is underway, and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember. We return you now to our live coverage of.. the Wacky Races.
Wacky Races, Saturday monring. The race is well underway across Colorado.
Announcer
As the Wacky Raccers roll down the roadway, we see that the taxicab in in the lead, with Handicar pulling up the rear.
Timmy
[way in back] Timmih!
Announcer
[a map shows up] All the cars must follow the same route. First they'll leave the town of South Park, then navigate through Giggling Gulch on the final stretch to pick up the passenger, a Miss Dotty Applegate. Once the passenger is picked up, the vehicle must successfully deliver her to the destination point at her daughter's house in Morrison. [back to the race] It looks like the ZipCar is trying to vie for position past the Hummer vehicle. It's neck and neck as the Wacky Racers all push to be first to pick up the passenger. [An elderly lady waits for her ride at a Thrift Or Less store] Miss Applegate is waiting patiently. [the racers are shown] And Elon Musk's Tesla appears to take the lead.
Nathan
Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.
Elon Musk
But I though we wanted Handicar to lose the race!
Nathan
He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him. [he shows off a control pad]
Mimsy
D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel? [Nathan and Elon just look at him] You know, tell 'em you don't wanna go and just see how they react. [they keep loooking at him, and he gets a clue] Wait wait, I got it. [smacks himself] Shut up, Mimsy!
Nathan
Hey Mimsy.
Mimsy
[leans forward] Yeah?
Nathan
[smacks him] Shut up! [Mimsy sits back]
Announcer
The Canadian car overtakes the self-driving car. And now here comes the ZipCar, which is being driven by Matthew McConaughey.
Matthew McConaughey
[nice mood music in the car] I was drivin' a ZipCar... way before I got paid to drive one.
Announcer
And look at this! The Lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger. [Ms Applegate gets into the back seat, and the Lyft driver takes off] Now the Lyft car must take the passenger to her destination, but look at this! The Hummer salesman is running the Lyft car off the road! And the Hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself!
Mr. Stevenson
[pitching the Hummer to her] You've got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here. What do you think? Huh? Can you see yourself in one of these puppies?
Announcer
Elon Musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the Hummer out of commission for good. [a cannon rises out of the Tesla and fires a shot at the Hummer. The missile hits the Hummer and blows it up.]
Gerald
Wow.
Randy
Geez!
Stuart
God.
Randy
Did you see that?! Oh!
Announcer
The passenger is being taken to the Tesla D now. [Mr. Stevenson is dead, the Hummer is totaled. Musk escorts Miss Applegate, but the South Park taxi driver scoops her up] No way! She just got snatched by the pissed off Russian in his taxi. Miss Applegate is now in the back of the taxi and she's being forced to watch Jimmy Fallon. [Fallon is rubbing a giant pickle in his guest's face. Meanwhile, The Queef has stupped running] Uh oh, the Canadian car has completely run out of queefs. [Heve tries three times, but there are no more queefs in her] With the race neearly over, it's taxi out in front followed by self-driving car, and then pulling up in third is Handicar!
Timmy
Timmih!
Announcer
It's gonna be a close one!
Dick Dastardly
Not too close, Boopsie! [Muttley snickers]
Announcer
Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again.
Randy
Ohh! Ohh! Duuude! [Dick Dastardly saws a tree in two, and the tree falls on the taxi, destroying it and the self-driving car that runs into the taxi. The adults in the Broflovski living room react to this]
Gerald
Oh no! Ohh!
Sharon
Oh no, I can't watch! [shields her face.]
Randy
Oooo! Booom!
Mrs. McCormick
Ohohohh!
Stuart
Nice! Oh yeah! [Sheila just hides her eyes]
Announcer
And there's Handicar to pick Miss Applegate up. [she climbs in and the Tesla is pulling up fast]
Nathan
That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet! [sees a bunch of cars closing in on him on his phone] Wait a minute. What the hell are all those cars? [lowers his window] Holy shit! [sees a fleet of Handicar drivers coming at the Tesla]
HC drivers
Timmy! Timmy! [the drivers just bunch up on the Tesla and push it over on its side]
Elon Musk
Aaaaaah!
HC drivers
Timmy!
Announcer
We're near the finish line; the race is almost over. Handicar is in the lead, still way out in front of the ZipCar driven by Matthew McConaughey. [a shot of Matthew listening to his mood music]
Matthew McConaughey
Sometimes you gotta go forward by goin' backward. Are we drivin' cars or are cars... drivin' us?
Announcer
Dastardly car is racing past both. [Nathan and Mimsy hijacked it. Mimsy is driving] This could be an upset, folks. [Mimsy makes a U-turn and parks the Dastardly car off the road. He and Nathan get out]
Timmy
Timmih!
Nathan
Goodnight, you son of a bitch! [the ZipCar reaches them and Nathan presses the detonator on his control pad. The ZipCar blows up. Mimsy and Nathan take notice] Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!
Mimsy
D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!
Nathan
Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves! [secondary explosions create a portal above Matthew McConaughey, and he's sucked in]
Announcer
Oh my, it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with Matthew McConaughey inside.
Matthew McConaughey
Mimsy! [the car levitates a bit, but as soon as the wormhole is gone, it falls back on the road]
Announcer
And there's the finish. It looks like Handicar has done it!
Timmy
Timmih! [the handicapped kids all cheer]
The meeting room, day. Steve gives Timmy a ribbon
Steve
A big congratulations to our fundraising champion! After selling the Handicar rights to Elon Musk, Timmy has raised 2.3 billion dollars for summer camp. [the kids cheer] Great job to all of you. This is sure to be the best summer camp ever! [more cheering]
Nathan's house, night.
Nathan's Mom
All set for bed, honey?
Nathan
Yeah I like to sleep at nighttime.
Nathan's Mom
All right, goodnight. [kisses him on the temple and heads for the door]
Nathan
Wait! [she stops] Wait, Mom? Can we talk?
Nathan's Mom
Um... yes, o-of course. [sits down on his bed]
Nathan
This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.
Nathan's Mom
I'm sorry, I can't understand you honey. You're handicapped.
Nathan
What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!
Nathan's Mom
You want water? Is that what you want?
Nathan
No! I don't wanna go to camp!
Nathan's Mom
Ohhh yes, okay honey, I'll turn off the lamp. [gets up, turns it off, and walks out, closing the door behind her]
Nathan
No! That's not what I fucking said! [stumbles around in his room] Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!
Outside Nathan's room
Nathan's Dad
What's he saying?
Nathan's Mom
That he doesn't wanna go to summer camp this year, but I'll be damned if he's gonna ruin our Italy trip.
Nathan's Dad
Right.
Nathan
[still stumbling in his room] Oh! Aah! Mimsy!
End of Handicar

The Magic Bush
Butters' room, day. He's at his computer singing to himself.
Butters
Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
Cartman
[opens Butters' door and enters] Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
Butters
Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
Cartman
[heads for Butters' bed] Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl! [gets on Butters' bed and lays down on his back.] I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
Butters
I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
Cartman
No it isn't.
Butters
My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
Cartman
That's stupid.
Butters
You can see the momma bird fly in.
Cartman
I'm dying of boredom.
Butters
We took all kinds of video with his drone.
Cartman
[sits up, suddenly interested] What did you say?
Butters
[looks over his shoulder] You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
Cartman
Your dad has a fucking drone?
Butters' house, day. Butters and Cartman lift up the garage door and behold the drone
Cartman
Whooaa! [runs up to it for a closer look]
Butters
It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
Cartman
[pulls his finger back and smiles at Butters] You wanna take it out for a spin?
Butters
Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
Cartman
[runs up to Butters and stands next to him] Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
Butters
My dad said it's not for spying on people.
Cartman
Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
Butters
Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
Cartman
Okay, good idea. [picks up the drone] We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
Butters
[goes to take the drone back] No, Eric. I don't wanna d-
Stephen
[off screen] Butters?
Cartman
Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go! [leaves the garage with the drone as Butters faces the source of the call, then pulls down the garage door] I'll see you later at my house.
Stephen
Butters, are you home??
Butters
Comin' dad! [leaves the garage through the side door into the house]
Cartman's house, night. He's been working with the drone, figuring out how to operate it. There's a knock on his door.
Cartman
Butters, is that you?
Butters
Yes, it's me.
Cartman
[opens the door just a crack and peeks out] Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
Butters
Of course not!
Cartman
Alright, come in. [opens the door to reveal Kenny] Kenny's here; I told him all about it. [Kenny waves hello]
Butters
What?! You said nobody would know!
Cartman
It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out. [outside, the drone sits in the grass in the backyard, 50 feet away from the house. Suddenly it rises to 23 feet, above the boys' heads, then veers to the right] Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! [the drone's camera shows some backyards through a fish-eye lens. A dog barks up at it from below.]
Butters
Be careful! The powerlines!
Cartman
Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards! [in the distance, Kenny's house is shown from the back two blocks away. The drone veers to the right and drops down a bit, headed for a back door] Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
Kenny
(Okay, try to get closer!)
Butters
Okay, uh maybe that's enough. [the drone approaches Craig's window]
Cartman
Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh. [Craig is shown at his computer. The drone moves to the next window and shows Craig's mom undressing.] Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
Kenny
(Are you serious?!)
Butters
[gruffly] Let me see!
Cartman
Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
Kenny
(Stop taping!)
Butters
Jeeeeezz!
Cartman
This thing is recording, right?
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Cartman
Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that? [Craig's mom has heard the drone and called her husband Thomas over. She stands behind him as they both look at the drone outside their window] Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! [thrusts the controller at Butters]
Butters
What do I do?!
Cartman
His dad sees you!
Butters
[begins to panic] I don't know what to do!
Cartman
Fly back to the house, stupid!
The Stotch house, night. Thomas Tucker bangs on the front door and Stephen comes to answer it.
Thomas
You've got a problem, Stotch!
Stephen
What are you talkin' about?
Thomas
You know what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone!
Stephen
Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct.
Thomas
Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!
Stephen
I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you.
The Stotch house, garage. Stephen leads Thomas to the garage. He opens the side door
Stephen
There, you see? It's right there. [sure enough, the drone and its controller are on the garage floor as expected.]
Thomas
So, thuh so you flew it back here in time.
Stephen
I swear I didn't fly it.
Thomas
Well these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! [hurries out of the garage. Stephen looks at the drone and wonders... spooky theremin music plays, so he's a little afraid as well]
Butters' room, night. Stephen opens Butters' door and looks in
Stephen
Butters?
Butters
[already in his PJs and in bed, but clearly panting] Oh, heh-hey dad.
Stephen
Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?
Butters
[panting throughout] Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
Stephen
Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you.
Butters
I love you too, Dad. [Stephen leaves and closes the door. That was close.]
South Park, morning. At the bus stop, Cartman and Kenny wait for the school bus
Cartman
Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
Kenny
(Yeah, I know, dude.)
Cartman
Not a word, Kenny!
Kenny
(Alright!) [Stan and Kyle's voices are heard]
Stan
Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
Kyle
Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
Stan
I know. [they take their places next to Cartman]
Cartman
Hey you guys.
Stan
Sup? [the pressure gets to Cartman, but he resists. He finally cracks]
Cartman
You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
Kenny
(Dude! What the fuck!)
Stan
What?
Cartman
Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? [whips out his phone]
Kenny
(Dude!)
Kyle
That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
Cartman
You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
Kyle
Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
Stan
Let me see.
Cartman
[shows Stan] Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.
Stan
How'd you get that on your phone?
Cartman
Oh. Um, uh... Kenny? [motions for Kenny to get closer, but Kenny doesn't budge] Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
Kenny
[grudgingly] (Uh huh.)
Kyle
That's terrible!
Cartman
I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
South Park Elementary, later. Craig is at his locker when Jimmy, Token and Clyde approach him
Jimmy
Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? [he and the other two chuckle]
Craig
What are you talking about? [Cartman comes into view at the end of the hall and walks towards the boys room]
Jimmy
Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers. [he and the other two chuckle. Cartman chuckles as well]
Craig
For what?
Jimmy
Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. [he and the other two chuckle. Butters comes out of nowhere and shoves Cartman into the boys room, slamming him into the stall 1 wall]
Butters
What the heck are you doing?!
Cartman
Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
Butters
When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
Cartman
Butters-
Butters
You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
Cartman
Butters. Butters.
Butters
Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
Cartman
Butters, I had to! [Butters lets him go] Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
Butters
WHY?!
Cartman
Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
Butters
I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
Cartman
Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! [they leave the restroom. Stall 1 opens and Kyle steps out, angry at what he just heard]
Neighborhood Watch meeting, Roger Donovan's house, evening.
Roger
Hi everyone. For those of you I don't know as well, my name is Roger Donovan, and un, just like you I'm pretty upset about what's going on in our neighborhood.
Thomas
How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!
Roger
Yes, well luckily nobody's watched the video of course. [a round of denials from the gathered adults] But the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular. I mean, anyone can get a drone off Amazon for 200 bucks, and there's no laws and the whole thing is pretty damned hairy. Oh-ohh, God I'm sorry Laura. [she looks around and gets mad] You know I I meant the situation is pretty hairy, right? Nothin' to do with you p-personally. I mean, how would I even know? I didn't see it. [she crosses her arms] Um...
Randy
[stands up] Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush. [winces. Sharon puts her face in her left hand] Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. [sits down and looks at Sharon]
Laura Tucker
You know, it used to be called "natural". Completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing.
Thomas
It's okay honey, the-
Laura
But now, because I "choose" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be,
Randy
Eeww.
Laura
I'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster!
Roger
And and and that's the point. I mean, we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing, that that-
Laura
I'm not embarrassed about it! It's natural!
Stuart
It's a lot of natural.
Roger
Look, look, why we're here is because it's gonna take all of us, a neighborhood watch, to make sure that our community stays safe.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?
Randy
It's simple.
The neighborhood, day. The first Neighborhood Watch drone, which is black, appears, followed by more drones.
Randy
Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. [smiles]
The bus stop. The four boys are there. A Neighborhood Watch drone flies over it and then flies off.
Kyle
Are you happy now?!
Cartman
What? [the drone returns and goes the other way]
Kyle
Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
Cartman
What does that have to do with me?
Kyle
See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
Cartman
Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
Kyle
I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman! [another drone floats by in the background] I know what-
Cartman
You were what?!
Kyle
I was in the bathroom-
Cartman
You were spying on me?!
Kyle
No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
Cartman
But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
Kyle
How is that spying?!
Cartman
You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! [another drone hovers by]
A strip mall, day. One of the stores there is The Hobby Enthusiast. Stephen and Butters go inside.
Clerk
Hello, can I help you?
Stephen
Yes, I'd like to return this drone. [sets it on the counter. The clerk looks through the open box]
Clerk
You wanna return it?
Stephen
Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore.
Clerk
The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? [Butters puts his arms tight against his sides and glances here and there]
Stephen
Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it... [leans in] flies by itself.
Clerk
Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it.
Stephen
[stands straight] You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked. [leans in] The battery was half empty.
Clerk
[looks at Butters, then back at Stephen] I'm sorry, but we don't do returns. [Butters relaxes a bit]
Stephen
Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about.
Clerk
Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. [Butters tenses up again]
Stephen
You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.
Clerk
Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?
Stephen
No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision. [looks down to his right, then to his left. The clerk fixes his gaze on him]
A closeup of Thomas putting his pants on. He hears a Neighborhood Watch drone buzz by and looks out his bedroom windows
Thomas
Oh for God's sakes! [goes into the bathroom, where he sees Laura at the sink, having just gotten out of the shower. He also sees another drone outside the window, which has open curtains] Goddamnit get the hell out of here! [the drone hurries away, and he goes to the window and closes the curtains] That DOES IT!
Park County Police Department, day. The Tuckers are there to file a police report
Thomas
You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!
Officer 1
But they aren't illegal, Mr. Tucker.
Thomas
Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!
Sgt. Yates
Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day.
Officer 1
We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't-
Laura
I haven't been "humiliated", I've been wronged! We are here to ask for your help, now are you gonna help us or not?!
Officer 1
Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.
Officer 2
Or perhaps a forest ranger?
Thomas
Help us with the drones spying on us!!
Sgt. Yates
All right, all right. We'll do everything we can.
South Park Elementary, day. Cartman walks by the boys restroom when Butters comes at him again and shoves him into the restroom, again slamming him into the stall 1 wall.
Butters
Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
Cartman
Butters.
Butters
Why would you turn "Craig's mom's bush" into a music video starring us?!
Cartman
Because, Butters-
Butters
Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
Cartman
[brushes Butters' hands off his jacket] Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay- [stops and kneels down to see if there's anyone in the stall, then gets up again] Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
Butters
Why?!
Cartman
Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. "Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one."
Butters
That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
Cartman
Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
The neighborhood, night. A Neighborhood Watch drone flies around and hones in on the Broflovski house. Gerald is on the couch eating a slice of cake and watching TV - Real Housewives of Atlanta.
Randy
Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta.
Sharon
You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
Randy
I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing. [the drone leaves the Broflovski house and hovers over to the Neloson house, where Nelson is having sex with his girl. Randy puts his wine glass on the bedstand and concentrates on the video feed. He glances at Sharon a few times to see if she's noticing. She isn't. Soon, a police drone appears, with blue and red flashing lights and a siren. It aims for Randy's drone.] Oh shit! [gets his drone to fly off, but the police drone keeps up] Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch! [has the drone turn to face the police drone, which is armed. The police drone fires two rounds into Randy's drone, which falters. Sharon finally looks over] I've been shot! [his drone crashes into a backyard] No! Noooo!
News 4 breaking news.
Anchor
Shock and outrage all over the state tonight after an on-duty police drone chased and shot down an unarmed civilian drone, and worst of all, yes, the civilian drone was black. [a picture of a similar drone pops up behind him]
Jimbo
What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
Randy
I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
Farmer
It was about yay big. [strokes the back of his head] I mean the hair on it was out to here [spreads his arms out so there's three feet between his hands], and then it had another trail of hair down from her belly button. I mean, the, the drone. Yeah, that's what I saw. That that's all I saw.
Anchor
While police claim they were only following standard protocol, the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil.
Downtown South Park, night. A group of civilian drones hovers down the street, each drone holding a lit candle. Sirens and lights come up and the drones turn right to see police drones approaching
Police drone
Please disperse. Candles on top of drones are a fire hazard, [the civilian drones look at each other] Return to your garages.
Mr. Garrison
[on his bed holding the controller and a glass of wine] What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?
Steve
[on his bed with Linda, his wife] Just hover, honey. They can't do anything if we're just hovering.
Randy's house, later. Someone is banging on his front door, and he goes to answer it. It's Stephen, with Butters on the sidewalk
Stephen
[looking frazzled] Randy. We need to talk.
Randy
Okay.
Stephen
Inside. [Randy lets him in and moments later sits on the sofa with Sharon and Butters. Stephen paces the floor before them] I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news. [walks up to Randy] Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?
Randy
No. I didn't. [theremin music starts up as Stephen walks back to where he was]
Stephen
I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.
Randy
What might be?
Stephen
Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??
Randy
...Drones are spooky?
Stephen
If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby.
News 4 news break.
Anchor
The town of South Park has become a hotbed of tension with civilians lashing out at police. After police used excessive force at a peaceful protest, the town has now broken out into full-scale riots. [sure enough, there are riots all over the place, but no humans are rioting. It's all the drones. One drone crashes into a building, then bounces off it and into a car through the windshield. Another drown crashes through Tele's display window and two others make off with a flatscreen TV] As the people of South Park continue to protest, the South Park police are now ordering a mandatory reverse curfew. The governor has asked for help from the National Guard to bring order to the town.
South Park, day. National Guard drones begin flying into town. In one house, a woman goes to undress. A drone stops by to get a closer look, and a second one joins it, then they both fly off. The woman hears the buzzing and looks out her window.
20/20 preview
Announcer
Tonight on an all-new 20/20. [a Viper probe droid appears onscreen...] A town in crisis over the matter of privacy. [...and gets a red "NO" circle stamped on it] Now for the first time we sit down and talk to the mom behind the bush.
The Tucker house. A 20/20 reporter is interviewing Thomas and Laura in low light
Reporter
You've become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues.
Laura
I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring Neighborhood Watch drones. I mean, where does it stop?
Reporter
It just... keeps going on and on. Kind of like your... [Laura gets mad] I mean... it just... goes outside what most people would call... acceptable.
Laura
Have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005?! It's not that weird!
Thomas
It's okay, honey.
Reporter
I didn't see the video. I don't believe in doing that, but uh... I'm just saying that... the situation in in your town is... unwieldy? [the power begins to flicker and on monitors everywhere the image of Stephen appears, with Butters behind him. Stephen now has facial hair and a paranoid look about him]
Stephen
Please do not adjust your televisions!
Reporter
What is that?
Stephen
My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby. [a shot of Gerald and Sheila in bed with their glasses of wine and their controllers] All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page, [holds up a printout of the YouTube page] it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did? [a shot of Gerald and Sheila, then Steve and Linda] We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!
Cartman's house, day. His doorbell rings and he goes to answer it. It's Butters, and behind him are police drones and National Guard drones
Cartman
Oh hey Butters. Sup?
Butters
Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
Cartman
Dude, what's the matter?
Butters
I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
Cartman
Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. [takes Butters in and closes the door]
Butters
I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
Cartman
Butters.
Butters
I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
Cartman
[while Butters speaks] Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
Butters
I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
Cartman
Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
Butters
You do?
Cartman
Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
Butters
What?
Cartman
Your dad's drone.
Butters
NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
Cartman
Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
Butters
...Okay.
Butters' house, night. Stephen is at the sofa preparing a sizeable bomb. He's soldering the ends of a cable together, then takes a sip of spirits, then picks up a grenade launcher and pops a grenade in place. He stands up
Stephen
Time to end this hobby once and for all! [he moves stealthily to his garage, opens the door, and jumps in ready to blow his drone up, but finds it missing again] No! NOOOO!
Cartman's house. Kenny is back with Butters and Cartman as Cartman gets ready to execute his next big idea.
Cartman
[with the controller] Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
Butters
If this doesn't work, we're dead.
Cartman
It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. [he gets the drone going. It rises, pulling behind it a blow-up doll made to resemble Laura, with a large bushy wig over the crotch. The drone and doll hover away from Cartman's house.]
Park County Police Station, night. The police drones, some with shields, hover over the civilian drones. A news drone flies by. Both sides jockey for positions, but then notice the National Guard drones arriving. One of the civilian drones then notices the sex doll floating by. The doll floats up to the police drones and National Guard drones and they take notice too. The doll floats away and all the drones, civilian, police, and National Guard, follow. The doll floats through the town gathering more and more drones. It goes over the bridge and across Stark's Pond, luring all the drones away. Where they ended up is anybody's guess.
A convention room, night, several days later. Stephen Stotch is at the podium with the rest of the town seated at tables. Everyone is applauding the Tuckers, but Laura isn't pleased.
Stephen
We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said "No more!" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away. [more applause, and Laura buries her face in her right hand. A minstrel with lute comes out to sing Laura's praises]
Minstrel
Have you heard the tale of Craig's mom's bush
And the night that it saved us from drones?
Nobody knew the power it had.
They just thought it was shaggy and gross.
Craig's mom live a life of shame and despair
Everyone feared her great giant bush!

Laura
They didn't!
Minstrel
But then when drones were filling the sky,
She unfurled her bush and she used it to fly.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Gargantuan thicket of madness.
Bigger than earth and denser than gold.
Truly a magical bush to behold.

Butters' and Cartman's table. Butters is a bit distraught. The minstrel continues with the lute and some whistling
Cartman
Well, you see Butters, everything worked out. [Butters doesn't respond] "Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass."
Butters
Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
Cartman
[taken aback, then sighs] Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
Butters
No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
Cartman
You're welcome. [the minstrel begins to sing again]
Minstrel
And she flew and she flew away into the sun
And then she died.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Truly a magical bush to behold.

End of The Magic Bush

Freemium Isn't Free
South Park Elementary, day. The hallway is full of students. Kyle walks down the hallway. Jimmy passes him going the other way, but notices him and walks over.
Jimmy
Oh! Hey, Kyle! [Kyle looks over his shoulder] Kyle, hang on a sec. [He's holding his phone, on which is a Terrance & Phillip game]
Kyle
[turns to face him] Hey, Jimmy. What's up?
Jimmy
Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.
Kyle
Oh. Really?
Jimmy
Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?
Kyle
[considers it for a moment] Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
Jimmy
You betcha, pal. [grins. Kyle turns and walks away and the grin fades. Jimmy turns and continues on his way]
Close-up view of the Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game
Announcer
The Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game. [The game goes from the splash screen to a layout of their town, starting at their house. Coins float over the streets, ready to be grabbed. The announcer pops into view] In this game, you are Terrance & Phillip. Can you collect all the Canadian coins? *poot* [disappears.]
South Park Elementary, side entrance. Kyle has downloaded the game and is now playing it while Butters sits next to him on the steps and watches. Kyle taps on a coin...
Announcer
That's one coin. Can you collect more? [Kyle taps on more coins on the screen] You've collected ten Canadian coins! [a big red 10 appears on a yellow star] Congratulations! [that word, also in red, appears above the 10] Hey, you're really good at this, guy!
Kyle
What?
Butters
Congratulations, Kyle.
Announcer
[pops up again] With Canada coins, you can buy stuff that helps Terrance & Phillip rebuild Canada. [only five buildings, all houses, are shown, with the rest of the area being undeveloped] Run around and collect more coins, or better yet, buy them in bulk! [a Royal Bank price chart appears, with purchases going from 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents to 5700 for $50] How many Canadian coins would you like to buy?
Kyle
This is stupid!
Butters
Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. [Kyle taps on the button and coins pop out at him]
Announcer
You buy 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents! You're amazing! Now use that Canadough to help rebuild Canada! Click to build a hospital here. [a floating red arrow pops up on the empty block across from Terrance & Phillip's house. Kyle taps on it and the hospital appears]
Terrance & Phillip
Yaaay!
Kyle
It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
Cartman
[approaching wit Kenny] What are you two boners doing?
Butters
We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
Cartman
I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
Kyle
Who makes this crap?
The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. It's a busy place, as suits go in and out of the building. A hockey skater zips by on the street with a puck. Inside, in a meeting room, two men are at a table. One of them is on a laptop while the other watches. The meeting room is ringed with curtains
Minister
Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!
Prince
Where is the roof on this thing?
Terrance
[the double doors burst open and Terrance & Phillip storm their way in] What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!
Minister
Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?
Phillip
What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
Prince
Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming.
Minister
We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.
Phillip
It's the dumbest game ever! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
Prince
Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!
Phillip
But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!
Minister
[low voice] They see through the charade.
Prince
Uh oh, you think so?
Minister
I think they see through the charade, yes.
Prince
I'm pretty sure they can hear us too. [Yes, and they're not pleased one bit.]
Minister
Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up! [walks up to a large heavy rope and pulls on it. A bell sounds and the curtain around the room go up, revealing white boards that show how the mobile game is set up. Terrance & Phillip are suddenly bewildered] Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years, gaming was simple: you pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps, we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you pay for incentives, you're rewarded!
Prince
Free"mium". The "mium" is Latin for "not really."
Minister
It's a simple cycle, a never-ending loop based on RPGs: Explore -> Collect -> Spend -> Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money.
Prince
It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun!
The Marsh house, evening. Randy and Sharon have Stan on the sofa
Randy
You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! [whips out a phone bill. Sharon's arms are crossed]
Stan
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I spent that much.
Randy
You didn't realize! What are "Canadian coins"?
Stan
You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
Randy
Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
Stan
I'll pay you back for it, okay?!
Randy
How?!
Stan
I don't know, I'll figure it out! Jesus Christ!
The master bedroom, later. Randy changes into red pajamas while Sharon is already in her white ones sipping some water.
Randy
Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter! [Sharon lies down] I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.
Sharon
Wull whattaya mean?
Randy
[faces Sharon] Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
Sharon
Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
Randy
I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.[dramatic exit music]
Back to the Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming.
Minister
And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles: entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-
Prince
So they'll forget they're spending money.
Minister
-and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.
Phillip
We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?
Minister
No no! It has to be just barely fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun. [the Prince gives Terrance and Phillip each a check.]
Terrance
What's this?
Prince
Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.
Terrance
So this is- Everyone is doing this?
Minister
Ehhhveryone is doing it.
Phillip
It's just the way things are going?
Minister
It's the way things are going!
Terrance
Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.
Stan's bedroom, day. Stan is playing the Terrance & Phillip mobile game in bed
Terrance
[in the game] Hey Phillip! [Stan's bedroom door opens and in walk Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman]
Stan
Ohhh hey guys.
Kyle
You... missed school today?
Stan
Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.
Kyle
Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
Stan
Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
Cartman
How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
Stan
Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. [smiles]
Kyle
You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
Stan
You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
Cartman
Yes.
Stan
It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
Kyle
Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
Cartman
Jimmy told me about this game.
Kyle
Kenny, who told you about this game?
Kenny
(Jimmy.)
Kyle
Dude, what?!
Cartman
The?!
Kenny
(Fuck?!)
A street corner in South Park, near a fast-food restaurant. Jimmy stands there with phone in hand. He spots someone.
Jimmy
Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here. [a boy crosses the street and stands next to him] Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?
Boy
What do you mean?
Jimmy
The Terrance & Phillip mobile game. [whips it out] All the cool kids are usin' it.
Boy
Aw, I don't know.
Jimmy
Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff. [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny appear at the other end of the block and spot him, then walk towards him a few seconds later] It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? [the boys reach him]
Kyle
Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
Jimmy
Why sure fellas. [the boy turns left and walks away] Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.
Kyle
[walks up to him] Dude, what are you doing?!
Jimmy
Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
Kyle
You need to stop recommending that app to people!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Cartman
Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
Jimmy
I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.
Cartman
It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
Kyle
[crosses his arms] Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
Jimmy
[on the spot] Alright, alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.
Kyle
You just push it on other people?!
Jimmy
They pay me to!
Kyle
Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!
The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. The Prince looks out over the new construction going on in the city, then turns around
Prince
You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game.
Terrance
Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.
Minister
Oh. Ah what is the matter?
Phillip
It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. [Terrance jumps up and farts on Phillip, who laughs.]
Prince
But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan.
Terrance
We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
Minister
Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that! [gasps] Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in "moderation"?
Prince
Ohhhhh. [claps furiously]
Phillip
Do you really think that would help?
Minister
Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!
Live commercial for alcohol. A montage of people enjoying alcohol and the good life that often accompanies it.
Announcer
You. Friends. Fun. Drink. Hot girls. You're hot. Drink more. Expensive cars. Ass, drink, ass, money, you in a tuxedo, threesomes, vodka, pussy, drink, drink, drink, you, drink, Vegas, fun, pussy, you, in a tuxedo, fucking this girl, vodka, drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy! MORE TUXEDOS, MORE CARS, MORE PUSSY, MORE VODKA, DRINK DRINK DRINK! [screen goes black with "Drink Responsibly" in white on it] Please drink responsibly.
Three Feathers Casino, day. The camera pans from left to right. Randy appears in the far end of the casino and walks to the right
Randy
Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go. [Stan catches up] That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine. [they approach Marvin] Come on Dad, we're going home.
Marvin
[playing at a 25 cent Lucky Unicorn slot machine] Ah, go away.
Randy
Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
Marvin
What are you talkin' about?
The Marsh house, some time later, day. Randy is pacing the floor in front of the sofa as Stan and Marvin sit and listen
Randy
I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
Stan
It's just...
Marvin
It's fun.
Stan
Yeah, it's fun.
Randy
It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
Marvin
Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
Randy
I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six! [walks up to a small buffet cabinet on which sit six different glasses of wine, from syrah to rosé] It's called a tasting, and it's classy![Marvin looks away]
Stan
Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
Marvin
[faces forward] Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop.
Randy
All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore. [gulps down the glass of Merlot] HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*
Jimmy's house. He stands by a window contemplating
Jimmy
Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman. [turns around and walks across the room] People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
Kyle
But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
Jimmy
How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
Cartman
[approaches Jimmy and grabs him by the shirt collar] And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
Jimmy
I needed the money, alright?! [Cartman releases him and he walks off a bit] I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!
Kyle
You have your crutches!
Jimmy
It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
Cartman
That makes sense.
Kyle
You're saying these games do this on purpose?!
Jimmy
[faces the boys] Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.
Stan's bedroom, night. He's awake in bed looking at the ceiling. The first notification comes in on his phone
Voice Notification
Hey, buddy. Come on, guy. [Stan turns to his left side and the notification disappears, but just as he closes his eyes another one follows.] Come back, friend. You've got new buddies, guy. [Stan takes his pillow and puts it over his head. The third notification comes in] We've just given you 5000 Canadian coins. [Stan quickly looks at his phone] Enjoy your Canadough.
Stan
...Free? [puts his pillow back on the mattress, grabs the phone and starts playing again]
The Marsh kitchen, day. Randy and Stan are in it
Randy
What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!
Stan
I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
Randy
$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
Stan
One?
Randy
Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
Stan
No, no, it's not.
Randy
You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
Stan
I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
Randy
I am not chugging beer! [walks up to the breakfast table on which are eight glasses of wine and eight of beer, paired up. He's gone through four pairs already] I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! [plops the fifth lager into the fifth wine glass and chugs down the pair, then blows a whistle while shaking his head with his hands. Stan has nothing to say.]
Kyle's house, day. Stan walks over to it and rings the doorbell. Kyle answers the door.
Stan
Okay, I need help. [sometime later Cartman, Kenny and Jimmy arrive, and Stan picks up where he left off. The conversation moves to the living room, and Kyle gives Stan a comforting tap on the right shoulder] There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
Jimmy
Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
Kyle
Sure. Come on, guys. [he, Cartman and Kyle walk away]
Jimmy
This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.
Stan
It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
Jimmy
I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.
Stan
How?
Jimmy
What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say "I have a problem." And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. [Stan is left deep in thought]
The Broflovski kitchen, at the same time. The other boys are in there waiting for Jimmy and Stan
Kyle
[brainstorming] We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
Cartman
It's done. [he had been texting on his phone]
Kyle
Wuh, what's done?
Cartman
The word is out. [shows him the phone] "Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts." I tweeted it. [glances at his phone's screen] It's trending.
The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. Terrance & Phillip burst through the doors again
Terrance
You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
Prince
You what?
Minister
Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game.
Phillip
But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
Terrance
You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!
Prince
Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?
Minister
Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games really work. [pulls down on the heavy rope again and new, prepared whiteboards come down over the used ones. The doors close and the room gets dim.] The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents.
Terrance
But then all our profits come from people with problems.
Minister
Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke.
Phillip
[snorts the bump] Okay, but we still won't stand for this!
Stan's room, night. He's kneeling by the side of his bed, looking up at the moon. Then he gets to prayer
Stan
I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? [a bright, fiery light appears behind him and he turns to look at it. Satan emerges from it]
Satan
You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?!
Stan
Whoa, shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
Satan
Then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul! [moments later he's on Stan's bed, the fiery light gone] So you got dopamine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopamine so that they want to consume and reproduce.
Stan
Okay.
Satan
But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff.
Stan
So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
Satan
Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopamine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life.
Stan
So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
Satan
Yeah, that's pretty much what it means.
Stan
The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
Satan
Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time?
Stan
Yeah, no, this is great.
Satan
Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec.
The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, day. The Minister continues with his lecture
Minister
Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers.
Phillip
Oh God, he just doesn't stop!
Terrance
Who IS this guy?!
Minister
We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're COUNTING on it!! It's the same with us, but we've got our eyes on every addict's screen! [the whiteboards begin to dissolve into the walls, with the words floating around independently]Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats!
Phillip
Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
Minister
Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil. [he transforms into a Canadian devil and floats up towards the ceiling] I'm the Canadian Devil. [laughs]
Terrance
Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!
Phillip
Beelzeboot!
Beelzeboot
You discovered my plan, but too late! [lets out a flaming turd] Now the souls of all Canadians belong to me!
Terrance
Oh no!
Prince
Oh, what have I done?!
Beelzeboot
Heheheh! Hahaha! [lets out a flaming turd]
Stan's room, night. Satan continues his talk with Stan, this time with a small whiteboard
Satan
So basically, the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with, um, dopamine regulation, and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff.[puts the whiteboard aside] Okay, so we kind of understand now, champ?
Stan
I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
Satan
You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too, so people have free will and all that shit. But ,you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay.
Voice Notification
*Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough?
Satan
What's this?
Stan
That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. [Satan taps the screen, stands up, and plays the game]
Satan
What, you just collect coins?
Announcer
How much money can you buy today?
Satan
No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?
Stan
Ah, Canada?
Satan
Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, "temptation has to be nuanced!" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?
Stan
...Okay. [Satan proceeds to possess Stan] Aaaaahhh!
The Marsh living room, moments later. Randy and Sharon are on the sofa. Randy wears a beer hat with two cans of gluten-free PBR attached to it, one by each ear
Randy
Oh pass interference! Interference! [points at the TV. Stan walks by]
Sharon
Stan, where are you going? [Randy looks over]
Stan
[with Satan's voice] I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. [continues out the door]
Randy
Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. [Sharon looks at him]
The Canadian Department of Mobile Gaming, under a fiery sky.
NC 9 Reporter
Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil.
Beelzeboot
[flies up to the microphone] Hey, guy, I'm the Canadian Devil. [lets out a flaming turd and flies back into the Department]
NC 9 Reporter
The Canadian Devil now has complete control of the soul of every Canadian. This is a sad day for Canada, and therefore, the world. [Beelzeboot goes to torture Terrance, Phillip, and the Prince, who now hang from chains tied to the ceiling]
Beelzeboot
Heh heheheh, I stab you. [Satan, now in Stan's body, appears outside the meeting room and blows the doors off, then walks in]
Satan
Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!
Phillip
Who the fuck is that?
Beelzeboot
Well well, my overachieving doppelganger! You're no match for Canadian Satan! [lets out a flaming turd]
Satan
Return from whence you came! [purple balls of energy appear around his hands, and they produce two beams of flame which carry Beelzeboot out into the sky]
Beelzeboot
Ow! Watch it, guy! [the battle continues in the sky]
NC 9 Reporter
Sadly, a shocking turn of events here as the actual Devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the Canadian Devil! This is certainly a conundrum for Canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for. For that, let's ask the Minister of Sports in Edmonton. [The Canadian Minister of Sports appears on split screen]
Minister of Sports
Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years.
Canadian
Screw that, go Canada!
Satan
Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come. [the balls of energy reappear and this time he aims the flames down at Beelzeboot. He destroys the Department in the meantime. Flaming skulls appear and go back into the pit Satan created]
The neighborhood park, day. Cartman, Kenny, and Kyle play basketball there when the ground next to them opens up and a bunch of red arms lift Stan out, repairing the court just before Stan lands on it.
Kyle
Hey dude.
Stan
Hey.
Kyle
Y-you alright?
Stan
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. [turns away and walks off the court]
Cartman
Cool.
Canada. There's a huge celebration, and the Prince steps up tp the podium
Prince
My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, shitty tundra. [cheers erupt from the crowd]
The Marsh dining room. Grandpa and Stan are playing a board game
Stan
I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
Marvin
Well okay, good idea. [Stan rolls the dice]
Randy
[stops by with an ornate silver cup] What are you gaywads doin'?
Stan
We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
Randy
Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. [takes a seat]
Stan
That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
Randy
It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
Stan
Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. [Marvin takes the dice and rolls them]
Randy
You guys wanna put some money on it? [Stan bangs his head on the table.]
End of Freemium Isn't Free

Grounded Vindaloop
South Park Elementary, day. Butters walks down the hallway wearing a fake Oculus headset. He stumbles along as if he's actually in virtual reality. He checks out the other kids, the floor, the surroundings...
Butters
WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there! [Craig turns to watch] I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa... [He and Stan bump into each other and Butters begins to run his hands over him] Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
Stan
[holding Butters off] Butters, what the hell are you doing?
Butters
I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
Cartman
[hidden around the corner, in front of the camera] That's awesome, Butters. [snickers away from the walkie-talkie] Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? [snickers away from the walkie-talkie]
Butters
More of the school. [Clyde talks to Bebe, who seen leaves]
Clyde
What are you doing, Butters?
Butters
The school and all the kids. [Clyde walks away] I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
Cartman
Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I- [mutes the walkie-talkie and whispers] He's so fucking stupid. [un-mutes it] But I'm sure they will soon.
Butters
[beginning to wobble] Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- [about to take off the fake headset,]
Cartman
[watching him from around the corner] Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
Butters
What what what?
Cartman
What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
Butters
[turns so that he's facing away from the camera] Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
Cartman
You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
Butters
I'm sorry!
Cartman
You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
Butters
Yeah.
Cartman
You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
Butters
[begins to run] Oh Jesus! [Cartman looks on from around the corner]
From school to home. Butters comes out the front doors and runs to the sidewalk. He looks both ways and runs off to his left. Next, Cartman's house is shown the Cartman's room. Butters makes it inside, where Cartman has put up fluorescent posters and accents
Butters
Okay, I'm back in your room!
Cartman
Alright Butters, sit down at the computer. [Butters does this] Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
Butters
[drops a shield over the glasses] Suppornity window dropped. [Cartman enters his room, locks the door and turns on the lights, then walks over to Butters and removes the fake headset. Butters wipes his eyes]
Cartman
Welcome back, dude.
Butters
Wow! That was cool!
Cartman
How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
Butters
I touched Wendy's boobs. [guess he feels okay.]
The cafeteria, lunchtime. Cartman is at table with Kyle, Token, Kenny, Stan, and Jimmy. Cartman is laughing his ass off, but soon gets back to his story
Cartman
And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, "Whoa, I'm back." [pounds his left fist on the table] Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
Stan
Sound pretty typical to me.
Cartman
Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
Kyle
Coup de grah, Cartman
Cartman
Thank you, Kyle.
Stan
Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
Cartman
Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
Butters
Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period? [in a knowing voice] Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? [chuckles]
Cartman
Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
Butters
You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said "Well, technically I was in school." Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
Cartman
Right Butters. [softly over his left shoulder] These guys are so dumb, huh?
Butters
Yeah. [runs off with his food tray]
Cartman
See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
Cartman's room, night. Butters is at the computer while Cartman holds the fake headset in hand
Cartman
Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
Butters
Well, not a hundred percent...
Cartman
Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. [hands him the headset and Butters puts it on.]
Butters
Okay, subject is ready.
Cartman
[picks up the walkie-talkie] Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now. [presses a few keys on the keyboard] Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
Butters
Interim status is go.
Cartman
[turns off the room light so the fluorescent lights stand out] Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, [raises the shield]Mark. [quickly hides in the closet as Butters gets accustomed to the headset again]
Butters
It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
Cartman
All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
Butters
Going now! [bumps into the door frame, then goes downstairs. A second or two later Cartman comes out of the closet, turns on the light, goes to his computer and sits on his chair]
Cartman
Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
Butters
Okay.
Stan's room, night. Stan is reading a book when he heats something outside. He sets the book aside and looks out his window. He sees Butters shoveling snow off people's driveways
Butters
How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
Cartman
You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
Butters
Okay. It's so realistic. [a shot of Stan watching from across the street.] The snow looks kind of fake though. [Stan leaves the window] Alright, I think that's all of it.
Cartman
Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
Butters
[rings the doorbell. A middle-aged woman answers the door with a dollar bill in her hand] There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
Cartman
Just take the money, Butters! [Butters reaches for the bill and takes it.]
Butters
Okay, I got it!
Cartman
You got the money? [Butters walks down the walkway as the lady closes the front door] Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
Butters
Already? Oh no!
Cartman
Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back. [eats some more chips] Are you heading back Butters? [no reply.] Butters? [Butters goes home] Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
Butters
I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. [goes inside, leaving the front door open]
Stephen
There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!
Butters
Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!
Stephen
I know that! What do you-?
Butters
This is for all the times I got grounded! [Make a fist and fires it at Stephen's groin. Stephen doubles over in pain]
Stephen
Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!
Butters
HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist! [at the other end of the call, Cartman is shocked] Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
Linda
Butters, why?? Oh my God!
Butters
Huh, that was incredible!
Cartman
[getting worried] Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
Butters
I feel amazing! [giggles] I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?! [starts throwing rocks] Eh take that, you stupid cars! [a hit car screeches to a halt]
Driver
[steps out of the car] What the hell are you doing, Kid?!
Cartman
Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
Butters
[knocks the driver out of the car] Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
Driver
Hey! [Butters peels away]
Butters
Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
Cartman
Oh shit! [runs outside] Butters! Butters, where are you now?
Butters
Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
Cartman
Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
Butters
I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
Cartman
Wait, hang on Butters!
Butters
Take that, you dumb hooker!
Hooker
What you doin' motherfucker?!
Butters
I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
Cartman
Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
Butters
I can't [wheeze] I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
Cartman
Butters?? Butters?? [turns the walkie-talkie off]
Hell's Pass Hospital, now bigger, with two new wings and four floors. Moon shadows appear on the facade. Butters is in a room with a doctor and a nurse
Dr. Carroll
You're very lucky, young man. You've got a couple of hairline fractures, but the knife missed your spleen by half an inch.
Butters
I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
Dr. Carroll
No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine.
Butters
Aw nuts!
Dr. Carroll
Try and relax, and when your parents get here we'll sort this all out. [the doctor and nurse leave. The nurse turns off the light]
Butters
I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
Cartman
Butters. [Butters looks to his right. Dramatic camera pan from Butters to Cartman, who stands on the window sill like Morpheus]
Butters
Ahhh!
Cartman
Are you okay?
Butters
Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
Cartman
I'm not here, Butters.
Butters
What?
Cartman
This is going to be hard to understand, Butters, [climbs down to the floor] but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this... [spreads his arms out] is real.
Butters
[looks around skeptically] Nuh uh!
Cartman
Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. [pulls off the missing thumb trick.]
Butters
WHAT?? [Cartman puts on a couple of thumb lights and clicks them on and off in alternate order.]
Cartman
You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. [pulls out a wand from his sleeve and produces a bouquet of flowers from it]
Butters
[now on edge] Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!
Cartman
Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
Butters
Ah how do you know that?!
Cartman
[pressing a buzzer] How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? [hides under the bed]
Nurse
Everything okay in here?
Butters
Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
Nurse
O-kay. [turns around and walks out. Cartman comes out from the window side of the bed]
Cartman
Butters.
Butters
NO!
Cartman
I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! [performs another trick in which he gets a coin inside a glass bottle... and succeeds]
Butters
[thoroughly scared, shuts his eyes] AAAAAAHAHAH! [he opens them moments later and Cartman is gone.]
The bus stop, next day. The four boys await the bus. Kyle is angry at Cartman
Kyle
Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
Cartman
I'm happy that I totally got away with it. [gets a call] What's a 911 area code? Hello?
Steve
Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.
Cartman
With what?
Steve
This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
Cartman
[slowly] Fuck you!
Steve
I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.
Kyle
You should probably listen to him, dude.
Cartman
Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
Steve
The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.
Cartman
Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
Kyle
[glances at Stan and Kenny] Maybe we are.
Cartman
[sighs and squeezes his eyes shut for a moment] Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
Steve
I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.
Cartman
Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! [Well...]
Cartman's room, day. Liane has prepared a glazed burger for Cartman and takes it to his room. She knocks on his door.
Liane
Eric? Poopsiekins? [hearing no reply, she opens his door and goes in] Eric? [Steve was right. Cartman is at his computer wearing the Oculus headset, in a coma-like trance] Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now. [Cartman's left foot twitches] I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat? [this time Cartman moves his whole body] All right, I'll just leave it here, hon. [sets the burger next to the computer] I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.[exits and closes the door]
Butters' house, next day.
Stephen
What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!
Butters
Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
Stephen
Oh no, mister! You are GROUNDED! [Butters recoils and Stephen slams the door shut. Butters turns around and goes to sit on the floor beside his bed. The door opens and Cartman enters]
Cartman
Are you fucking with me?!
Butters
...What? What do you mean?
Cartman
Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
Butters
I don't know what you mean.
Cartman
Because if you are, it's not cool!
Butters
Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
Cartman
Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
Butters
Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.
Cartman
Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
Butters
Oh gosh!
Cartman
That's right!
Butters
OH GOSH!
Cartman
THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
Butters
Yeah.
Cartman
Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! [Butters is alarmed]
The neighborhood park, day. Stan and Kyle are playing tether-ball near the restrooms. Kyle's phone rings
Kyle
[answers] Hello?
Butters
Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!
Kyle
Again?
Butters
No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
Kyle
Uh huh.
Butters
I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
Kyle
Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
Butters
PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
Stephen
Butters?! Who is that?!
Butters
Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- [Kyle looks concerned and hangs up]
Kenny
[runs up to Stan and Kyle, panicked] (You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!)
Cartman's room. Kenny leads Stan and Kyle inside over to Cartman, who is still passed out wearing the Oculus headset
Kenny
(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
Kyle
You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Kyle
[slowly] Fuck you!
Kenny
[taken aback] (What??)
Kyle
Get up, Cartman!
Kenny
[angry] (This isn't a prank, Kyle!)
Kyle
Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso! [shakes Cartman's chair] You're goin' to the hospital!
Stan
Kyle, maybe this is for real.
Kyle
[looks back at Stan, then turns around to face him] Fuck you if you're in on this.
Stan
In on what? [thinks a moment...] Ohh, [slowly] Fuck you!
The customer service center in India
Steve
Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares. [listens to the response] That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service. [clicks to the next caller] El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve.
Kyle
Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
Steve
Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend. [clicks again] Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve.
Kyle
Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
Steve
Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?
Kyle
Kyle.
Steve
Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
Kyle
I don't care!
Steve
He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.
Kyle
You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
Steve
Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
Kyle
[rolls his eyes, then slowly] Fuck you!
Stan
"Fuck you" what?
Kyle
He said they're doing a Total Recall.
Stan
Oh fuck you!
Steve
All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?
Kyle
You haven't done anything yet!
Steve
But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
Kyle
We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
Steve
Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend? [Kyle looks at his phone, then at the user's manual]
South Park, morning. A signal interrupts the scenery twice, but is quickly gone
Cartman's house, living room. Cartman is pacing the living room trying to calm himself
Cartman
It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. [the doorbell rings and he answers. It's Kyle.]
Kyle
Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
Cartman
I know. Let's go to the backyard. [turns and walks to the backyard. Kyle is quite surprised by Cartman's reaction. Moments later they takes seats at the picnic table out back. A butterfly floats by]
Kyle
Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
Cartman
Okay Kyle.
Kyle
Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
Cartman
Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
Kyle
Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
Cartman
[laces his fingers together, with his index fingers making a steeple in front of his lips] Mmmhmm.
Kyle
I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
Cartman
And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
Kyle
Www-what do you mean?
Cartman
Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
Kyle
Fuck you!
Cartman
I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
Kyle
Don't... do that!
Cartman
Calm down.
Kyle
NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
Cartman
In virtual reality, yes you did.
Kyle
No. Then I came into this virtual space.
Cartman
You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
Kyle
Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
Cartman
[defeated] Fuck!
Best Buy, day. A Best Buy rep answers a phone
Best Buy Rep
Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call?
Kyle
Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
Cartman
Or if I did?
Kyle
Or if you sold one to an "Eric Cartman"?
Best Buy Rep
Sir, I'm gonna have to connect you to Customer Service. Hang on a sec. [transfers the call and hangs up. The call now reaches ... Steve!]
Steve
Best Buy Customer Service, this is Steve.
Kyle
[stunned at the familiar voice] Dude... What?
Cartman
What? [takes the phone from Kyle] Hello?
Steve
Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future.
Cartman
Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
The Stotch house, night. Stephen and Linda sit down for dinner
Stephen
[loudly] Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What what did he do?
Linda
Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.
Stephen
It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he is grounded. [hears something upstairs] And no bouncing the racquetball either!
Cartman's room. Stan and Kenny are the only two in the room, and Kenny's wearing the Oculus Rift. Stan is talking to Customer Service
Stan
No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! [the door opens and Cartman and Kyle walk in]
Kyle
Wait. Stan? [walks up to Stan] Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
Stan
It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
Kyle
Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
Stan
No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
Kyle
Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
Cartman
[still lost] No, you guys. This is virtual reality.
Stan
How do you know?
Cartman
Because... I'm a computer program.
Kyle
God damn it Cartman!
Cartman
I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
Kyle
He's lying.
Cartman
I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
Stan
What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
Steve
Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!
Stan
Butters called Customer Service first?
Steve
Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?
Stan
Come on, we're going to Butters' house! [they leave Kenny behind]
Steve
Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service.
Steve talks to himself
Steve
Hello, Customer Service, this is Steve.
Steve
Hello, this is Steve with Customer Service.
Steve
Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service.
Steve
Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real.
Steve
...Ohhh, nohhh, nonononononono.
Steve
My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.
Steve
[slowly, wagging his left index finger] Ohhh, fuck you!
Steve
Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?
Steve
What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!
Steve
Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!
Steve
But you didn't answer any of my questions!
Steve
Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?
Butters' room, day. He sits on the floor by his bed playing a child's xylophone. The curtains are drawn, but leave a small gap through which the sun shines in
Butters
[singing a spiritual] I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. [his door opens and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come in]
Stan
Butters.
Butters
[startled] Huh. But... [stands up] you guys can't be here.
Kyle
Why not?
Butters
Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
Kyle
Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
Butters
When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember? [goes to the bedroom door] We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
Stan
So now we are in th real world.
Butters
YES.
Cartman
You guys! [the boys look at him] I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
Stephen
[appears behind him] Butters!
Butters
[really startled] AAaaghagh!
Stephen
What are your friends doing here?!
Butters
Huh I'm sorry Dad!
Steve
Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?
Stan
Yes, we're here.
Steve
Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems.
Stephen
You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!
Stan
[as Stephen chews Butters out, puts some distance between them and himself] Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
Steve
That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!
Stan
What?! [Stephen unbuckles his belt, Butters holds a hand up]
Steve
Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
Stan
That doesn't make sense! [Stephen takes his belt off. Butters closes his eyes, knowing what's coming]
Steve
That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded! [the boys look at Stephen and Butters as Stephen prepares his belt for a whipping]
Stephen
Well you're getting it now!
Stan
Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!! [Stephen disappears, then Butters, then Kyle, then Cartman] You guys? Are you there?
Kyle
[from a walkie-talkie] We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
Stan
Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. [leaves Butters' room. Stephen and Linda never really left the dining room table/ Stephen senses a change in mood]
Stephen
Oh my gosh! Linda!
Linda
What is it, Stephen?
Stephen
It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore.
Linda
He's not?
Stephen
No. I've I've got to tell him! [leaves his chair and runs up to Butters' room] Butter? Butters! [Butters is on his bed, with the curtains open, asleep]
Butters
[wakes up] Ahhh, huh?
Stephen
You can go outside and play, son.
Butters
You... you, you mean ih... [sits up] I'm not grounded?
Stephen
No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over.
Butters
They did it! [hops off his bed] They figured it out! [heads out the door] Whoopie!
Cartman's house, later. Stan walks up to the house
Stan
Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
Kyle
We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
Stan
[goes upstairs and enters Cartman's room] Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.
Cartman
Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. [Stan does this]
Kyle
Alright, dude, take off the headset. [Stan reaches up and removes the headset. At this point the animation switches to live-action. Stan finishes taking off the headset as Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny watch]
Kyle
Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
Stan
[thoughtfully looking at the headset] It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.
Credits start rolling but after few credits roll there is shot back at Stan's room
Butters
[hops in like a bunny] Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore.
End of Grounded Vindaloop

Cock Magic
South Park Elementary hallway, day. The students are going about their business when several girls arrive with fliers in hand.
Girl 1
[handing out fliers] Hey guys. [Clyde takes one] Thanks. Support your team? Thank you. Hey guys. Did you get one of these? [walks up to Cartman and Craig] Hope you can make it.
Cartman
[takes a flier] What's this?
Girl 1
The girls' volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on.
Cartman
[looks at Craig.] Girls volleyball? [they both laugh at the thought] Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.
Girl 2
What's wrong with supporting girls' athletics?!
Cartman
Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay? [hands the flier back to girl 1] All right.
Girl 3
[walks up to Stan, Kyle, and Kenny] You know, we're actually in the playoffs, and all we keep hearing is "We're too busy."
Kyle
But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
Girl 3
What fight?
Stan
Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls' volleyball. [he, Kenny, and Kyle laugh]
Cartman
Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
A shop in South Park. A board on the sidewalk says "Magic the Gathering Tournament Today." Inside, Kenny and a heavy-set player, Slaughterhouse, are sat at a table already playing against each other, The player shuffles his cards around looking for the best ones to play
Slaughterhouse
Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my Elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on.
Kyle
Can Kenny block his Elderbeast?
Stan
Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
Cartman
This asshole needs to make a move already!
Referee
Quiet in the peanut gallery, please.
Slaughterhouse
I am attacking, but with a newly summoned Spark Ghast who has Trample. Four damage to your planeswalker.
Boys
Ohhhh!
Butters
Oh no! Kenny!
Stan
Shhh!
Butters
But he's dying! [Kenny lays down a card]
Stan
What's that?
Cartman
He's playing an enchantment.
Stan
This late?
Kyle
He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
Slaughterhouse
I can block that with Uprooted Minotaur. [Kenny lays down his next card]
Boys
Ohhhh!
Referee
Serendib Sorcerer unblocked. Winner: McCormick!
Boys
Yeeahhh!
Slaughterhouse
Nnoohhh!
South Park Elementary, day. Cartman recounts the previous day's events to the kids in the hallway. In the distance, a new janitor listens in while mopping the floor
Cartman
Dude, it was complete brutality!
Kyle
You've never seen anything so ruthless!
Stan
It was seriously almost hard to watch. [Wendy appears in the distance and walks over to the boys]
Cartman
At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
Stan
[sees Wendy] Wendy, did you hear about last night?
Wendy
Yeah, I heard the girls' volleyball team won by like 20 points.
Stan
Not that. Did you actually go to that?
Wendy
Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
Stan
Pfft, whatever.
Cartman
Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this! [the janitor finally looks at the group] It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
Janitor
Hey! Pssst! [the boys see him] Come over here. [the boys walk over to him while the other kids disperse] You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?
Cartman
Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
Janitor
Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit.
Stan
We're men.
Janitor
Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here. [hands them a sheet of paper with an address on it, and Kyle steps forward to take it] This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet. [turns right and leaves] And you might wanna pack a barf bag.
Cartman
[steps forward and watches him leave] Kewwwl!
South Park After Dark. The boys walk to a familiar place.
Kyle
Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
Cartman
What's hardcore and exciting about Shitty shrimp? [they approach the doors]
Kyle
It doesn't even look like they're open. [tugs and knocks at the doors]
Mr. Tuong
[unlocks the doors and answers them] We crosed! We crosed for the night! Go away prease! [waves them away]
Stan
Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?
Mr. Lu Kim
You purice?
Kenny
(What?)
Cartman
Dude, do we look like police?
Mr. Lu Kim
Okay, come on, come on, five dorrah, five dorrah each! Come on, five dorrah!
Cartman
Five dorrah?! [Mr. Lu Kim hushes them quickly and leads them to the back room, which leads to the basement. Lu Kim opens the basement door]
Mr. Lu Kim
You go down! Go down, find seat! We in sixth fight! Gogogogogogogo! [the kids go in, then Mr. Tuong, who closes the door behind him.]
City Wok basement. Lots of activity going on down there. Two roosters are set to fight each other with cards. The boys make it to ringside. An announcers calls the play-by-play
Announcer
Scrambles plays a Black Swamp mana card. Fluffy counters with a mana card of his own. And he plays a Fugitive Wizard!
Crowd
Ooooooo.
Announcer
More mana from Scrambles! And yes, that is Crippling Blight! Crippling Blight to the Fugitive Wizard! Creature now has -1 to strength and defense! More Mana from Fluffy. Now he'll attack with Fugitive Wizard, and there's an instant attack from Scrambles! That is Peel from Reality! Fugitive Wizard is literally torn apart from the battleground!
The boys
Whoa!
Announcer
The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It's Mass Calcify against Into the Void!
M Burger, next day. The boys are eating
Cartman
Dude, that was total carnage!
Stan
That was freakin' hardcore.
Cartman
Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
Stan
It was just decimation.
Kyle
It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
Cartman
We're going again on Friday, right?
Stan
Hell yeah! [Kenny lowers his head, and Cartman notices]
Cartman
What's the matter Kenny?
Kenny
(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
Stan
What's mean about it?
Kenny
[mumbles]
Cartman
You feel bad for the roosters?
Kenny
(Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.)
Stan
Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
Kyle
Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
Cartman
Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
Kenny
(No.)
Cartman
Huh? A little bit?
Kenny
(NO.)
Stan
Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
Kyle
Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
Cartman
What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. [Kenny just looks at his meal]
The McCormick house, day. Two officers stand at the landing as one of them knocks
Det. Harris
Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?
Stuart
What do you mean?
Det. Harris
Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it.
Stuart
What's cock Magic?
Det. Harris
Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play "Magic: the Gathering," and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?
Stuart
I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
Det. Harris
Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong, and anyone I find involved with this filth is goin' down!
The Marsh house, day. The boys are on the sofa and Randy is lecturing them on Magic: the Gathering. Or on cock Magic.
Randy
Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
Stan
Dad, it's not that big a deal.
Randy
It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
Kyle
You were?
Randy
Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. [whips out a handkerchief, and drums begin to play. Randy places the hankey over his pants and begins a demonstration of cock magic, as he knew it]
Randy's cock magic. It moves left, then right quickly. Then it pops up from behind the hankey, then pops under
Stan
Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.
Randy
Oh? Not impressed? How about this? [makes his penis pop out right, left, down... up, left. Stan hides his face in his hand while his friends are speechless]
A run-down house, much like Kenny's, day. The boys approach it and ring the buzzer. This place has an intercom
Voice
What is it?!
Cartman
Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"?
Voice
Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters.
Kyle
Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.
Breeder
[The voice, opens up and lets them in] Come on to the back, don't mind the smell. [he takes the boys to his barn and shows them around] We only deal in the highest quality poultry Planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed?
Kyle
We don't... really know the difference.
Breeder
Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks.
Stan
Do you think they're happy?
Breeder
Do I think they're happy?
Stan
Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?
Breeder
[thinks a moment] They're fuckin' chickens.
Cartman
Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
Breeder
Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.
Cartman
Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny?
Stan
[off-screen] Hey, how about this little guy?
Breeder
That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers.
Kyle
Then he's perfect for us.
Cartman
What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?
Kyle
Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
Cartman
[mimicking a rooster] "Yes I do, you guys." [normally] Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
The Marsh house, day. Sharon is in the master bedroom folding clothes when Shelly appears
Shelly
Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour!
The Marsh bathroom, moments later. A drummer is heard inside
Sharon
Randy?
Randy
[lounge voice] Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!
Sharon
[Sharon pounds on the door] Randy, what are you doing?!
Randy
Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind. [back to the lounge voice] Hey!
Sharon
Randy, why are there drums playing? [the drums stop and Randy opens the door]
Randy
All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
Sharon
Ohhh, no no nononononono no.
Randy
Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
Sharon
I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
Randy
Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
Sharon
Stanley??
Randy
People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh! [a hankey drapes his erect penis] Oh my gosh! [pulls the hankey off and the penis is back in his pants. He smiles, she walks away, his smile fades, and he goes back into the bathroom and shuts the door]
City Wok, Friday night. Tonight, it's McNuggets against a different rooster.
Announcer
Reuben casts Silklash Spider. Silklash Spider can block as if it had Flying! And now he casts Geistflame, dealing one damage to McNuggets.
Cartman
[through gritted teeth] Come on, McNuggets! Fight!
Kyle
You can do it, McNuggets! [the crowd argues around them]
Announcer
Quiet, please.
Someone
I think I'll bet on the next one.
Announcer
Waaiitt! [the crowd gets quiet] McNuggets has cast Punishing Fire, absorbing the Geistflame and dealing two damage to the opponent! Game, set and match, McNuggets!
Crowd
Whoa!
Stan
Yeah!
Cartman
All right, McNuggets!
Kyle
All right, McNuggets! [after the fights the boys leave City Wok] Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
Cartman
[carrying McNuggets in a small cage] That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular "Magic: The Gathering" look like girls' volleyball.
Promoter
[comes out behind the boys with two bodyguards] Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock.
Cartman
Thank you so very much.
Promoter
I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?
Kyle
You mean there's more to this?
Promoter
Oh, yes. And I'm not talking about the basement of some seedy Chinese restaurant, I'm talking about the basement of a well-established Chinese franchise. Saturday night, here's the address. [again Kyle takes the slip of paper] Let's see what kind of money your cock can really make.
Stan
Gee, thanks!
Cartman
You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
A girl's sixth birthday party, back yard. Lots of kids running around and making noise. A bounce house is off to one corner
Woman
Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.
Kindergarten boy
Yay, a show, a show!
Woman
Do you kids like magic?
Kindergartners
Yeah, yay!
Woman
Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randy! [leaves as Randy enters, and the kids cheer]
Randy
Hey kids, are we having fun? [places his hat over his groin, then reaches for it on his head] Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? [no reaction from the kids. Inside, the parents are preparing the cake]
Woman
[mixing some lemonade] Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.
Randy
[with his penis in a box and a saw in his left hand] Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic... [begins to saw through the box] you'll find that- [the saw hits something that produces gushes of blood. All the kids are hit and they panic] Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!
Man
[chuckles] They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?
Randy
Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?! [the girl reaches behind her ear and pulls out a detached penis. She screams and Randy takes it from her.] Oh, it was behind her ear. [goes back to the stage and pops it right back where it should be, hidden so the kids don't see what he's actually doing] And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randy! Thank you! [kids are still screaming]
Kindergarten boy
I hate you!
South Park Elementary, day. Stan recounts the events of the night before
Stan
Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
Kyle
It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
Craig
Where was all this?
Cartman
We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
Kyle
Yeah, you gotta know people.
Butters
Dangit, I wish I knew people.
Mr. Garrison
All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls' volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. [goes to his desk as she enters]
Coach
Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout.
Cartman
Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
Butters
[chuckling] Yeah.
Coach
You know, when you put your all into something, it's kind of a bummer when people don't seem to care. [focus on Kenny, who looks down] Kind of makes you feel like the sport you love is becoming a joke.
Stan
Dude, girls' volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
Cartman
OOHHH!! [laughs with the other boys]
Jimmy
Fantastic girls' volleyball joke, Stan.
Coach
The girls wanted to say something, so we're now going to hear a few words from the captain of the girls' volleyball team.
Wendy
[gets up and goes to the front of the class. Stan is immediately stunned] Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. [goes back to her seat]
Cartman
[aside, to Stan] Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
The girl's birthday party. SPPD show up. The father explains to Det. Harris what happened. Other office inspect the backyard for evidence
Man
And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh.
Det. Harris
Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that? [the man and wife look at each other]
Man
Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there.
Det. Harris
Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?
Woman
Decks??
Man
Who? There weren't any "decks."
Det. Harris
Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?
Woman
[in tears] I'm so confused, babe.
Det. Harris
Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
Man
Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!
Det. Harris
Agreed! Who first called 911? [moments later the woman is being taken to a squad car as the man and their daughter look on]
Woman
Please! Don't take me away from my child!
Girl
[crying] Mommy!
South Park, Saturday night. Kyle, Cartman and Kenny reach the site of the next cock Magic fight. Stan is not present
Kyle
This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
Cartman
Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. [they stand before Panda Express. Again, Kyle knocks on the doors and tugs at them.]
Manager
[opens the door] Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!
Cartman
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
Manager
Oh okay, come on, ten dorrah, ten dorrah.
Cartman
Ten dorrah?! [the boys hand over $10 each]
Panda Express basement, moments later
Announcer 2
For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky.
Cartman
Who is that??
Spectator 1
That's Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. [Gadnuk is wearing a gold medallion] He's never lost a fight. Hell, he's never even lost one health!
South Park Elementary gym, night. The girls are playing a visiting group, and Stan is there to watch the game. Wendy, #4 serves. #36 on the other side hits it up, with #11 hitting it back over the net. #1 on Wendy's side hits it up, then #36 hits it, then #8 hits it over the net
Stan
[following the cock Magic fight over the phone] What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
Cartman
Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
Kyle
McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
Cartman
McNuggets is scared, dude!
Stan
Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
Wendy serves, and #58 on the other side hits it up, then #8 hits it, then #22 hits it back over the net
Spectator 2
[returns to the crowd with a dead bird] He didn't stand a chance. Not one spell cast before he was obliterated by health drains! That thing isn't human! [walks away with his rooster. Gadnuk throws down a card. The promoter walks up]
Promoter
Alright, your rooster's up next, boys.
Kyle
Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
Promoter
He doesn't have a choice.
Cartman
This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
Promoter
What do you think all these people are here to see?
Cartman
Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
Promoter
The hell you do! Get your cock in there! [Kenny sighs and goes in instead]
ESPN Illegal is shown on a monitor
ESPN Announcer
You're watching ESPN Illegal, your source for bullfighting, dogfighting, and cock Magic.
ESPN Host
And a warm welcome back to the Cock Magic Championships. Certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of Panda Express. The fight we were expecting, of course, Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds versus ten-month-old Cornish rooster McNuggets. In a complete shocker, the challenger McNuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old Kenny McCormick. Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock Magic. Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move. [Gadnuk ponders what to do while Kenny slowly taps his fingers on the table, waiting] Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds plays a creature card. [his assistant places it on the table]
Cartman
Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
Crowd
Whooaa.
Kyle
Come on, Kenny! [Kenny take a card from a deck and looks through his other cards]
South Park Elementary gym, the game there continues. #11 hits it over the net to Wendy's side. #1 hits it... Stan is still following the cock Magic fights
Stan
What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
Cartman
Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
Kyle
He just had to shuffle it.
Cartman
Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an Overseer.
Stan
Does an Overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! [meanwhile, the ball goes to #36, who hits it back over the net]
ESPN Host
A second Elvish Mystic now, and Gadnuk attacks with Merciful Pretender. McCormick sends Charging Rhino to the graveyard. He's desperate now. Not too much he can-OH, and he's just laid down Life's Legacy!
Crowd
Ooooohh...
ESPN Host
That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!
Kyle
Holy shit, dude!
ESPN Host
Gadnuk tries to block with Living Totem but OH, there is Terra Stomper! This is absolute savagery! Frenzied Goblin has been sent to the graveyard and now there is no one to block Pearl Lake Ancient! My God, someone has to put a stop to this!
Det. Harris
Freeze! [comes down to the basement with reinforcements. The cops draw their guns and check everyone out there. One cop pulls a gun from a spectator's jacket and throws it to the ground] Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time! [looks at Kenny] Especially you, scumbag!
Promoter
Lousy cops! How did you find us?
Det. Harris
We saw your fliers. [holds one up] "Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm."
Promoter
We didn't put those fliers out!
Announcer
[spotlights come on and move out over the crowd] And now, for your halftime entertainment, please welcome... the incomparable, the beautiful, the Amazingly Randy! [A stage is lit up and Randy bounds out]
Cartman
Ah, dude, your dad's here.
Randy
[lounge voice] Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing. [dances over to a stool nearby with a box sitting on it] Whatever you believe is real, is real. [pulls out a hankey, then goes back to center stage and shows there's nothing odd about it. He unzips his zipper and puts the hankey on his penis. He gets a rubber band and ties the hankey around the penis. Next he moves his hand around and his penis rises in response, as if his hands had some magnetic power to them. Suddenly, the penis takes flight and goes around several times. He holds up a large ring and the penis flies through it flawlessly. He turns around and the song "Barbie Girl" plays. He drops his pants, dances a bit, then turns around with a small curtain over his legs. The penis peaks out to the right, up, left, and then the head of René Dif appears popping out to the right]
René Dif
Come on Barbie, let's go party.

[Randy pushes it gently behind the curtain again, then he squats just long enough to get his pants back up and remove the curtain. Then he hops around. He hops back to the stool and gets some body lotion to lubricate his penis with. Then he pretends to stroke his penis and a bouquet of flowers pops up. He tosses the bouquet into the crowd and a woman catches it]
Spectator 3
Ewww! [throws the bouquet away]
Randy
Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
Det. Harris
I'll volunteer.
Randy
Alright, come on up here. [Harris goes up] What's your name?
Det. Harris
I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police.
Randy
All right, a hand for Detective Harris! [applause. This provides a distraction by which some spectators leave silently] You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals. [grabs a tank of liquid nitrogen] Sir? [gives it to Harris, who holds it. Drumroll. Randy takes a funnel and puts one end on his penis, then motions for Harris to pour the nitrogen into the funnel. A few seconds later, the funnel comes off to reveal a frozen penis. Randy takes a gun out and shoots it to bits. Harris is stunned. Randy walks over to him and smiles. All of a sudden, the penis comes out of Harris' mouth. Randy take it and puts it into his pants. Harris smiles. Only four cops remain and they clap. The crowd and the other cops have left.]
South Park Elementary, day.
Cartman
It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
Butters
Wow, the cops came?
Kyle
Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
Cartman
Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
Kenny
(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
Kyle
Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
Stan
Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
Kyle
Got what?
Stan
A way to finally do something good for other people.
South Park Elementary gym, night. The girls volleyball team faces off against McNuggets. Wendy is about to serve when she looks at Stan, who gives her a thumbs up. Wendy shoots him a glare of disapproval over the whole idea.
Announcer
South Park serves, and McNuggets plays a Plains Land card. One-nil, South Park. [a smattering of applause. Wendy serves again] Another serve, and McNuggets summons Downtreader Elk. One South Park player is eliminated. You, the girl with the ponytails - you are dead.
End of Cock Magic

REHASH
Kyle's house, day. Kyle runs home excitedly with something in his hand. He opens the front door and goes in. Gerald spots him
Gerald
There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
Kyle
Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
Gerald
It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
Kyle
Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
Gerald
All right. [Kyle smiles, Gerald heads back to the kitchen] I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
Kyle
Yes! [runs upstairs smiling.]
Ike's room. Ike is at his computer eating Cheetos. Kyle knocks, then goes into the room
Kyle
Heeey Ike! Look what I got. [Ike looks over his shoulder] The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
PewDiePie
[on the monitor] Aww, look at all the bright colors.
Ike
...Meh. [goes back to watching the monitor and eating his Cheetos]
Kyle
Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
Ike
Maybe later, 'kay?
Kyle
[walks up to Ike] Well what are you watching?
PewDiePie
How's it goin' bros? My name's PewDiePie. I'm playing Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Here we go. [breaks through a door and is met with gunfire] Agh! People are shooting at me, bros!
Kyle
You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
Ike
[claps] PewDiePie!
PewDiePie
There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN!
Kyle
Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
PewDiePie
All right, I hope that's enough.
Ike
Meh.
PewDiePie
Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig! [fires away at will]
South Park Elementary Cafeteria, lunchtime
Kyle
Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
Butters
What's a PewDiePie do?
Kyle
Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
Cartman
He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
Kyle
Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
Commercial for an upcoming concert
Announcer
This Saturday, at the Pepsi Center, it's Women of Rock! Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea, Nicki Minaj, and Lorde! [Randy] All on one stage, on one night! With a special appearance by Michael Jackson's Hologram!
MJ Hologram
Hee hee!
Announcer
Ticket proceeds help fight the gluten crisis in West Africa! It's a night of pure, pure estrogen! Tickets on sale now! [TeleChargeIt and TicketMastering info go up]
Randy's garage, night. Randy runs inside to call someone in private
Randy
Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
Record Executive
Come on, this is a great lineup.
Randy
Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
Record Executive
I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
Randy
What is that supposed to mean?
Record Executive
I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
Randy
Yes, Freemium gaming.
Record Executive
I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush. [Randy sighs] You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over. [hangs up. Randy ends the call]
Randy
I love Candy Crush.
The bus stop, day. The boys are there waiting for the bus
Kyle
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Stan
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Kyle
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
Kenny
(Commentary?)
Kyle
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! [Cartman eyes his phone with Stan and Kenny look at Kyle]
Cartman's room, later. He's set up a YouTube channel and is now broadcasting on it
Cartman
Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. [a recording of the earlier conversation plays]
Kyle
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Cartman
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
Stan
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Cartman
[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
Kyle
I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
Kenny
(Commentary?)
Cartman
There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
Kyle
Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
The Marsh house, kitchen. Sharon is washing, Randy is drying, Shelly walks in excitedly
Shelly
Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! [anxiously waits for an answer]
Sharon
I don't know, Shelly.
Shelly
But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! [Randy and Sharon turn around]
Randy
Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
Shelly
She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!
Randy
And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
Shelly
That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything!
Randy
You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
Shelly
So can I go or not?!
Randy
If she means that much to you.
Shelly
Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. [smiles and walks away]
Sharon
Sooo you're doing it? [smiles]
Randy
How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
Sharon
Of course not. [Randy walks away and out of earshot] Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
Ike's room, later. Ike is still at his computer eating Cheetos
Cartman
Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.
Kyle
[goes into the room] Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
Cartman
More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
Kyle
Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
Kyle
All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
Cartman
That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
Kyle
[approaches the monitor] What the fuck?!
Stan
I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
Cartman
[reaches for some chips and eat them, chuckles, then] Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
Kyle
Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
Cartman
God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!
Kyle
But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
Ike
CartmaaanBrah!
The neighborhood park, basketball court, day. Cartman, Stan, and Kenny are playing a game. Cartman has the ball. Kyle runs up, angry
Kyle
What do you think you're doing?!
Cartman
Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
Kyle
You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
Cartman
I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
Kyle
I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
Stan
What are you talking about?
Kyle
This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
Cartman
Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
Kyle
Let's Plays?
Cartman
That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. [turns to the basket and takes his shot. Kyle looks away and down]
The Women of Rock concert at the Pepsi Center, night. Miley Cyrus is performing
Miley Cyrus
There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
Throw my hands in the air while I'm twerkin' this chair
There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
And I'm movin' my hands while I'm shakin' my tits.

Stagehand
Alright guys, Uh, Miley's about to finish up her set. So next we'll need you, Nicki Minaj, then Iggy Azalea who'll be performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson, and then finally you, Lorde. [walks out of the dressing room backwards] Have a great show, ladies.
Randy
Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
Record Executive
You're nervous, it's understandable.
Randy
No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
Record Executive
You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit.
Randy
Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
Iggy
Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!
Randy
No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
Iggy
That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!
Randy
Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
Iggy
'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse!
Randy
Fuck you! [they start fighting and break through a table full of finger good and drinks]
Record Executive
Alright that's enough! [breaks up the scuffle and separates the two artists] Look at yourselves!
Iggy
You're an Internet bullshit artist, Lorde!
Kyle's house, night. The doorbell rings and Kyle answers it. Stan comes in
Stan
Hey, what's up?
Kyle
You're not gonna believe this.
Stan
Oh no, what now?
Kyle
I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
Stan
Yeah?
Kyle
Come on! [leads Stan upstairs]
Ike's room. There are five other kids beside Ike in his room, and each one is using a tablet or a laptop, so no one is talking. Ike is watching PewDiePie on his monitor
PewDiePie
[giggling] He's just laying there.
Kyle
See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
PewDiePie
I'm going "Dun dun dadadun dun dadadun."
Kids
[in unison] PewDiePie!
Kyle
And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
Butters
Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
Cartman
Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
Kids
CartmanBrah!
Stan
Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
Conner
Okay Grandpa, we'll be sure to keep that in mind. [the kids laugh]
Stan
Grandpa?
Kyle
This is how they talk to us! [to Conner] You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
Kid 1
Yeah Conner, we're supposed to respect our elders, remember?
Kid 2
It's best to just make old people think they matter.
Stan
Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
Kid 2
No sir. Thank goodness we have you to do that. [Ike laughs at PewDiePie's gameplay]
Stan
We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
PewDiePie
Oh my God I killed him!
Back at the Pepsi Center, Iggy Azalea is performing.
Iggy
Missy who who?
That's all I do is rip off Missy.
Missy who?
Missy who? Missy who? Missy who who? Missy who who?

Alright bitches and hos, via hologram and shit, Michael Jackson! [two men from the Syntech Hologram Company get ready]
Tech 1
And, cue the hologram! [a bunch of special lights come on and produce the hologram, and the hologram performs Michael's signature moves. The crowd goes wild as Michael's music plays. The hologram moonwalks like Michael did]
MJ Hologram
Hee hee. [as the crowd roars, Iggy starts twerking to the hologram]
Randy
They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
Nicki
Oh Lorde, you're such a purist.
Randy
Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
Wendy: The Wendy Williams Show, now on air. Wendy comes out in a blue dress and black jacket
Wendy
Hi everybody. I love you!
Audience
Thanks for loving me. I love you too.
Wendy
So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy?? [the audience cheers in agreement] Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! [Instead of Cartman himself appearing on the couch, Cartman's commenter window pops up - he's doing this via satellite]
Cartman
CartmaaanBrah!
Wendy
So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
Cartman
Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
Wendy
And why do you think young people-?
Cartman
CartmaaanBrah!
Wendy
...Why do you think young people are responding to this? [Cartman mocks the question by asking it back in nonsense syllables] I'm asking you a question! [Cartman continues with the nonsense replies]
Cartman
CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
Back at the Pepsi Center, the MC is about to introduce Lorde. The crowd cheers loudly
MC
And now, give it up for the girl from New Zealand, LORDE!
Randy
Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there! [begins playing an acoustic guitar. Shelly is in the audience with Kelly and Stacy] Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya. [the cheering dies down] Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy. [the mood of the audience begins to change] Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya. [the audience begins to boo] And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh. [turns right and the mic falls to the ground] Oh God. Sorry. [bends over to pick up the mic...] Uh hold on.[...but drops the guitar instead. The boos intensify] Hang on, uh. [to bail Lorde out of this mess, the technicians bring Michael's hologram back to the stage]
MJ Hologram
Hee hee. [the hologram runs through the audience] I'm free! I'm free!
Randy
[dusts himself off] Sorry folks, just one second here.
The Pepsi Center entrance. Michael's hologram runs through the metal detector and begins to dance. Security guards are hot on his tail
MJ Hologram
Hee hee. Dah dadit dat ja!
Guard 1
Stop him. [another guard tries to grab the hologram, but realizes it can't be done. The hologram leaves the Center. The guards run out after it, and a guard guard gets on his walkie-talkie]
Guard 1
Michael Jackson's hologram is on the loose!
MJ Hologram
[leaving the parking area] Hee hee!
The Pepsi Center stage. Lorde is still on stage getting booed.
Randy
Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a. [the boos don't stop, and Randy's vision becomes prismatic] Okay, uh, uh... [steps aside and begins to simulate rubbing his "clit"] Oooo![hops onto the car on stage and continues the simulation] Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! [the boos are replaced by disgust. Shelly and friends are disappointed]
Fan
Ogh! Lorde, ewww!
Randy
Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! [fans begin to walk out of the concert]
The Marsh house, dining room. Sharon, Randy, and Stan are having dinner
Randy
Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan? [Stan reaches to his left and passes the potatoes to Randy] Great, thanks. [serves himself some potatoes] Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
Stan
Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
Randy
I was told to!
Sharon
You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
Randy
Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! [Stan hisses and leaves the table. Sharon just leaves. Some time later, Randy drops in on Shelly in her room and sees her crying on her bed, face down. He then notices that the Lorde poster on the wall is in tatters and ripped in half. Randy leaves and closes the door softly]
Kyle's house, day. Kyle walks around a darkened living room, rubbing his left hand along the coffee table, then along the TV, and he finds them dusty
Kyle
It's dying. The living room is... dying.
Randy's garage, night. Randy enters to talk to the record executive on the phone in private
Randy
Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?
Record Executive
What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin
Randy
Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
Record Executive
It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!
Randy
This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
The Rockies, day. A South Park City Transit bus is going to town, and Michael's hologram is in it. Everyone is on their iPhones or iPads
Passenger
Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy?
MJ Hologram
Yes.
Passenger
You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'?
MJ Hologram
No, I just need to... take care of some im-, important business.
Passenger
Oh, what kind of business? Oh are you a fisherman?
MJ Hologram
Yes. I mean, yes, that's all. I'm, I'm just gonna fish and hunt.
Passenger
Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon?
MJ Hologram
[stands up] Nobody! That's ignorant!
Passenger
Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey?
MJ Hologram
Allegedly! Allegedly! That's ignorant!
Passenger
You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent.
MJ Hologram
...That's ignorant. I'm just cold.
Passenger
I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.
MJ Hologram
Allegedly! I'm weary of this conversation! Can we please stop talking, please?! Ignorant!
Passenger
[looks him over] Well, whatever it is you're after, I hope you get it.
MJ Hologram
Oh I will. Trust me, I will. [The bus enters South Park.]
The Syntech Hologram Company, day. The record executive is with the tech working on the hologram problem
Tech 2
Ah, we've lost any ability to track the hologram's location. Ih...it looks like it reprogrammed its guidance systems.
Record Executive
We paid a lot of money for that hologram. You'd better find a way to get it back!
Tech 3
Project Alpha?
Tech 4
Yes. That might be our only option.
Record Executive
What is Project Alpha?
Tech 4
The first hologram we ever created to appear on stage. It was a prototype. But perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram-
Tech 3
Is another hologram. Bring up Project Alpha!
Tech 2
Sir, are you sure that we wanna-?
Tech 3
Bring it up! [Tech 2 gets to work. Everyone turns around and watches as the hologram is assembled]
Record Executive
What is that?
Tech 3
Tupac.
Tech 4
[approaches the hologram] Tupac? [the hologram is activated] Yo. The hologram of Michael Jackson is on the loose. We need you to "take care of the situation." [the hologram takes out a Glock hologram and cocks it, then he walks forward, then turns left and walks out]
Tech 3
Godspeed, Tupac.
The Syntech Hologram Company, outside. Tupac crosses the street and a car almost runs him down. The couple inside is in shock
Man
Oh my gosh, honey look it's Tupac! I told you them homies didn't cap his ass! [Tupac opens the driver's door, pulls the driver out and throws him to the ground, then gets into the driver's seat and takes off with the car and driver's wife. The driver gets up and pulls out his phone] Oh, this is going on Instagram! [takes the picture]
The bus stop, day. Cartman's commenter window is there in his place
Cartman
Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now. [the other three boys walk into view] Yep, there's Kyle, Stan and Kenny looking stupid as ever.
Kyle
I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
Stan
Tell me about it.
Cartman
Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
Kyle
You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
Cartman
[exasperated] Oh God.
Kyle
[notices the commenter window above the bus stop sign] Do you mind?!
Cartman
Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
Kyle
Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
Cartman
Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
Buca de Faggoncini, day. Randy goes inside. The record executive is waiting for him at a table. Randy approaches, but doesn't sit down.
Randy
Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. [the executive puts down his fork and wipes his lips off with a napkin.]
Record Executive
Sit down, Lorde.
Randy
I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
Record Executive
[stands up and walks to a nearby bar] Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more. [pours himself a drink] Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on. [turns around] The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level.
Randy
Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
Record Executive
On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
Randy
I'll do no such thing!
Record Executive
Who said anything about you? [whips out a small remote control and presses a button on it. Some lasers turn on and assemble a new hologram. It's Lorde's hologram. It walks up to the executive and stands beside him. Randy is frightened and takes several steps back. Two bodyguards appear behind him, and he notices. The executive closes the blinds]
Randy
You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
Record Executive
Today, commentary IS the content. And you, I'm afraid, are just in the way. [the bodyguards quickly escort him out]
South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison wipes off the previous night's work from the blackboard.
Mr. Garrison
Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
Kyle
[walks up to the front of the class and turns around. He reads from a sheet of paper] What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
Cartman
[his commenter window pops up] Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.
Mr. Garrison
What the hell is that?
Kyle
It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
Cartman
Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
Mr. Garrison
What the hell?
Cartman
This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
Butters
It's true!
Cartman
Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
Butters
Heheyehah.
Kyle
There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
Cartman
[mocking] There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
Kyle
Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!
Mr. Garrison
I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
Kyle
THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
Cartman
[mocking] This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
Mr. Mackey
Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!
Cartman
What the hell did I do?
Principal Victoria's office, later.
Principal Victoria
Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
Cartman
Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
Principal Victoria
Eric, I am talking to YOU!
Cartman
Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
The Marsh house. Randy rushes in through the front door
Randy
Sharon? Sharon!
Sharon
[comes down the stairs in her bath robe] Randy? What's going on?
Randy
They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
Sharon
Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?
Randy
The hologram's in our bedroom?
Sharon
Yes!
Tupac's Hologram
I've gotta be leavin' now, Sharon. I would leave you my number but I'm just a hologram 'n shit.
Randy
You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
The record executive's limousine, back seat. Cartman's commenter window is there with the record executive
Record Executive
It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all?
Cartman
[in his commenter window] Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!
Record Executive
Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level.
Cartman
Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!
End of REHASH

HappyHolograms
Kyle's house, a snowy day. He's preparing for Hanukkah, setting up the menorah with nine candles. He's lit the second candle, for the second day of Hanukkah, then takes a selfie of himself and the menorah
Kyle
It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.
Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
[leaves the menorah and stops by Ike's room, and looks in]

This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube. [Ike is watching "Call of Duty" on his computer]

Cartman
[his commenter window pops up on screen] Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
Kyle
Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.
Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
[Kyle looks at the floor, turns back and walks away. he stops by the kitchen, then by his dad's study. Gerald takes a selfie with his pet project: a model of a ship]

Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,br />All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying. [he walks through the living room, then stops and looks around]

Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski, [he looks at the TV and walks up to it]

What brought families together most was a good old TV [he walks through the park with his head down]

Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw. [he sees a little girl on a bench looking at her iPhone]

And if you try to complain, you get called a-

Girl
Grandpa!
Kyle
I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
Kyle
[Now at his own desk]
But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon. [The following is the tweet]

The more connected we get, the more alone we become.
If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,
Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom [finishes the tweet but doesn't submit it yet. He's wearing a tee shirt with #savethelivingroom on it]

Kyle
Whattaya think?
Butters
Hmmm, it's kind of gay.
Kyle
Really??
Butters
I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
Kyle
Hm, I wasn't really going for "gay," I was more going for "wholesome."
Butters
Well, gay is wholesome.
Kyle
But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
Sheila
[knocks, then enters] Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.
Kyle
Bill Cosby.
Sheila
Yes.
Kyle
Is here. To see me.
Sheila
Yes. [turns around and leaves]
The living room, moments later. Kyle and Butters come downstairs and see Bill
Bill Cosby
Oh! There he is comin' down the stairs.
Kyle
Hello.
Bill Cosby
Hello, son. Your savethelivingroom hash tag is getting a lot of attention and we think it's great.
Kyle
We?
Bill Cosby
I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend. [notices how dusty the TV is and wipes some of the dust off with his right hand] It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now.
Kyle
Wow. [smiles] Well that's awesome!
Bill Cosby
Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours.
Kyle
M-Ah, I'd love to.
Bill Cosby
Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly!
Kyle
Uh okay! No problem! [Bill lets himself out]
Bill Cosby
This holiday special is gonna bring families together again, son!
Kyle
Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!
Bill Cosby
Happy Holidays! [Kyle closes the door, and Bill's glitch appears as he walks away - this Bill is a hologram]
Park County Police Station. Detective Harries is grilling Randy and Sharon on their story.
Det. Harris
Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?
Randy
Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
Officer 1
[with mustache] Who's the famous artist?
Randy
Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
Det. Harris
You're Lorde.
Sharon
The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.
Officer 1
You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
Randy
No! That was a copy of me!
Officer 2
Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh! [bemused smile which quickly fades.]
Randy
Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
Officer 3
[runs into the station] Detective Harris! Sir! We've got a problem!
Det. Harris
[turns around] What is it, Adams?
Adams
[Officer 3] We've arrested a black man who was snooping around the old Jefferson estate!
Det. Harris
Did you choke him?
Adams
Yes!
Det. Harris
Did you shoot him?
Adams
YES!
Det. Harris
So what's the problem?
Adams
He... appears to be just a hologram, sir.
MJ's Hologram
[brought in by another officer, somehow handcuffed] Naw, it's ignorant! You don't understand! We have to stop them! Heee hee!
Det. Harris
Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??
Stan's house, day. The doorbell rings and he answers it. It's Kyle.
Kyle
[excitedly] Dude, what are you doing?!
Stan
[texting] Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
Kyle
They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
Stan
Who did?
Kyle
These producers making a big holiday special! [goes to the TV and wipes it clean] They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
Stan
That's a little strange, isn't it?
Kyle
No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
The commercial begins
Announcer
From the producers of Women Of Rock Live and The Rockefeller Tree Lighting Ceremony, it's the holiday television event of the season! With appearances by [the guest stars are shown as they're mentioned] Al Pacino [on a sled going down a hill] Iggy Azalea [wearing a black and white outfit, with her ass dressed up as a snowman] J.J. Watt [clutching a reindeer] Miley Cyrus [dressed as an elf, swinging from a huge Christmas ornament and sticking her tongue out] U2 [presenting gifts] Angelina Jolie [dressed as an elf and scratching her crotch] Bill Cosby and Taylor Swift [he offers her a drink, she declines it] A hologram of Elvis Presley [a National Enquire tabloid drops down to reveal him, then a bigfoot appears behind him] Kurt Cobain's hologram [pops up from a chimney and waves hello with his hat] The hologram of Robin Williams [wearing reindeer horns and festive clothes, pops his clown nose off] Tom Hanks, Lorde [he holds up a mistletoe as her hologram turns around] First Lady Michelle Obama [licks a huge candy cane] And Michael Jackson's hologram as Peter Pan.
MJ's hologram
[flits through the air] I'm flying! Hee dah dada dat dih
Announcer
And featuring live commentary the entire show by CartmanBrah.
Cartman
CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?
Announcer
There's something for every generation to bring families together.
Kyle
Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
Cartman
He's such a douchebag.
Announcer
It's all live and it's all magical. It's the Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special.
Cartman
Now we're talkin'! [the commenter window disappears and Stan and Kyle are stunned]
Kyle
That son of a bitch!
Stan
That self-promoting asshole!
Kyle
Why would he do this?!
Stan
Because my dad's an idiot!
Kyle
Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
Stan
Nnnothing, nothing.
The record producer's office, day. CartmanBrah is there with the other executives in the office
Cartman
Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. [eats some chips]
Exec. 1
So far the holiday special is trending fine, but it appears that the Michael Jackson hologram is the most heavily tweeted.
Record Producer
And we still have no idea where the damned hologram is?
Ron
Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down.
Cartman
Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
Record Producer
We got one shot at this, people! This [pounds his fist on the table] has to be the holiday special to end all holiday specials!
Ron
Sir, I get that you brought this YouTube commentator in because he's popular with the younger kids, but now he's trying to tell us what the show should be called??
Record Producer
He's got his finger on the pulse of young America.
Exec. 2
Sir, I'm pretty sure that [reads from his phone] "Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special" is not a good name.
Cartman
No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!
Ron
[leans in] If I may be frank, sir, I think you're giving this kid a little too much power!
Cartman
I can hear you, douchebag.
Record Producer
People, you know what we're trying to do here. [leaves his desk and paces the room] We're trying to finally create entertainment that reaches the younger generation, that unites the young with the old. That means being hip, being now.
Cartman
These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
Record Producer
There, you see that? "Blumpkin catchers." Do any of you even know what that means? This kid is our way to connect with the youth of America, and I'm gonna give him all the power he needs.
Cartman
G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
Park County Police Station. Harris goes over skin color with the other cops and some color swatches. Randy, Sharon, and MJ's hologram are at the far end of the office space
Officer 4
What about this, sir? Burnt sienna?
Det. Harris
He's not a Native American, damnit! That's obvious!
Officer 1
I'll, I'll put it in the report he's Mylar brown.
Det. Harris
That isn't even close! We have to be able to prove that hologram is a light-skinned black guy!
Randy
Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde.
MJ's hologram
Who? Lorde? You're not Lorde, that's ignorant.
Randy
Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
MJ's hologram
They're gonna make a big holiday special. They've got holograms and YouTube commentators and live tweeting and it's ignorant! It's gonna be the most ignorant holiday special ever!
Randy
A holiday special. Oh my God.
MJ's hologram
It's directed at children! We have to stop them!
Officer 4
Huh how about we say he's mixed race?
Det. Harris
As long as Adams only choked the black half, I think it's okay.
Randy
[to Sharon] I should have known. Bastards always talked about a day when social media and entertainment would be fused as one! I didn't know they meant a Christmas special! [to MJ's hologram] Can you help me stop them?!
MJ's hologram
Yes. We have to reach the children. It's our only hope.
Randy
Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
MJ's hologram
[stands up] ALLEGEDLY! [the officers look at him] THAT WAS A CIVIL SUIT AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE! [sits down] It's ignorant.
Kyle's house. He stops by the kitchen with Stan as Sheila reads her iPad
Kyle
Mom?! Where is Ike?!
Sheila
Oh Kyle! Your hash tag is really trending. I saw the commercial.
Kyle
That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
Sheila
He's upstairs playing with all his friends.
Ike's room. Kyle and Stan rush inside
PewDiePie
Oh my God, that's the ugliest...
Kyle
Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
Kid 2
Old people are so funny.
Conner
They really just don't get it.
Kid 3
And they smell like soap.
Stan
We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
Kid 4
Careful Grandpa, you might crap your Depends! [the kids laugh, even Ike]
Kyle
WE'RE NOT BEING GRANDPAS!
Stan
Yeah, you damn kids!
PewDiePie
...that's the lamest...
Park County Police Station, upstairs. The officers still haven't come to a conclusion about MJ's hologram
Det. Harris
Okay, okay, so we're agreeing the hologram is black. So the question is, if he's black, then how come we couldn't choke him?
Park County Police Station, front office. A police officer stands behind the front desk. The doors open and in walks Tupac's hologram
Front Desk Officer
Can I help you? [the hologram looks at him and moves away] Eh-excuse me. Can I help you? [the hologram moves deeper into the building. A security camera shows him walking down a hallway. The front desk officer runs into the office] Sir? A black guy walked into the police station!
Det. Harris
Heh, uh huh? [looks at the officer and grins]
Front Desk Officer
Well a, a black guy walked into the police station.
Det. Harris
[chuckling, anticipating a joke] Yeah? Wait. Mitchell, listen to this one. [Mitchell appears in the background] Start over: what's the setup?
Front Desk Officer
There's this black guy, walked into the police station.
Mitchell
Oh yeah, I think I've heard it, but go ahead.
Front Desk Officer
No, really, a black guy walked into the-!
Mitchell
Ohhh ya ya ya? "We set who free?"
Front Desk Officer
No no, a black guy literally walked into the police station!
Det. Harris
Oh, it's a new one. [Tupac's hologram walks in] Aw, shit! Look out! [the officers quickly draw their weapons]
Officer 4
It's a black guy! Choke him!
Det. Harris
Shoot him!
Officer 4
Shoot him and then choke him! [the front desk officer shoots the hologram, but the bullet just goes through and disrupts the hologram's structural integrity. The officer tries to choke the hologram, but the arms just go through it]
MJ's hologram
He's here to kill us! Run!! Heee heee! [they escape while the officers shoot at Tupac's hologram. They go down the fire escape unnoticed]
Cartman's house. Kyle and Stan walk up to his room. Kyle tries to open the door, but finds it locked. He then pounds on the door
Kyle
Cartman, open this door right now!
Cartman
[his commenter window pops up] Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
Kyle
What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
Kyle
Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
Cartman
How do you even know I'm here in my room?
Kyle
Because you just said, "here in my room"!
Cartman
...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions. [Kyle tries breaking his way into the room] You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. [Kyle stops]
Stan
Cartman, please! We have to stop this show! Lorde is going to do something horrible and corrupt little girls everywhere!
Cartman
Why does that matter?
Stan
Because Lorde is my dad, alright?! [walks forward as his anger drains away] Lorde is my dad.
Cartman
What?
Kyle
What are you talking about, Stan?
Stan
He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
Cartman
Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. [the commenter window disappears]
Kyle
Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
Stan
It just all seemed so... stupid.
Kyle
I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
Meanwhile, at the Marsh house. Randy, Sharon, and MJ's hologram enter the house and sit on the sofa
Sharon
See if it started!
Randy
We don't really use this thing anymore. [grabs the remote and turns on the TV] It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!
Sharon
[puts her hand on Randy's shoulder] Randy, what about Shelly?
Randy
Oh my God...
MJ's hologram
Shelly? Who's Shelly? That's ignorant.
Randy
My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
Sharon
How are you going to tell her that the singer she's idolized has been you?
Randy
I guess... one step at a time.
Shelly's room, moments later. Randy knocks on her door, then looks in. Shelly is looking at her monitor
Randy
Shelly? Um, I'm Lorde. [she sits up a little] All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. [blows her a kiss and closes the door, then to Michael's hologram]Whew, that was hard.
Sharon
RANDY?! [Randy and Michael's hologram head downstairs]
The living room. The men reach the foot of the stairs
Sharon
It's started.
Announcer
And now, Nabisco and Dolly Madison present, The Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special! [CartmanBrah appears in a window at upper left of the screen]
And now, live via hologram, it's Kurt Cobain. [he appears in a Christmas fireplace setting]

Cartman
Oh, this should be good.
Kurt's hologram
[begins to sing]
Up on the housetop, reindeer pause out jumps good ole Santa Claus

Cartman
I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
Kurt's hologram
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, girls and boys [reaches to his left for a double-barreled shotgun and waves it around as if marching]
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go
Yeh-he-he-eah who wouldn't go [loads and cocks the shotgun]
Up on the housetop clickity click click [aims it at his mouth as if to shoot himself]
Down through the chimney with good St. Nick? [waves it around again, then stops]

Cartman
Hoh, this should get some comments. [Kurt's hologram fires the rifle and a small flag saying "Merry Christmas" pops out. He grins]
The control room. Ron is in charge
Ron
Stand by on camera 4. Boost the live Twitter feed. Aaand cue the hash tag! How are we trending?
Controller 1
Trending at 64% and steady.
Ron
[on the phone with the producer] We're trending at 64%, sir.
Buca de Faggoncini. The record producer is having dinner
Record Producer
Excellent. I'm just about to deal with our last order of business now.
Kyle
[walks into the restaurant and towards the producer with Stan] Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
Record Producer
No no, thank you! [wipes his lips clean] If you hadn't called, I... wouldn't know what I know now. [gets up and walks towards the bar, dialing a number in the process]
Stan
Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
Record Producer
It's me. I've got somethin' you might be interested in.
Randy
[on the line in the master bedroom] I don't think so, you son of a bitch! [Sharon and Michael's hologram are also there]
Record Producer
I've got your son here, Lorde. If you don't cooperate, he dies.
Stan
What?? [both he and Kyle are scared]
Randy
Stanley?! YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS!
The living room. Randy runs downstairs with Sharon following
Sharon
Randy, where are you going?!
Randy
THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON! [just as he reaches the front door, it opens and Tupac's hologram walks in] SHIT!! [runs to the back door.]
Out front, at least 14 police cruisers and one tank roll up to the house. Some of them drift into position. Officers jump out of the cars and arm themselves.
Det. Harris
[on his bullhorn] All right, listen up! We believe this is where the black people are! They're holograms, so we can't choke them or shoot them, so stand by till we figure out what the hell to do!
Officer 5
[runs up] Sir! You'd better see this! [holds out a phone, which Detective Harris looks at] There's something new trending! #copscantgoaroundchokingblackpeople.
Det. Harris
We know we can't, but we're trying to! Jesus, tell them we're workiing on it!
Officer 6
No, sir, I I think they mean we shouldn't. Like we're racist or something.
Det. Harris
What?! We're not racists.
Peterson
Sir, we've got confirmation. There's two black guys in the upstairs of the house!
Det. Harris
[turns around anticipating another joke] Uh huh, go ahead.
Peterson
Two black guys. One of them is threatening the other one.
Det. Harris
Yehah? Hang on! Mitch! [Mitchell appears again] Two black guys in the upstairs of the house. One of them is threatening the other one. [to Peterson] Okay, go ahead.
Back at the holiday special
Announcer
And now, together at last, Iggy Azalea and Elvis. [Elvis' hologram is playing the ukulele]
Cartman
Oh bros, weak!
Elvis' Hologram
Have a jolly holly Christmas

Iggy's Ass
It's the best time of the pfffffffft.

Elvis' Hologram
I don't know if there'll be snow
but have a cup of

Iggy's Ass
Pfffffffft

Cartman
Oh weak, bros, so weak!
Back at the control room. Ron has his back to the monitors
Controller 2
It's incredible! I've never seen trending like this!
Ron
[turns around] We're trending well?
Controller 1
We're barely trending at all. But #ihatecartmanbrah is trending off the charts!
Controller 2
He's right. ihatecartmanbrah is trending at 96% and climbing.
Ron
That's impossible.
Back at Buca de Faggoncini, the record producer pours himself another drink
Kyle
How can you be willing to kill people for a holiday special? What's wrong with you?
Record Producer
It was five years ago that I... became a grandpa. At first it was wonderful. I wanted to show my grandson everything. Teach him all about the entertainment business. One day I aasked him, "Who's your favorite celebrity?" You know what he said to me? He said, "PeewwDiePie." I had no idea who [turns around] he was talking about. So I looked it up. And he was this insignificant little game blogger from Sweden who my grandson thought was a god! No matter who else I tried to impress him with, he would just say, "Meh." To me! MEH! [turns back to the bar] What the hell is wrong with these kids today?? With this special, we will assimilate this generation's culture into ours! MAKE THEM APPRECIATE REAL ENTERTAINMENT, DAMNIT! [pounds theh bar with his fist]
Stan
Dude. You're such a grandpa.
Record Producer
[angrily clears everything off the bar] I AM NOT A GRANDPAAA!
Back at the holiday special, it's Bill Cosby and Taylor Swift in the second duet
Taylor
Well I guess it's time to leave.

Bill's hologram
Oh but it's snowin' out dere.

Taylor
Yeah but I need to get home.

Bill's hologram
But it's snowin' out dere.

Taylor
I really should go

Bill's hologram
Oh what's the hurry?

Taylor
Say, what's in this drink?'

Bill's hologram
That's just some J-E-L-L-O.

Taylor
The holidays are comin'-

Dad
This is the oddest holiday special I've ever seen.
Mom
Maybe we should turn it off.
Cartman
[his commenter window appears] Oh wow, where are we now, brahs? [the family looks at him] This looks pretty stupid.
Dad
What the heck? [tries to turn the TV off, but it won't turn off]
Cartman
CartmaanBrah!
Dad
[smacks the remote on his left hand a few times] This damn TV! What is that window doing outside the holiday special?! [tries turning the TV off again]
Mom
Call customer service.
Customer service, Steve answering
Steve
Panasonic customer service. How can I help you?
Dad
Yeah, we've got a commenter window in our living room. How do I get rid of that?
Steve
Ohhhh yes yes yes yes. Many people are calling about this. We have NO idea what's going on. Have I answered all your questions in a timely manner?
Cartman
[his commenter window appears] Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!
The holiday special control room
Ron
This isn't part of the holiday special! What is he doing?!
Controller 2
He's trending more than we ever thought possible.!
Cartman
[his commenter window appears] Yes, with every passing second I become more powerful.
Stan's house, out front. The cops are laughing their asses off now
Det. Harris
[laughing with them] Okay! Okay, okay okay okay. Go ahead.
Peterson
So, then, the first black guy said to the second black guy, "Don't shoot me. I'm on your side."
Det. Harris
Okay! Okay. Okay. Hold on. [catches his breath] Okay, go ahead.
Peterson
And then the, the the tattooed black guy said, to him, "I ain't gonna kill you, man. You're the King of Pop. Let's go cap that whitey producer."
Det. Harris
Oh God! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Cartman
[his commenter window appears] Happy holidays, everyone! [the cops stop laughing and look at the window] Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
Buca de Faggoncini. Cartman's commenter window is now a fixture
Record Producer
Damn it, you're ruining the show!
Cartman
Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
Kyle
I am so confused.
Record Producer
[to Ron] Shut him down!'
Ron
We can't, sir!
Cartman
I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.
Stephen
I'm confused. Why this holiday special and what is it?
Cartman
It's all CartmanBrah now. [a shot of Times Square. Cartman's image replaces everything else on the screens there] I am trending into something more than human. I am becoming... transgender. [a shot of the Times Square crowd, looking at the screens in disbelief] Now they will HAVE to give my my own bathroom!
Record Producer
This is not what I hired you for! I CONTROL TALENT, DAMNIT!
MJ's hologram
[bursts through the doors with Tupac's hologram] There he is! That's the ignorant man!
Record Producer
This is crazy and everyone is watching everything!
Kyle
[thinking aloud] Everyone is watching everything. [turns right and walks up to a camera] Ike? [switch to Ike's room] Ike, if you can hear me, I'm sorry. I have been a grandpa. [Ike's friends look at the monitor] I didn't understand the things you are into and I and I thought you should like the same stuff that I did. [Michael's hologram walks up to the record producer and shoots him in the head, killing him] I have to accept that you're gonna have your own things. I just didn't want you to watch HIM. I just... I just wanna be a family again.
Kid 4
Oh, I feel bad for the little guy.
Conner
There's nothing sadder than a old man crying.
Kid 3
Maybe we should help
Ike
Yeah!
Kid 2
Okay.
Kyle
Help? How can you help?
Kid 2
It's the holiday season. We just need to get everyone to believe again.
Conner
Yeah, someone can come change all this. You know who.
Kyle
Really? That's what you guys would do?
Conner
Of course! We just need to get everyone to believe in him. He'll always come and help. #webelieveinyou
Kyle
Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
MJ's hologram
We believe in you. Of course!
Kyle
[walks ever closer to the camera] You too! Right now! #webelieveinyou! We've got to make him appear! [the signal is now disrupted]
Cartman
Hey! What's going on? What is that? [amid some special effects of snow and holly popping out of the upper right corner of screens everywhere, PewDiePie's commenter window appears]
PewDiePie
How's it goin' bros? This is [goes fullscreen]PewDiePie!
Cartman
What the hell?!
Kids
PewDiePie!
Kyle
PewDiePie?!
PewDiePie
Thanks for all the shoutouts. I guess there's some little fat kid trying to be me, so let's check it out.
Cartman
Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!
PewDiePie
[mocking Cartman] God damn it, get out of here!
Cartman
Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
PewDiePie
This show is getting kind of boring, bros. What do you say we change it out to something more exciting?
Cartman
Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
PewDiePie
I know! Let's play Call of Duty! [the game pops up fullscreen and the commenter windows switch places]
Cartman
No! You can't do this!
PewDiePie
Ohhh yeah! This is more like it, bros!
Cartman
God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
PewDiePie
Okay, that little fat kid is getting annoying. Let's get rid of him!
Cartman
NOOOO! [his commenter window disappears, as well as the holiday special]
PewDiePie
Oh yeah! Way better, bros! This is how we do it in Sweden! BOOM head shot! BOOM head shot!
South Park, next morning. At Stark's Pond, Stan and Kyle sit on a bench and look out over the lake.
Kyle
Well, I finally got my family to use the living room for an hour each night.
Stan
I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
Kyle
Yeah. I guess that's the point. I don't think we're gonna understand. Maybe this IS all the beginning of a new art form. YouTube celebrities are only getting bigger. And what's great is that these people are inventing themselves, instead of being marketed and shoved down our throats.
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
No matter what we think, it's not just a passing trend. We need to realize that the new generation of entertainment is here. [notices PewDiePie's commenter window pop up to his right and above] And I, think that's great.
Stan
Yeah, I think that's great too.
PewDiePie
Alright bros, it look like we'll have to end it there. I wanna thank South Park for being in my show. I hope you bros enjoyed watching, and as always, stay awesome!
[over the end credits] Oh! That's it bros. Show's over.

End of HappyHolograms

Stunning and Brave
South Park Elementary cafeteria, night. Emergency All School meeting. Students and their parents file into the cafeteria and find seats. Mr. Mackey approaches the mic
Mr. Mackey
Alright parents and students, please take your seats. [A gleeful Randy crumples a sheet of paper into a ball and throws it at him as Sharon looks on. The crumpled up paper strikes Mr. Mackey, who tries to deflect it and gets annoyed] Okay, okay. Now as you know, There was an incident at the school last week involving a student referring to rape as a "hot Cosby," okay? [everyone laughs. Cartman looks around, smiling] Listen, listen! Principal Victoria has been fired!
Various adults
What? Fired?
Cartman
Sweet dude!
Mr. Mackey
And a new person has been appointed to try and make South Park Elementary a more... progressive place that... fits in with today's times. Heh ukay? So please welcome... PC Principal. [a burly man holding a sports bottle walks through the cafeteria. He sports a goatee, a hint of a mustache, and Oakley sunglasses. He swallows the last of the drink and throws the bottle off to one side]
PC Principal
Alright, listen up. My name is PC Principal. I don't know about you, but frankly I'm sick and tired of how minority groups are marginalized in today's society. I'm here because this place is lost in a time warp! Students who still use the word "retarded"! A teacher who said women without wombs should get an AIDS test!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, I was a [takes his right wrist and flips it forward] lesbian then.
PC Principal
A chef "person of color" who the children had sing soul songs and who the children drove to kill himself!
Butters
No, he got brainwashed by a cult.
PC Principal
[aims his left index finger at Butters] And that's two days' detention for you, young man! We'll see you at 4!
Butters
What??
PC Principal
Let me ask you this. We're in Colorado, right?! Where are the Hispanic kids?! Huh?! Where are the ethnic and racial minorities?!
Mr. Mackey
Well, we have Token; he's black.
PC Principal
[aims his left index finger at Mr. Mackey] And that's two days' detention for you, Mackey! Congratulations!
Mr. Mackey
Wha- I got detention?
PC Principal
I Googled South Park before I came here, and I cannot believe the shit you're getting away with! People claiming to be advocates of transgender rights, but really just wanting to use the women's bathroom! [Sharon and Stan look at Randy] A white man who thinks he's Chinese and built a wall to keep out Mongolians.
Tuong Lu Kim
Ohhhh I hate-a Mongorians!
PC Principal
What the fuck is this?! Are you fucking kidding me?! I'm telling you all, this is done! Like it or not, PC is back, and it's bigger than ever! Weoo-weoo-weoo You hear that?! That's the sound of 2015 pulling you over, people! Suck it! [holds his right arm out and lets the mic drop to the floor from his hand]
South Park Elementary, day. Kids walk here and there in the hall. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk together
Stan
[looking around] Man, I guess things are going to be different around here.
Kyle
You know what? I think it's good. Let's face it: this is long overdue.
Butters
[runs up to the other three] Did you guys hear? Cartman got four days' detention, for calling Heidi Turner "clitty litter"!
Kenny
(Really?)
Butters
But the thing is, Eric isn't even fightin' it. It's like he's all sad and scared.
Kyle
Good! He should be sad and scared! These things do matter and I already feel better to be at a school where we can start to have a dialogue and talk about this stuff.
Mr. Mackey
[over the P.A. system] Will uh, Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office immediately? Uhkay? Kyle Broflovski. [Kyle walks off] Did I, did I say that all right?
The principal's office, some time later. Gerald opens the office door and steps in
Gerald
Uhm, hi, I'm Gerald, Kyle Broflovski's father.
PC Principal
Have a seat. I've been talking with your child, and we're gonna be giving him two weeks' detention.
Gerald
[to Kyle, in a hushed voice] Wull, what's this about, Kyle?
PC Principal
Your son said some things to a fourth-grade girl that frankly make me wanna puke! Now that I'm principal, I'm not gonna allow [pounds the desk with his left fist] anyone at this school to be made feel unsafe and harassed!
Gerald
Wh-wh-what did he say?
PC Principal
[takes off his sunglasses] You'll have to excuse my language. [picks up a report and clears his throat] "I don't think Caitlyn Jenner is a hero." [no reaction from Gerald or Kyle. PC Principal gets ready to erupt] This kind of transphobic and [pounds the desk with his left fist] bigoted hate speech isn't gonna fly here, bro! Well I though we were all on board that Caitlyn Jenner is an amazing, [quickly stands up] beautiful woman who had the exquisite bravery of a butterfly flying against the wind. And then this shit comes out of people's mouths!
Gerald
PC Principal, I, I'm sure Kyle was just referring to Bruce Jenner as a person, and not trying to say anything against-
PC Principal
You got a fuckin' problem bro?!
Gerald
No...
PC Principal
'Cause it's not Bruce fuckin' Jenner! It's Caitlyn, and she's a fuckin' stunning woman! Or maybe you're the one teaching him to demean women in the first place! HUH?! What's up?! What's fuckin' up, bro?
Gerald
Look, maybe we can all just ta-
PC Principal
Get the fuck out of here, dude! [turns the desk over, sending papers all over the place]
Gerald and Kyle
[alarmed] Aaah! [Gerald takes Kyle and they both rush to the door, open it, and rush out]
Crunchy's Micro Brew. The men of the town have gathered at this new watering hole. At the center table sit Stuart, Stephen, Randy, Gerald, and Ryan Valmer
Randy
I mean, who the hell does this guy think he is? Some college kid's gonna come in and tell us our ways are old?
Stuart
Yeah. And, you can't bully our kids like that.
Gerald
Kyle's already got two weeks of detention.
Stephen
Huh for what?!
Gerald
Just 'cause he said something about Caitlyn Jenner. [a hush falls over the table]
Stephen
Oh, Caitlyn Jenner. she's a hero. She is stunning and brave.
Stuart
Stunning. She is absolutely beautiful, and an inspiration.
Ryan
Yup!
Randy
Yup, that's right.
Gerald
Well what the hell were you guys talki-
Ryan
we've gotta be careful, Gerald. This is a college bar.
PC Bro 1
Somebody here have a problem with Caitlyn Jenner?
Ryan
No.
PC Bro 1
No? 'Cause she's a stunning, beautiful woman, and if you wanna call her anything else I'm ready to fuckin' throw down!
Stuart
No no, we're totally fine with it.
PC Bro 2
Weoo-weoo-weoo-weoo-weoo! [walks up waving his left hand over his head like a police siren] It? Did somebody just refer to Caitlyn Jenner as "it"? I'm PC, bro. I'll throw down!
PC Bro 1
Sweet. You're PC bro?
PC Bro 2
Yeah, Arizona State.
PC Bro 1
Sweet, bro. I'm PC UMass.
PC Bro 2
Fuck yeah! Sweet, dude! [holds up his left hand open]
PC Bro 1
[clasps the other guy's left hand with his own] Sweet! [releases the grip] So, do we have a fuckin' problem here?
Stephen
No! Caitlyn Jenner is the bravest woman in America.
PC Bro 3
Weoo-eoowoo-eoowoo-oo! [walks up waving his right hand over his head like a police siren] Did someone here just say "America" in a way that "other-izes" and demeans the people of Latin and South America?!
PC Bro 2
Nice, dude. You PC?
PC Bro 3
Yeah, Chino Hills. [to the seated men] You think Venezuelans aren't Americans, brah?!
PC Bro 2
Yeah, you wanna make fun of me?!
PC Principal
[notices the commotion and walks up] Hey! What seems to be the problem here, gentlemen?!
PC Bro 1
Who the hell are you?!
PC Principal
I'm PC Principal.
PC Bro 2
Oh nice. We're all PC too.
PC Principal
No way! There's more PC bros here?
PC Bro 4
Yeah dude, Ohio State.
PC Principal
Sweet, bros. Texas A&M. Bro, I had no idea there were like-minded individuals in this town that defended social minorities. We should all hang out.
PC Bro 1
We should totally hang out.
PC Bro 4
We should all get a house together and unite our tolerant views.
PC Bro 1
Fuckin' do it, dude!
PC Bro 4
Fuck yeah!
A new frat house in South Park - Rho Omega Delta - night. PC bros are everywhere, lifting weights, fighting, drinking from kegs, having a good time. Two of them are on a balcony drinking PBR as two farmers gaze at the house from a distance.
Janitor
Well, looks like thangs are gettin' all PC again. [a shot of the house again]
Friend
Well how long d'you think this will last?
Janitor
Lasted about six years last time. We got at least [checks his watch] 5.9 years to go.
South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings, and Cartman is at his locker getting his back pack. The other boys walk up to him.
Kyle
Uhhh, hey Cartman. Uhwaht's goin' on? Aren't you going to ah, you know, go do something about this new principal?
Cartman
I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.
Stan
But, this isn't you, Cartman.
Kyle
Yeah, where is the Eric Cartman we know? The Eric Cartman we know breaks the rules. And he gets away with it. Just like his hero! Come on, who's your hero, Cartman?!
Cartman
[sighs heavily] Tom Brady.
Stan
Right! And what does Tom Brady do after breaking the rules?
Cartman
Deny and subvert.
Stan
Yeah!
Butters
Yeah, what? Well what would Tom Brady say if he got caught shoplifting.
Cartman
Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me?
Butters
Yeah!
Kyle
[walks up to Cartman] You're Tom Brady, Cartman! And that new principal in there is the football commissioner trying to dictate his punishment to you. And what happens when an invulnerable cheater comes up against an elitist corporate dictator?
Cartman
A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.
Cartman
[pacing back and forth] You're right, guys. I'm gonna Tom Brady this thing!
Boys
Yeah!
Cartman
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say "You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!"
Boys
Yeah!
Cartman
NO! No, to hell with that! "You're giving me NO days detention! And then I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife! Who's not even that hot, and kinda looks like a dude!" [marches off]
Boys
Yeah!
Cartman
[turns around] Thanks, guys. I almost forgot the lessons that football has taught us all. I can get around these pesky rules. Butters, I'm going to need your underwear. [walks off]
Butters
Well ohhh-kay! [walks off after Cartman]
Kyle
Cool. I think we did it. [raises his left arm, and Stan high-fives it]
South Park Elementary, hallway. PC Principal walks through it like the Big Man On Campus. The kids look up at him in awe. He reaches the stairs leading up to the faculty bathroom. Nearby Jenny Simons looks at him, he looks back. He opens his arms as if to scare a bear, then he takes a step in Jenny's direction. Jenny backs away immediately. PC Principal goes downstairs.
Faculty bathroom, moments later. PC Principal puts his glasses behind his head and does his business at the urinal. Cartman drops down from the toilet in the stall behind the principal and steps outside the stall
Cartman
Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?
PC Principal
What are you doing in the faculty bathroom?
Cartman
You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school.
PC Principal
What the fuck are you talking about?
Cartman
It's just a request, that's all. See you around. [stops and looks down] Oh, you seem to have dropped something, PC Principal. [picks it up] What's this? Why, this is a little boy's underwear. [sniffs at it] Why, this is Butters' underwear.
PC Principal
[zips up and looks at Cartman] What?
Cartman
PC Principal, you have Butters' underwear and now... [drops it into the urinal and soaks it in PC Principal's urine - the principal had not flushed the urinal - and pulls the briefs out.] Oh my gosh, it's got your DNA all over it. [through some windows above the urinal, Kyle, Butters, Craig, Stan, and Token watch the action unfold] This certainly doesn't look good for you. I don't need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. Capiche?
PC Principal
What did you just say?
Cartman
You mean about keeping your dick out?
PC Principal
"Capiche"?! You're associating Italian-Americans to intimidation tactics?! [one by one, the boys' smiles disappear] You'd better watch your micro-aggression's, bro! [now the boys are afraid of the next move]
Cartman
Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you?
PC Principal
Did you just use a term that excludes women from an occupation?! [picks Cartman up...]
Cartman
Okay, let's back up. [...and slams him against the stall] Aaah!
PC Principal
[slams him several times into the wall next to the mirror] Did you just say "spokesman" instead of "spokesperson"?! When women are just as capable at selling sandwiches as anyone?! [slams Cartman into the mirror, shattering it] Are you purposely trying to use words that assert your male privilege?! [slams Cartman into a sink, shattering it]
Cartman
[quuickly] No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters!
PC Principal
[ignoring him] Do you think Italian-Americans and women are less important?! [pins Cartman to the floor and starts beating him up]
Cartman
Oh God!
PC Principal
You dare to use words that alienate two communities of people who have to deal with verbal biases like yours on a daily basis?! [beats him up some more. The other boys leave the window and walk away.]
Rho Omega Delta house. The frat bros are having a good time as "Genius of Love" plays in the background. Randy looks out from his bedroom window, not being able to sleep, and sees the frat house. He puts his fists against his hips and heads for the house. He bangs on the door until it opens
Randy
Can I speak with PC Principal please?
PC Bro 5
Oh yeah. We got another one, guys!
PC Bro 6
All right. Bring him in, bro!
PC Bro 7
[voice only] We're ready! Woo! [other PC bros haul him in and change his clothes]
Randy
Hey what? [stands in line with a bunch of other guys] Hey no, I- No, I don't- [he is now wearing a PLEDGE shirt - he is now a pledge for this fraternity]
PC Bro 8
All the pledges take a shot! [the music is cut off, frat bros come in and offers the pledges swigs from various bottles of liquor]
PC Principal
All right pledgies, we're excited. You wanna try and be PC. We hope you've got what it takes to join the most socially active group in America.
PC Bros
Weoooh!
PC Principal
You know, there's still some people out there that say "What does being PC really mean?" Well, I'll tell you what it means. It means you love nothin' more than beer, workin' out, and that feelin' you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression.
PC Bros
Wooo! Yeah! Dude, let's go! Woowooo! Yeah!
Randy
[takes a swig] Yeah!
PC Bros
Wooohooo!
Randy
[shakes his head vigorously] Wooo-ooo!
PC Bros
Wooohooo! let's go! Yeah!
The Marsh house, early morning. Randy comes down the stairs slowly, painfully. He stops a moment to address a headache. He makes his way slowly to the kitchen and sits at the breakfast table. He hangs his head and rests it on his right hand. Sharon, arms crossed, has been waiting for him.
Sharon
You got home pretty late last night. Six AM?
Randy
I've joined a social awareness group. It's a coalition that discourages the use of ... words that have negative or offensive connotations... to grant respect to people who are victims of unfair stereotypes.
Sharon
You got in at Six and now you're missing work.
Randy
We've been getting away with horrible things, Sharon. Having- laughs at less privileged people and thinking it was harmless. Our group is... trying to be a civilizing influence... where we discuss and have meetings to better define and reinforce tolerance and acceptance [voice trails off] of all groups of people.
Sharon
Hm... And do they have booze at these meetings?
Randy
Uhhhh... They serve refreshments, yes.
A hospital room, night. Cartman is on a bed hooked up to monitoring equipment. He's got two black eyes, cuts on his arms, and a cast on his right leg. Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kenny stop by
Stan
Cartman?
Cartman
[with raspy voice] We can't beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong.
Butters
What do we do now?
Cartman
There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady.
Butters
[earnestly] Oh no!
Kyle
Dude, if we all tell the police what the principal did, he'll be fired!
Stan
Yeah.
Cartman
No way.
Kyle
Why?
Cartman
Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up.
Kyle
No, you're a bigot.
Cartman
If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with.
Kyle
I'm not going to apologize for saying Caitlyn Jenner isn't a hero! In fact, personally, I think she's most likely not a very good person! [the boys gasp]
Cartman
[In added pain] Aaahh, aahh! [looks left at Kyle] Kyle, believe me! I know the struggle with hatred. Let's make ourselves better people... together. [reaches out to Kyle]
Kyle
Come on, fat-ass.
Cartman
No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter.
Kyle
So you're never gonna call me a dirty Jew again?
Cartman
No. I'm going to call you... my friend.
Kyle
Oh fuck you. [turns around and walks out]
Cartman
I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.
Rho Omega Delta house, night. Randy dances with other bros to "Watch Me (Whip / Nae Nae)" and takes a sip of beer after each dance move
PC Principal
All right, pledges, listen up. Congratulations on making it to the final cuts. [only three pledges are left - Randy and two other men.]
Pledges
Wooohoo! Yeah!
PC Principal
Now it's time for the final test. So what you're gonna have to do, to prove you belong with PC, is go out there, and check someone's privilege.
Pledge 1
Finally!
Pledge 2
Yes!
Randy
I'm sorry, I don't know what that is.
PC Principal
Topher, can you explain "check your privilege" please.
Topher
[PC Bro 1] Uh, it's getting someone to acknowledge their own inherent privileges and reminding them to put them aside in order to better understand another human's plight.
PC Principal
Yeah, see, there's some people out there like Brett fucking Favre who think that when we all stand up and applaud Caitlyn Jenner at the ESPY Awards, he can get away with one of these bullshit claps! [performs a limp clap] It's called "clapping" Favre! What the fuck are you doing?! Washing your hands?! You're either on board, or you're NOT, bro! Now, if he's gonna bring shame on someone, then he can have his privilege checked and have a little shame brought down on him!
Randy
You want me to shame Brett Favre?
PC Principal
[stops to stare at Randy] No. 'Cause there's somebody even worse now.
Kyle's room, night. He's asleep, and we quickly find out who could be worse then Brett Favre. On the inner side of the bed is Randy, and on the window side are the two pledges who were with him for the final cut. One 3 the three men shake Kyle's bed and blow into noisemakers.
Kyle
AAAAHH! What the fuck, dude?! What the fuck?! [A few seconds later the men rush out of the room as he watches them leave. Then he looks down and sees pigs all over the floor. Each one has the word "Biggit" painted on.]
Cartman's hospital room. He begins to dream of a football game. He's dressed as Tom Brady, with his back to the camera. His voice echoes throughout the dream
Cartman Brady
[turns around] I may be down, but I'm not out. Tom Brady's never out!
Commissioner Cartman
You broke the rules!
Cartman Brady
Fuck you, "I broke the rules"! YOU're breaking the rules!
Commissioner Cartman
Fuck you, you broke the rules!
Cartman Brady
You broke the rules, how you found out I broke the rules!
Coach Cartman
Yeah, you broke the rules!
Commissioner Cartman
I'm the commissioner! I can break the rules 'cause you guys broke the rules before! I didn't bust you enough!
Coach, Brady
Just because you didn't bust us enough for breakin' the rules, that doesn't mean you can break the rules bustin' us now!
Commissioner Cartman
Fuck both you guys! I can do whatever I want! I'm breakin' the rules!
Cartman Brady
Fuck you, I'm Tom Brady!
Commissioner Cartman
Fuck you, I'm the commissioner! I'll make up new rules!
Coach, Brady
Fuck your rules!
Commissioner Cartman
Fuck you guys, always fucking rules!
Cartman Brady
Fuck all the rules! [all this wakes Cartman up]
Cartman
Ack! Butters!
Butters
I'm here, Eric.
Cartman
Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?
Butters
Yes Eric.
Cartman
I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.
The Marsh house, day. The doorbell rings and Stan rushes to the door to see who it is. When he opens the door, he sees Kyle with a tree stuck on his back and penises drawn all over his face.
Kyle
Will you please tell your dad to leave me alone?
Stan
Dude, what happened?
Kyle
[steps inside, tree and all] Your dad was on my lawn yelling at me all night, and after I finally fell asleep I woke up Saran-wrapped to a tree with penises on my face. And this. [removes his hat to reveal his hair gathered into four crude ponytails, one of them covered in a condom. Stan is stunned, but takes it in]
Stan
Hang on. [walks to the kitchen] Dad, did you draw dicks on my friend's face?
Randy
[back at the kitchen table, with a hangover, like last time] Did I check his privilege? Yes. I had some refreshments and I checked your friend's privilege.
Stan
That's my best friend, Dad! Stop shaming him because you want to fit in!
Randy
Stan, straight white males in a capitalistic society have little- understanding of victimization compared to injustices against the underprivileged. Dicks on your face is a very first-world problem. [the liquor comes back into his mouth] Oh shit! [vomits as he heads toward the sink]
Stan
[returns] Look, Kyle, maybe you should just say Caitlyn Jenner is a hero.
Kyle
I didn't even say she wasn't a hero! I just said she isn't a hero to me! I didn't like Bruce Jenner as a person when he was on the Kardashians, and I don't suddenly like him now!
A passing bro
Weoo-weoo-weoo-weooh!
Stan
Her.
Kyle
HER, yes!
Cartman's hospital room. Cartman is on his feet, stumbling
Cartman
OH. Eh, oh it's no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making positive changes, but I... can barely even walk. [thinks a moment] How is everybody doing?
Butters
Well they're fine. Everyone's just kind of keepin' their mouths shut. It's kinda nice. [smiles] So the PC guys are leavin' people alone. Well, except for...
Cartman
Who?
Butters
Well, well now they've made Kyle their main target.
Cartman
[soft music plays] ...Kyle? ...My friend Kyle? [begins removing his hospital clothes slowly and replacing them with his own clothes]
Butters
Eric, what are you doing?
Cartman
I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.
Butters
Oh, but I thought you agreed with them.
Cartman
I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don't agree with his hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn Jenner's a stunning hero, [clears his throat] but that doesn't mean I'll stand by while Kyle's intolerance is dealt with violently. We're going to war with these PC people once and for all! Butters, I'm going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers.
Butters
Well ohhh-kay!
Rho Omega Delta house, night. The PC bros have gathered around a door entrance, and begin chanting...
PC Bros
Social Justice 1 2 3 Woowoo!
I wanna be PC Woowoo!
It's just the way to be for me!
And you!
Woowoo!
Your hateful slurs are through! Woowoo!

PC Bro 9
I call woowoo on you!

PC Bros
Woowoo! We'll fight until you're PC black and blue!

Randy
Woowoo!

PC Bros
Woowoo!We are language police fighting bigotry!
Hurtful words can suck our turds, 'cause it's PC for me!</i>

PC Bro 5
And you!
PC Bros
Woowoo! Yeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah!
PC Bro 5
Fuck yeah, bro! PC bro! [Cartman is now on the scene, walking with a crutch and a walkie-talkie.]
Cartman
All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! [Butters, with a semaphore flag in each hand, gives the signal for the women to rush the house]
Pregnant Mexican Women
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
PC Bro 5
Fuck, bro?! [Cartman stops by the taco launchers, which are manned by Clyde, Craig, and Tweek]
Cartman
Fire the taco launchers! [the boys load the launchers and let fly. Tacos rain down upon the frat house. The women arrive and run into the house, picking up tacos on the way] Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! [a truck load of Syrian refugee children is waiting for the truck bed to empty out. Butters releases the cargo door and the kids flood out towards the house]
PC Bro 2
Dude, what is this, bro?!
PC Bro 6
I don't know, bro!
Cartman
[looking through some binoculars] The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! [Jared appears with his arms stretched out, ready to grab anything. He follows the women and the kids into the frat house, but doesn't grab anyone. The rest of the neighborhood gathers and marches towards the house]
Stephen
What in the world is going on??
Cartman
All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos. [sees Jared on the balcony trying to grab some kids, and some bros stop Jared] Jared needs backup, send in the Chinese drivers. [a split second later two cars crash into each other in front of the house.]
A PC Bro
[falls from the balcony to his death] Ohhh! [lands on his head]
Cartman
All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! Gimme a- Oh fuck, there's Kyle. [lowers his binoculars] What the fuck are you doing, Kyle?
Kyle
Enough! Stop! Everyone STOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHP! [The camera shows his head bigger than usual and the air brighter then usual. His voice echoes across town and everyone stops in their tracks. A pregnant woman picks up a taco and runs off with it.] This is so wrong! I can't let it continue! This is not ever what I intended! I just want to say... Caitlyn Jenner is a hero. There's no other way to say it. What she did took bravery, and she is absolutely stunning. [Moments later, PC Principal steps forward and begins clapping. Once the clapping reaches normal speed, others begin to join in. A live-action shot of Brett Farve at the ESPYs "limp-clapping" is even thrown in]
Townsman
Wooo.
South Park, the dawn of a new day. Everyone gathers in the school cafeteria, which has a sign at the entrance: WELCOME TO 2015 SOUTH PARK. Inside, people are having conversations, kids are running around, Randy's butt is getting branded...
Randy
Ow, hot. Hot hot, hothohhht. [PC Bro 4 takes the branding iron off, and Randy is officially a PC Bro. He stands up and gets dressed.] Ahhh.
PC Principal
I gotta hand it to you, Marsh. You really checked that little boy's privilege. Using those Syrian refugees was genius, bro.
PC Bro 4
Yeah. I would have never thought to use offensive imagery and outrageous stereotypes to provoke someone to open their eyes.
Randy
So I'm PC now?
PC Principal
You're not only PC, you've actually changed my PC. [whips out some sunglasses] Congrats. Here's your Oakleys.
Randy
Oh wow. Oakleys! [puts them on and his voice changes] Oh yeah bro, these are sweet. [The big five stand nearby observing the small ceremony]
Stan
So I guess PC Principal is here to stay, huh?
Cartman
Yes. But at least we showed him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue. [Kyle lowers his eyelids and the others back away] What's wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too.
Kyle
It just seems to me like we all lost in this, and that the only person who won was you.
Cartman
Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude. [Cartman hums his own version of the end theme song over the credits.]
End of Stunning and Brave

Where My Country Gone?
The White House, day. President Obama delivers a speech in the East Room to the press
President Obama
Now, last week we were all reminded that intolerance still exists in our country. It took a very special young student to light up social media, and we've invited him to the White House today to show our appreciation. Because never have there been more tolerant, more moving words than Kyle Broflovski's speech about his hero Caitlyn Jenner. [applause. Kyle is shown with his eyes half-closed - an indication that he doesn't want to be there.] Come on up here, Kyle.
Crunchy's Micro Brew, during the speech. Mr. Garrison is seated with Mr. Adler and Jimbo at a table looking at a TV monitor above the bar.
Mr. Garrison
You see?? There! This is why it's happening! Everyone's preachin' openness and acceptance, and so now millions of goddamned immigrants are comin' over the border and nobody seems to care!
Mr. Adler
Well what are you gonna do? In today's world it's like you can't even say anything negative about illegal immigrants.
Randy
[Approaching and gesturing like a siren] Weoo weoo weoo weoo weoo! Did somebody over here say "illegal immigrants"? Because the correct term is "undocumented immigrants," alright bro? [leaves]
Mr. Garrison
[hushed] It's like nobody cares! And they just keep comin'. Crossin' the border with their dirty families, playin' their stupid music! [looks to his left] I mean, look at 'em! I'll bet not ONE of them is here legally! [a group of Canadians is playing pool.]
Canadian 1
Alright guy!
Canadian 2
Hey buddih!
Canadian 3
Hey buddih!
Canadian 4
[the shooter] Hey, what's going on fwiend!
Canadian 5
[Wearing a Canada sweater] Hey, buddih! Another Moosehead, eh?
Mr. Garrison
We should have put up a goddamned wall. [Jimbo and Richard now look at the Canadians as well]
President Obama
But wait, there's still more, [the three man now look at the TV] because this country was built on dreamers, and Kyle, we want to make your dreams come true. And so here is your hero, Caitlyn Jenner. [applause as Caitlyn joins Barack and Kyle at the podium. Kyle is taken aback]
Caitlyn Jenner
[with a lisp] I just wanna say thank you Kyle for your beautiful words of support.
President Obama
Now Kyle, we've got another little surprise for you. We told you we were flying you back home, but the truth is, you're getting a ride back all the way with your hero! How do you like that?! [Ooohs and applause follow.]
Caitlyn Jenner's car, outside, moments later. She's ready to take Kyle home, while Kyle looks bewildered.
Caitlyn Jenner
Buckle up, buckaroo! [Revs up and speeds away. Almost immediately an elderly person crosses her path and she runs her over, thoroughly killing her under her wheels. The press applauds.]
South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Garrison enters his classroom along with his students.
Mr. Garrison
Okay children, let's take our seats. As you've probably noticed, our government has decided to let anyone who wants to, cross the border and screw up our country! [before him is a crowded room, with more desks and lots of new Canadian students.] I know you're all as pissed off as I am, so why don't we begin today's lesson on why the once-great empire of Rome, fell to shit! Huh?! Who can tell my why Rome fell to shit?! [all the Canadian kids raise their hands] No, somebody who matters! [the Canadian students begin to clamor. Garrison puts his left hand over his nose and closes his eyes] Alright, fine, in the orange shirt.
Canadian Kid 1
[orange shirt] The Roman Empire, buddy, was facing ehh several issues, guy, as they reached the new millennium, friend, and rather-
Mr. Garrison
[irritated] Oh, speak in English! You see, [turns around and begins writing on the board] what happened is that these immigrants called Goths [writes the word and circles and underlines it] were welcomed into Roman territories [writes the word Roman on the board] because some people felt bad for them. [another Canadian boy checks his watch and hops off his seat, opens a small case and pulls out a trumpet] And then the Goths suddenly decided they were being oppressed, you see, and so then- [the boy begins to play a familiar tune, and Mr. Garrison turns around] What the hell are you doing?! [the other Canadian kids get out of their seats and whip out their trumpets to play the song]
Canadian Kid 2
[in a suit] It's 8am, guy.
Mr. Garrison
[loses his temper,throws his notes and chalk] Well that's it! Why don't you Canucks go back where you came from?! [they stop and look aghast at him]
The Principal's office, moments later. PC Principal is behind his desk with Mr. Mackey at his right side. PC Principal is barely containing his temper. Mr. Garrison is looking at him defiantly with arms crossed
PC Principal
You really think you can refer to an undocumented immigrant as a "Canuck"?!
Mr. Garrsion
PC Principal, they got up in the middle of my lecture and started playing music!
PC Principal
So did you forget that at eight and eleven all Canadians face east and play Chuck Mangione? [stands up and puts his hands on the desk] Or did you not care to find out about their religious customs?
Mr. Garrsion
Thuh, they don't even speak English!
PC Principal
Then you need to be teaching in both languages from now on! Mackey, sign the faculty up for Canadian-language night classes!
Mr. Garrsion
What?!
Mr. Mackey
[bowing profusely] Yes, PC Principal! R-right away! M'kay?
PC Principal
You're on thin ice, Garrison! Get in line or you'll be out of a job, bro!
South Park Elementary cafeteria, lunchtime. Cartman, Kenny, Butters, and Token bring lunches from home while Stan, Kyle, Clyde and Craig get school lunches
Stan
What are they doing now? [several tables have Canadian kids seated and eating. Butters stands up for a better look]
Butters
Well they're all eatin' together and praying. A-and they're puttin' syrup on their Mac & Cheese! [sits back down]
Clyde
Ugh, so weird!
Token
There's just so many of them.
Cartman
You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy.
Token
Whattaya mean?
Cartman
Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
Kyle
[annoyed] I'm sitting right here.
Cartman
And he's sitting right here.
Kyle
You really think just my speech brought on a wave of illegal immigration?!
Stan
You did kind of go overboard, dude.
Kyle
[looks at Stan, betrayed] What?!
Stan
It's just... I know you like giving speeches and stuff, but not everything is black and white.
Clyde
Yeah, I mean, it's fine you wanna go preach about Caitlyn Jenner, but you can't just make blanket statements about letting anyone do whatever they want.
Kyle
I didn't even want to give that speech!
Cartman
[interrupting] Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four?
Butters
Uhn-un.
Cartman
Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now.
Kyle
Uh I'm not responsible for this! Illegal immigration has been happening forever.
Cartman
But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
Kyle
You guys, immigrants, either legal or illegal, are always gonna find ways to cross into richer countries if they're not living-
Stan
[briefly puts his left hand over his nose] Oh boy, here we go again. [the other boys leave as well]
Cartman
Yeah, I'm out.
Butters
Yeah, sorry. I can't listen to another one either. [Kyle is left alone, bewildered]
South Park Elementary, a different classroom, evening. There are watermarks everywhere, so this room hasn't been used for a while
Mr. Stkrdknmibalz
Happy evening, friends. My name is Mr. Stkrdknmibalz, (stick-yer-dick-in-my-balls) and we are going to learn Canadian. [Garrison shifts in his seat] With a lot of practice, you're going to find that speaking Canadian isn't so difficult. And in fact, our alphabet and yours are fairly similar. So why don't we begin singing it together? [Clears his throat]
A B C D E F Guy
H I J K L M N O Buddih

These are Canadian ABCs
Susie likes hairy balls. Whattaya think of these?

Alright, now everyone!

[Mr. Garrison begins to daydream]
Montage: Mr. Garrison on a bridge overlooking a river. he sees several Canadians enjoying themselves in inner tubes in the river. He sighs and walks away. Next, he's in line to get into the DMV during the day, but the line is full of Canadians. Next, new STOP signs go up that now have BUDDY under the STOP. Mr. Garrison is at the intersection waiting for the green light. A truck pulls up with a bunch of kids in the truck bed, no seat belts. Next, he's at the old town bar singing on a corner stage and playing a guitar. The regulars hold up their fists in solidarity. Next, he passes by a food cart. The cook there is selling beaver tails for five dollars. Then he passes by a newly-sold house with a Canadian couple cheering their purchase. Then he's back at the bar, with more listeners holding up lighters in solidarity. Next, he looks out his window and finds a bunch of supporters on his lawn pleading for him to lead them. Next, he walks by some Canadian kids playing street hockey, then he passes by the school
Mr. Garrison
Where has my country gone?
Where has my country gone?
It was a land of opportunity that we held dear
But now all these other assholes are comin' here.
And where's my country gone?
It was just here like, two seconds ago.
'Cause when they said that this was the land of the free
I'm pretty sure that they were referring to me
And my country's gone!
It got upset and now it's wandered away
It took 43 Presidents to make us stand tall
And just one black guy to unravel it all
Country gone!
Please tell it that we need her back home.
There's a great big hole in the liberty bucket
'Cause someone forgot to tell the foreigners to suck it!
And now they're all hanging out on my lawn... [trumpets come up and play "Feels So Good"]
And now they're ruining my song
Makin' it sound like Chuck Mangione [trumpets fade out]
Where has my country gone?

Montage ends, and the camera settles on Mr. Garrison leading a rally at the town square, with his supporters around him.
Mr. Garrison
Seems like everyone's afraid to speak the truth around here! Well I'm throwin' my hat in and sayin' I'll figure this thing out! Now I might not understand politics, or immigration policies, or... the law. Or basic... ideological... concepts. But dammit I understand there there's a bunch of Canadians here and I'm gonna do somethin' about it! [applause and cheers]
South Park Elementary gymnasium. PC Principal has called the student body in and put the Canadians on the basketball court and the Americans on the bleachers. The Canadian kids are standing in two lines. The front line wear different costumes that represent different time periods and icons in Canadian history, including the First Settlers of Canada, foreign explorers, a Mountie and a Canadian soldier. The second line consists of a band and choir.
PC Principal
Alright everyone, listen up. In order for better understanding we've asked students of Canadian origin to introduce you to their culture and [spots a disturbance in the stands] HEY LESLIE! SHUT YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! [Leslie stops whispering into her friend's ear and looks at PC Principal] - to introduce you to their culture and customs. So let's give them our undivided attention as they take us on a whirlwind journey through their diverse history.
Three students dressed in Native American garb
We are the Hopewell and Abenaki, first settlers of Canadian soil--
Kindergartner
Guy.
Five students dressed in European clothing
We are French and British explorers, seeking furs and goods. [Mr. Garrison walks up and takes the mic]
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, and I'm Dan Rather, and I got news for you! Nobody wants you here! [the gym is silent] Sorry not sorry! It's time for someone to say it like it is, and make our country great again!
PC Principal
Garrison, what do you think you're-?
Mr. Garrison
And I'm also not afraid to stand up to PC Principal! You, sir, have a pizza face and you suck your mom's dick!
PC Principal
That's it Garrison! You are fired from South Park Elementary!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, see? And now I'm fired! That's the cold, hard truth of immigration! Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's fuck 'em all to death! [the students gasp] I'm just sayin' what everyone's thinkin' here kids!, Sorry not sorry![The school hallway, moments later. The Canadian kids walk out of school in anger]
Stan
Dude, the Canadians are pissed off.
Token
Can you really blame them?
Butters
What made Mr. Garrison do that?
Cartman
Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock!
Butters
You really think Kyle would do that?
Stan
That doesn't matter. We have to think of a way to smooth this over, fast.
Cartman
Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union.
Token
A what?
Cartman
You know, what's that story about the two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together?
Butters
Lion King II?
Cartman
[snaps his fingers and points to Butters] Yes, Lion King II. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along.
Craig
Yeah, it's kind of like when the princess of one country marries the prince of another.
Kyle
Oh, come on, this is stupid. You guys, when two groups of people don't understand each other you can't just try and diffuse the tension with a little-
Cartman
Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now? [all quiet] Is he SERIOUSLY giving a speech right now?! [the other boys look back at Kyle angrily, and Kyle is left speechless] This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it.
Stan, Craig, Kenny, Clyde, Token
[one after the other] Not it!
Butters
No, no. Not it! Oh. OH SHIT!
CNN report.
Anchor Tom
Support is growing for a Colorado man who claims the way to deal with illegal immigrants is to fuck them all to death. We go live to Minnesota.
Niagara Falls, Minnesota, day. Mr. Garrison goes around greeting supporters and waving to them or the camera
Field Reporter
Tom, the political activist is going around the country to get support for his agenda, and- Uh Mr. Garrison, you believe the immigration problem is easy to solve?
Mr. Garrison
Yes. Fuck them all to death. Let'a make this country great again. [cheers swell from his supporters]
Field Reporter
And when you say "Fuck them all to death," what are you actually suggesting be done?
Mr. Garrison
I'm suggesting we round them all up, pull down their pants, and fuck them until their spirits leave their bodies!
Supporter 1
[wearing a Snap Right Tools cap] USA!
Mr. Garrison
And then, after we've fucked every last one of 'em to death, we build a big wall! And if anyone comes over the wall, we fuck them to death too! And then we fuck to death all the-
Tom
Uh Dan? Dan? We're getting word that a wall has already been built. [to the control booth] Is that right? Yes? Yeah- CNN is confirming that Canada has built a wall to keep us out.
Mr. Garrison
What do you mean they built a wall?! They can't build a fucking wall! Oh, fuck them to death!
[Moments later, Garrison and his supporters rush to the border in their cars, where they are met with a very tall wall. A lone guard sits atop the 40-foot wall, and the Americans get out of their cars]
Guard
Hey there! Beautiful day, isn't it?
Mr. Garrison
What the hell is this?!
Guard
Oh this? This is a wall. Sorry buddih, nobody allowed in.
Jimbo
Can they do that?
Mr. Garrison
Look, we came to speak with your government about that
Guard
Yeah, no, sorry! Everything past here is ours. You can't, you can't go past, past here.
Mr. Garrison
We're Americans! We don't even want to be over there! What do you think we're gonna do?
Guard
Well, you know, we just don't want you ... raping our women and stuff.
Supporter 2
That is ridiculous! [crosses his arms]
Mr. Garrison
All right, smartass! That's just about enough-
Guard
Look, there's just some really cool shit back here and we don't feel like sharing it.
Mr. Garrison
[suddenly curious] Cool shit like what?
Guard
Don't worry aboot it.
Mr. Garrison
No! What's back there? Let me see!
Jimbo
[pulling him back] It's all right, Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
No! Goddammit, let me see!
South Park Elementary playground, day. The Americans and Canadians have separated into their own cliques. Cartman and Butters stand between the groups checking out the Canadian girls. Butters is still pissed that he lost
Cartman
What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot.
Butters
She's not hot! She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it!
Cartman
All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh?
Butters
Alanis Morissette is like 80 years old or something! [stomps his right foot down on the snow] Jeez!
Cartman
Okay, Bu-Butters, relax.
Butters
Well I don't want a Canadian girlfriend, Eric!
Cartman
Okay. Do you just want a race war?
Butters
No! The one in the white shoes isn't that ugly.
Cartman
Okay, go fuck the one in the white shoes.
Butters
Okay! [walks over to the bench with the girl in white shoes next to it] Hi, my name's Butters, what's yours.
Charlotte
I'm Charlotte. [her friends giggle]
Butters
Oh Charlotte, I've never done this before. You think Scar's up there? He wasn't my father, but he's still part of me. Oh no, Simba, we have barely begun. We'll run away together and ... and...?
Cartman
[satisfied with the way Butters interaction is playing out. To himself] And start a pride all of our own.
CNN Report, at the Canadian border. Dan, the field reporter, is updating
Dan
Tom, the scene at the Canadian border is electric as several political leaders try and strategize how to deal with being shut out of Canada. [in the background three podiums appear on the road right in front of the wall. Garrison and two other leaders step up to the mics.]
Male politician
If the Canadian government wants to put up a wall, they have every right.
Female politician
And yet, we must ask why they thought this to be necessary.
Mr. Garrison
No, fuck them and fuck you! [points at the female politician] I wanna see if they have really cool shit back there!
Female politician
What we need is a-
Mr. Garrison
No! [points at the female politician] You've got a gaping gash [points at the male politician] and you've got vinegary balls! The Canadians can't do this! Don't they realize that hundreds of thousands of their people are over here illegally?
Guard
Oh, you guys didn't put up a wall?
Mr. Garrison
And you keep your goddamned mouth shut, smart-ass! I'll deal with you! [cheers and applause from his supporters. He turns to face them.] I get things done, and I'm gettin' back there! [more cheers and applause]
An outdoor mall in South Park. Butters returns with some ice cream for himself and Charlotte.
Butters
Here you go.
Charlotte
Thanks, Butters. I'm sore-y I didn't know what ice cream was.
Butters
What's "sore-y"?
Charlotte
Well that's what Canadians say to express remorse.
Butters
Oh. Heh, he-hey, heh that's neato. [his cell phone rings] Oh. Eh, hang on Charlotte, one sec. [walks off a bit and picks up] What do you want?!
Cartman
Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet?
Butters
No, we saw a movie and now we're goin' to the park.
Cartman
Butters, we don't have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the chase with a Hot Cosby!
Butters
If I'm gonna be with this girl, I don't want her someday thinking it was all super-rushed!
Cartman
Nobody cares about forty years from now when she suddenly changes her mind, Butters! Time is of the essence! We're all gonna die! [hangs up. Butters returns to Charlotte]
Charlotte
Everything all right?
Butters
Yeah, just some work-related stuff.
Charlotte
So hey, I wanted to see if you wanted to come over to my house for dinner tomorrow.
Butters
[getting nervous] Oh boy, yes I'd love to, here we go, oh God.
Niagara Falls National Park. The camera looks at the falls and then pans to the left to show Mr. Garrison being lowered into a barrel by Jimbo and Ned.
Mr. Garrison
Okay that's, that's good. Watch the balls. Okay, all right, give me the helmet. [Jimbo reaches down and hands the helmet to Mr. Garrison] We'll see what they've got behind that goddamned wall! [turns around to face his supporters] You know what I am, friends? I'm a doer.
Supporters
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Mr. Garrison
Canada says we can't go into their country, I'm going into their country! And when I do, I am fucking every last Canadian... so hard! [cheers and applause] All right, let's do this! [drops down into the barrel. Jimbo and Ned seal it up. Several supporters lift the barrel up over their shoulders and carry it to the railing]
Supporters
USA USA USA USA USA! [they throw it into the river and watch it approach the falls] USA USA USA! [the barrel goes over the falls and breaks up a few seconds later. Jimbo screams] USA US-!
Jimbo
Aww, he's dead.
Charlotte's house, evening. Butters is her guest for dinner. She has a grandmother living with her, as well as a brother and sister
Dad
So young man, I understand that you and my daughter have started a romance.
Butters
Well uh, well yes, sir.
Dad
And I suppose you have a thing for Canadian girls, huh? Is that it? You've got maple fever?
Charlotte
Ey, daddy!
Dad
I'm sore-y, Charlotte, but I get suspicious. It's bad enough we have to live in America, now all the boys with maple fever are gonna wanna have at our daughter.
Mom
That's enough, Thomas!
Butters
W-wait, you don't wanna be here?
Charlotte
Why would we want to be here?
Butters
Wuh well, you know, 'cause everything is great here, and we have cool stuff.
Thomas
Canada has everything. It's the greatest country on Earth.
Butters
But- so- then, why did you leave?
Thomas
[sighs and gets up from the his chair, and walks over to a window] There were several candidates during the Canadian elections. One of them was this brash asshole who just spoke his mind. He didn't really offer any solutions, he just said outrageous things. we... thought it was funny. [the mom begins to cry quietly, and her son comforts her] Nobody really thought he'd ever be President. It was a joke! But we just let the joke go on for too long. He kept gaining momentum, and by the time we were all ready to say "Okay, let's get serious now. Who should really be President?" he was already being sworn into office. [turns around] We weren't paying attention. [collapses and begins to cry, bumping into the table against the window] We weren't paying attention! [lets out all his tears and the family gathers around him to comfort him.]
Butters
Jeez, how bad can a president be?
Back in Canada, the new President, a middle-age man resembling a likeness to Donald Trump, sits at his desk.
Mr. President
If certain people want to leave this country, then let them! You tell those pussy homos they can suck my balls!
Johnson
But Mr. President-
Mr. President
And tell the Prime Minister of China that HE can suck my balls! Oh, and Johnson?
Johnson
Mr. President?
Mr. President
Suck my balls.
Charlotte's backyard, after dinner. The yard is more like a garden, with flowers everywhere, swaying gently in the breeze. She and Butters are on a bench swing holding hands
Charlotte
I'm sore-y about my papa. He can be really emotional sometimes.
Butters
You don't got to be sore-y. It's me who should be sore-y. I think everyone has the wrong idea about your people, Charlotte.
Charlotte
It's okay. We just have to give them time.
Butters
I wasn't supposed to have time. I was supposed to give you a Hot Cosby, so our species could coexist. But now I realize you guys don't even wanna be here.
Charlotte
Oh.. so do you want to be here? Now?
Butters
There's really nowhere I'd rather be. [smiles] If it's okay with you, well I'd like to try a nice Slow Cosby instead.
Charlotte
In Canada, we call a Slow Cosby ... love. [kisses Butters on the cheek. Butters strokes it and smiles again] Oh look! [a meteorite zooms across the sky] A shooting star! In Canada, we say that's... good luck.
Butters
So do we.
A concrete channel with a slow-moving river running through it on the Canadian side of the border. Mr. Garrison comes to, groans, and slowly gets up. He leaves the channel and finds himself looking at an abandoned Canadian city.
Mr. Garrison
Hello? [his voice echoes through the canyon of high-rises in the city. He walks by an empty coffee shop with a loose door banging in the wind. He hears a man sobbing, but sees abandoned cars, paper strewn everywhere, trash... he finds the man sitting on the roof of a 13-story law office building]
Man
Oh God! Oh God!
Mr. Garrison
Hey! Where is everyone, guy? [the man sobs some more and then stands and jumps to his death.] Jeez.
Montage. As "Safety Dance" plays, Mr. Garrison walks through an empty mall and notices an escher-esque assortment of escalators there. Mr. President is dancing away. Mr. Garrison sees the activity and walks over, not sure what to make of it all. Mr. President notices him and stops
Mr. President
What?! Hey! How did a US citizen get past my wall?!
Mr. Garrison
I came here to find out where my country gone!
Mr. President
Where your country gone? Where my country gone?!
Mr. Garrison
No, where my country gone, bitch?!
Mr. President
Nobody talks to me like that, buddih! [goes around his desk]
Mr. Garrison
Nobody talks to me like that, fwiend! [they begin to fight on the carpet. Mr. Garrison takes the President down and wrestles with him until the President is face down] Eurgh! Yeah?
Mr. President
Stupid-! Unh!
Mr. Garrison
Little asshole!
Mr. President
This is why I built that wall!
Mr. Garrison
You think you can-? [grabs the back of the President's head and slams it down] Hey! Here you go! Here you go! [keeps beating the President down] Look, guy, I came here to do one thing! [takes off his own swim suit and begins raping the President]
Mr. President
Hey, what the-? Aah! Hey, that pokes, buddih! Aah!
Aide
Oh my God, guy.
Mr. President
Please! Please, I can't- Oh. NO! No please, NO! NO! [Garrison inhales some poppers, then resumes the raping with increased vigor] Ohhh! Ohhh! Nooo!
Charlotte's house, the dining table. Butters and Charlotte share a tall milk shake. Thomas and his wife look on from the doorway, holding hands
Mom
Oh look at them, Thomas. I think they really like each other.
Thomas
Yes, I have to admit. It seems they're falling in Slow Cosby. [someone knocks on the front door] I'll get it. [goes to the front door and opens it]
Canadian 6
Hey, did you hear the news, buddih? The Canadian Presidents been fucked to death!
Canadian 7
[across the street] Yes! Yes!
Thomas
What? Are you sure?
Mom
What is it, Thomas?
Thomas
The Canadian President got fucked to death, darling.
Mom
Oh my goodness! Should we go back to Canada then?
Thomas
Yes, I guess let's go back! [and so the Canadians start packing up and moving out. The Marshes stand outside their house looking at the exodus]
Canadians
See ya! Bye! It's been real, guy! See ya, guy! [once they're all gone, Butters appears on the road chasing after Charlotte]
Butters
Charlotte!
Charlotte
I'll Skype you when I'm home, my love! [soon she's too far away]
Butters
Ah, I should have done the Hot Cosby.
South Park town square. Mr. Garrison is back on stage, his supporters cheering and applauding him again
Supporter 3
[voice only] You did it, Garrison!
Supporter 4
[voice only] Thank you, Garrison!
Mr. Garrison
Friends. I think I've proven that my policies work to get things done. I know what my true calling is, and I'm gonna keep this goin' all the way to Washington.
Kyle
[gets up on stage to clear his name] Hold on, wait! It wasn't me! I wasn't the one who brought the Canadians here! It was something just like this. Don't you see? If there's anything we've learned, it's that we have to stop this kind of sensationalist politics before the same thing happens to us, because if we let this kind of... [stops himself] this... kind of... [the crowd looks at him, annoyed]
Cartman
Dude!
Stan
Unbelievable! [Kyle turns left and walks off stage]
Mr. Garrison
All right, my friends. I have to say goodbye now, because I'm off to Washington with my running mate! [the camera shows whom the running mate is as Garrison gets into the passenger seat]
Caitlyn Jenner
Buckle up, buckaroo! [Revs up and speeds away. Almost immediately a young woman crosses her path and she runs her over, thoroughly killing her under her wheels. The crowd cheers and applauds.]
End of Where My Country Gone?

The City Part of Town
The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Fallon is going into his monologue
Jimmy Fallon
Okay okay okay. So this guy is running for President and he hates immigrants, and he's basically an idiot. [the audience laughs throughout] Not surprisingly, this guy is from a predominantly white town called South Park, Colorado. Or Shit-heads of America, Incorporated, I'm not sure. Yeah, if this guy is the best their town has to offer, can you imagine who he left behind? [affecting a hick accent] "Oh hey, I'm from South Park! We don't take kindly to respecting human beings!" [a shot of Randy and Sharon watching from the sofa with their jaws dropped] You, you think South Park has a university? "Welcome to South Park University." [a shot of Gerald and Sheila in bed, watching with jaws dropped] "Please open your shotguns and slap your wives!" [a shot of Butters watching the show on the phone, in bed. He's crying quietly] "I live in South Park and my IQ's so low I've got's ta dig for it. Hey, did someone say 'rape?' That's the word for 'clever' here in South Park" [the camera is back on Randy and Sharon]
Randy
[turns off the TV] That's not funny. [gets up and walks away.]
South Park Elementary, day. Kids are walking around in the hallway. Stan goes to his locker as Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman stand in front of the lockers on the other side of the hallway, their heads hanging in shame. Butters joins them, also ashamed, and Stan closes his locker to join them all.
Stan
So not cool. How does someone just rip on us like that?
Kyle
I can't believe Jimmy Fallon hates us. Jimmy Fallon loves everything. Why would he slam our whole town?
Cartman
Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people.
Butters
Wull do you think it's true? Do you think we're really bigoted country bumpkins?
Cartman
No. [steps forward] Hey, we are not bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny's a bumpkin!
Kenny
(Well fuck you, dude!)
Cartman
We don't have junk cars in our yards, that's just your family, Kenny! [Kyle is about to defend Kenny, but Stan speaks up]
Stan
I just hope somebody finds a way to fix this.
South Park City Hall, day, the Mayor's office.
Mayor McDaniels
I've called you all here because South Park has an image problem. Thanks to Mr. Garrison we are now being referred to as the shit-heads of America. One of our more politically sensitive citizens has proposed an idea for this crisis and I'd like you to hear him out.
Randy
[takes the dais as the Mayor steps aside] Hello everyone, I'm Randy Marsh, and I've been PC for almost two weeks now. You know, we've all been making changes to be more socially conscious, but have we really done enough? The truth is, there's something we're lacking as a community, and it's time we all faced it. What this town needs... is a Whole Foods. [a lot of chatter springs up in the audience.] It would instantly validate us as a town that cares about stuff.
Stephen
We couldn't get a Whole Foods to open here.
Randy
And why not?! Huh?! We all just don't believe we could get a Whole Foods! Because we don't believe in ourselves!
Fr. Maxi
Where could it even go?!
Randy
Mayor?
Mayor McDaniels
I'm announcing a plan for SoDoSoPa. [presses a remote control and a picture of the logo comes up.] A new urban development that will turn the most rundown and dilapidated part of our town into a quaint center of artisan shops and cafes.
Randy
Lots of cities are dong this. The area south of Downtown South Park has always been the ugly eyesore of this town. But now, SoDoSoPa... is going to bring in the fresh new vibrancy that Whole Foods can't ignore.
The SodoSoPa site, later. An architect is there with a select group of people, including the Mayor, Johnson, Wendy's mom, Randy, Linda, and three others
Architect
We'll keep the existing structures, but add brick walkways and some quaint white lights. A plaza in the middle will be a place where young couples can play with their toddlers. [a shot of the site, which is Kenny's house, which has warped windows and broken stucco all around. Kenny hears the conversation and peeks out the front window] And it will all be small businesses like artisan cheese shops or noodle houses.
Randy
Oh, this is really exciting. I thought this area was just gonna stay shitty forever. [Kenny walks to the kitchen, where he sees Stuart drinking a beer and reading a magazine.]
Kenny
(Hey Dad, there's these fucking people outside.)
Stuart
Who is? [gets up and walks to the front door, opens it and sees the group]
Mayor McDaniels
So you think you'll keep all the existing structures?
Architect
I do. It's part of what gives a revitalized area like this its charm that the hipsters like.
Stuart
Hey, what are you people doing?!
Randy
We're gentrifying. It'sall good.
Park County Community Center, day. Another meeting about this project.
Randy
Okay, hold on, everyone listen up! We understand that not everyone is for the town spending money on the SoDoSoPa project. We want everyone to be able to voice their concerns. [Only the McCormicks are present]
Stuart
[stands up] Yeah I got concerns! I don't want you touching my damn house!
Johnson
We realize that when a rejuvenation like this takes place, the lower-income residents fear they'll be priced out of the area.
Stuart
What lower-income residents?! Me?! I work hard and provide for my family just fine!
Randy
Stuart, come on. Your house sucks.
Stuart
Fuck you! If you people wanna turn somethin' into a vibrant arts district, then do it to Randy's house!
Randy
My house is nice.
Aide
Mr. McCormick, you will be living in the most vibrant part of the entire town. SoDoSoPa is the future of South Park.
Johnson
There will be amazing food and incredible shops right at your doorstep.
Mayor McDaniels
And we want to assure the lower-income families that we are going to take the time to do this right.
The SodoSoPa project is now complete, and a new eatery is shown. The Broflovskis and the Stotches are having dinner together
Waiter
Alright guys, welcome to Steed. Do we have any allergies?
Stephen
No, nothing. And we we wanna try everything! [Det. Harris and Officer Barbrady are dining at another table]
Det. Harris
Wow, can you believe this place?
Officer Barbrady
Yeah, the food is unbelievable. [Randy and Nelson are at the bar]
Randy
It's like a dream come true, Nelson. This area is gonna put our town on the map. [the camera pulls back and Steed is shown on the second floor of a mall that has been built on the McCormick house. A narrow entrance between the house and the garage leads to a patio where the backyard used to be, and there are more shops beyond that. Stuart steps outside and dumps his garbage in an aluminum trash can]
City Wok, night. It's empty, and Tuong Lu Kim reflects on the changes in his business. He's smoking and holds a cup in his left hand while ambient Oriental music plays
Tuong Lu Kim
I don't know what happen all my customers. I used to have a-people come in here, fill every table. Now it's like a-nobody want anything to do with my authentic shitty food. This town is changing so fast, you know? [a lone man sits by the window eating dinner. There are no other customers] This town is changing so fast, everybody wan be PC, be updated. It's like I'm a reric. A rost reric from another time. You know? I dunno, sometime I feel like I outstayed my welcome. Is just how I feel, you know?
Diner
Uh huh.
Tuong Lu Kim
It's like a-my accent make people uncomftable or something. How a Chinese man is supposed to survive in this world? [the door opens] Oh, welcome oh Shitty Wok, a take ur order prease?
Man
[turns left and walks up to the diner] Hey Mike, whatcha doin' man? The guys are all meetin' down at SoDoSoPa.
Mike
At what?
Man
They've totally revitalized this area south of Downtown, you've gotta check it out! [turns and walks out]
Mike
Oh sweet, dude. [gets up and follows his friend out the door]
Tuong Lu Kim
SoDoSoPa? What the hell is a SoDoSoPa?
SodoSoPa, moments later. Tuong Lu Kim arrives to see the place for himself
Tuong Lu Kim
What the fuuuck!
SodoSoPa, Kenny's house. All the family is in the living room, bored as the music thumps away around them
Karen
Mommy, can we go eat outside?
Mom
No, we can't go eat outside.
Karen
But Mommy, they have ice cream. [points outside]
Stuart
We can't afford $10 ice cream, alright?! If you want nice things, then go out and get a JOB! Except you won't make MONEY! [Karen gets off the sofa with her head down and goes to her room] Because you just BUST your ASS and then barely get by while everyone around you gets RICHER! [Kenny glares at his dad, then gets up and follows Karen] Just face it: things are never gonna change around here.
The Mayor's office, next day. The mayor and a bunch of townsfolk are waiting on Randy, who's at the desk about to place a call
Johnson
What's he gonna say?
Fr. Maxi
Maybe they won't even answ- [the Mayor shushes them both as Randy waits for a pickup]
Randy
Hi, um, yes, my name is Randy Marsh, and um, we would like to try and get a Whole Foods in our town? ... Yes, that's right. Aaah, yes, it's ah, South Park, Colorado. Nonononono! Nononononono! [continues this for some time] It's not at all what you think! Yes, it's where the Presidential candidate is from-Nonononono! Nononononono! Hold on! Hold on, hold on! SoDoSoPa! SoDoSoPa! We have a SoDoSoPa and the town is completely different! SoDoSoPa! We have an arts and entertainment district! Cultural! Yes. Okay. Okay, yes, I, I understand. Thank you. [hangs up and gathers his thoughts] They said they maybe might send over a representative. [a moment later everyone cheers. Randy hugs the Mayor.]
First commercial, montage of live-action scenes
Voice
[Deep] There's a certain quality, vibe, and energy that is SoDoSoPa. From the independent merchants and unique cafes to the rustic charm of a mixed-income crowd. [the camera pans to Kenny and Stuart, who are annoyed. A couple is dancing at Savor the Goodness as Kevin and Karen look on through a window. Their mom comes up and pulls the blinds down, then back to live action] Where else can you let loose your wild side while still being a part of helping the local economy? [a shot of the whole family looking out at the diners. The parents are mad] And now, a chance to own a piece of this most exciting area of South Park. Announcing: the Lofts at SoDoSoPa. Two thousand square foot of flats that will put you right in the heart of it all. After a night out eating and shopping in SoDoSoPa, just take a few steps and you're home. With modern styling these lofts are sleek, sexy, and oh so SoDoSoPa. And for those very privileged few, the most private and exclusive ownership opportunity is here. Announcing the Residences at the Lofts at SoDoSoPa. Now you can have access to luxury refined while still just steps away from the action. These finely appointed residences all feature state-of-the art finishes and balconies with views of historic Kenny's house. It's a place to laugh. It's a place to gather. A place to mingle with people of all economic classes. And now, it's a place to live. SoDoSoPa. Welcome Home.
South Park, day. Kenny walks down a sidewalk and notices a sign asking for help - child help. He takes it from the window and enter City Wok with it
Tuong Lu Kim
And we are going to take a-business back from a-SoDoSoPa! [notices Kenny with the sign] Ah, hello, you here for job? Prease join the others prease. [he already has a crew of seven kids. Kenny joins the crew] Some say I cannot survive in today's world. But if there's one asset that a Chinese man has, it's the tactical use of a child rabor. And together, child rabor force, we are gong to bring a SoDoSoPa to its knees.
Morning in South Park. New signs are being put up to replace aging ones in Downtown, walls are being painted, flowers bought. Tom is cleaning the windows at his rhinoplasty office, and the town gathers in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty. Bleachers are in place, and the kids take up seats in them
Mayor McDaniels
This is it, people! This is what we've all been working for! The future of our town depends on us being on our best behavior! No swearing, no weirdness, and no speeches! [everyone looks at Kyle, who motions as if to say something]
Johnson
He's coming!
Mayor McDaniels
Go! go! Everyone in place! [all the adults gather by Tom's Rhinoplasty]
Townsman
Oh look! [a female conductor leads the kids in a rendition of "He's Got The Whole World In His Hands" A car pulls up and a Whole Foods Market representative steps out. At this point, the song ends]
Mayor McDaniels
[approaches] Hello, sir. On behalf of everyone here in South Park, please let me say we are very excited to be in consideration-
Whole Foods Rep
[ignores her] Everyone, please go about your business! I need to see this town in its normal goings on, to see if it is indeed a Whole Foods town.
City Wok, day. Mr. Kim's child laborers are hard at work cleaning up the restaurant. A girl is up on a ladder cleaning one of the lanterns
Tuong Lu Kim
[comes in from the left side] Okay, rooking good, child rabor force. [claps three times] We gonna make a Shitty Wok an updated and a beautiful. [heads back towards the kitchen and sings]
Tuong Lu Kim
[comes in from the left side] Okay, rooking good, child rabor force. [claps three times] We gonna make a Shitty Wok an updated and a beautiful. [heads back towards the kitchen and sings]
Let's go child rabor force, let's go! [returns to the dining area] No no, Dennis, you don't use a too much cleaner on the table. That stuff expensive. Now risten everybody! This is a big day! We gonna take the business back from a-SoDoSoPa! And how we gonna do it, child rabor force?! That's right, by taking pride in our work!

Tuong Lu Kim
Oh! Here they come!

Tuong Lu Kim
There they go. [runs to the entrance] Wait, wait! [runs outside] Shitty Wok! Take ur order prease?! Take ur- [quiet voice, as no one comes back] Take ur order ... prease? [a different camera angle shows a Red Lobster across the street from City Wok and Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails down the road.]
South Park Elementary, day. The Mayor gives the Whole Foods representative a tour of the school
Mayor McDaniels
The previous principal of the school was let go so that someone more progressive could take over.
PC Principal
[stands up] Hey bro, I'm the new principal of the school. My name's PC Principal.
Whole Foods Rep
P.C. Principal. I like that. So you've just recently moved here?
PC Principal
That's right.
Whole Foods Rep
And do you believe this town is deserving of a Whole Foods?
PC Principal
You know, I think it's changed a lot. I really do. I've seen some real progress. Definitely had some holdouts - people who went kicking and screaming into 2015, but yes, I think they deserve it.
Whole Foods Rep
Mmmmm-hm. [turns around] Show me a classroom please.
Mr. Garrison's former classroom, Fourth Grade, moments later. A new female teacher is giving the class a lesson. she's sitting on a stool and shows the class some pictures from an open book.
Teacher
But if Pluto isn't a planet, who can tell me what it is? [the door opens and the Mayor and representative walk in] Oh, hello.
Mayor McDaniels
This is our new fourth-grade teacher. She's very normal and professional.
Whole Foods Rep
Please continue as if I am not here.
Teacher
Okay, so uhh children, anyone wanna tell me what Pluto is classified as? [the Whole Foods Rep walks across the floor towards the windows] Anybody? Okay. [the Whole Foods Rep walks back] Well, Pluto is actually a dwarf planet. [Kyle and Stan look at each other] That means it's neither a planet nor a natural satellite, okay?
Whole Foods Rep
[to the Mayor] Is there a reason why the children with disabilities and black child are front and center? ["...like the moon. Who can tell me how big the moon is?"]
Mayor McDaniels
Oh no, that's just where they always sit, next to our beloved Craig there, who is a homosexual. [Craig hears this and looks at her angrily. "Is it bigger? Smaller? Anyone wanna take a guess"]
Whole Foods Rep
Mmmmm-hm.
Mayor McDaniels
Uh, can, can I show you the most exciting part of town?
SoDoSoPa, day. The place is bustling, as usual. The Mayor and the Whole Foods Rep arrive to have a look
Mayor McDaniels
This is historic SoDoSoPa. It's our vibrant and charming arts and foods district. [Kenny is shown coming home from school. He opens the door, sees them, goes inside, and slams the door shut]
Whole Foods Rep
Hmmm, I enjoy how you've retained the lower-income housing with the updated and quaint urban developments.
Mayor McDaniels
That's really what our town is about. [Randy arrives with Stephen]
Randy
Oh, hello again. Stephen and I were just heading to SoDoSoPa to enjoy some specialty foods. [the Whole Foods Rep turns around and looks at the vast open area across the street, and begins to survey it. Randy nudges Stephen a few times]
Whole Foods Rep
Hmmm. I have seen enough for today. I am weary. Where shall I sleep?
Mayor McDaniels
Oh yes, of course, uh...
Randy
Uh, well, tonight, you're at our Motel 6. But, we'd like to show you the plans for something extremely exciting.
Second commercial
Voice
You can't say "excitement" without saying "SoDoSoPa." The food, the art, the nightlife. With the Lofts and Residences at SoDoSoPa all the action was just a few steps away. But what if you could actually live in the most central location that SoDoSoPa has to offer? Well, now you can. Announcing: the Villas at Kenny's House. The most sought-after address in all of South Park for only the very privileged few. Now you can relax in your state-of-the-art deck spa while taking in views of that mixed SoDoSoPa culture. [a view of the back of Kenny's house. Stuart and his wife are fighting, and the new neighbors can see it]
Stuart
Shut your damn mouth, bitch!
Mom
You shut your mouth or I'll shut-
Voice
But that's not all. The Villas at Kenny's house will also feature access to a private fitness center, clubhouse, and so much more. Plus a breezeway to the proposed Whole Foods just steps away. [PROPOSED WHOLE FOODS NOT YET CONFIRMED] The Villas at Kenny's House. Welcome Home.
City Wok, night. Tuong Lu Kim sighs and works the cash register. He counts the day's earnings. Before him is Kenny, the one kid left after the day is done, mopping the floor
Tuong Lu Kim
Hey, that's okay. We close. All the other child labor go home.
Kenny
[stops mopping] (I just wanna make sure I get the floors as clean as I can.)
Tuong Lu Kim
I like you, Dennis. You work a real hard. [hands Kenny a dollar] I wish I could give you more. You deserve more. [walks over to a window] But I think I'm gonna have to shut down. Now that a SoDoSoPa open, I'm the shitty part of town. And everyone hates the shitty part of town.
Kenny
(Yeah. I know what you mean.)
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh, what do you know about living in the shitty part of town, Dennis?
Kenny
[drops the mop] (Hey, I have an idea.)
Tuong Lu Kim
You have idea?
Kenny
(I actually do!)
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh! That's the spirit! Let's go child rabor! [clap clap clapclapclap] Let's go child rabor! [they both clap clap clapclapclap]
A ranch in South Park, day. The the rancher, Mayor, and Whole Foods Rep stand behind a fence
Whole Foods Rep
So these are the cattle that the local shops and restaurants are supplied with.
Rancher
Uh... these are local cows, yes.
Whole Foods Rep
And where does the butchery take place?
Rancher
Uh, that's right over there. [a ranch hand shoots a cow in the head, killing it on the spot]
Whole Foods Rep
And are the bullets made from reclaimed metals?
Mayor McDaniels
I believe they are. Rancher, could you make sure?
Fr. Maxi
Randy, Stephen, we've got a big problem! The owner of City Wok has child labor making videos for him!
Richard
What??
Randy
Oh Jesus! We forgot all about that guy!
Bob
[sees the Whole Foods Rep turn around and nudges Randy] Shhh!
Fr. Maxi
It's all over the place. He's tryin' to revitalize his rundown neighborhood! [the Mayor follows the rep's gaze]
Randy
God, why do the economically challenged always have to screw up everything?! [turns around to face the Mayor] We're gonna head back to SoDoSoPa for some curious fusion delights. [turns around and leads the other three men away] Come on, we'll get that asshole!
Third commercial
Tuong Lu Kim
There's a new and exciting prace where people can gather to shop, experience and grow. This is an all-new food and nightrife district. This, is CtPaTown. Where else but CtPaTown can you get all the shitty hot spots and shitty food that South Park is known for? In the mood for some local seafood? Red Robster has all the freshest from Colorado's many oceans. Or if a handcrafted ale is more your thing, head on down to Skeeter's Bar for local ales like a Coors and a Coors Rite. And then, of course, there's Shitty Wok, South Park's historic Asian fusion randmark, featuring Shitty Chicken and Shitty Sour Soup. The state-of-the-art toiret is designed for men and women [just a regular toilet and bathroom. No urinal] and is a great prace for you to squeeze out all the shitty food you've enjoyed. Now South Park has another neighborhood to mingle and rerax. CtPaTown. Welcome Home.
City Wok, day. Mr. Kim has all his workers there, waiting for the doors to open
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh boy, get ready child rabor force! Any minute now, we gonna have a-customers up our ass!
Townfolk
Get him! There he is! That son of a bitch! Get him! Stop him!
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh boy, here they come! [turns to Kenny] You were right, Dennis! CtPaTown commercial did the trick! [heads back to the counter and turns around] Get ready for customers, child rabor force! [the adults rush in and fan out] Welcome Shitty Wok, take your order PREASE. [Fr. Maxi takes Tuong Lu Kim, Officer Barbrady takes Kenny]
Kenny
(What. The. Fuck?!) [the other adults take the rest of the kids. They all rush out of the restaurant]
Randy
Alright, take these kids and hide them in the-
Kenny
(Come on, dude, I've gotta make some money!)
Randy
Ow! You little-! [kicks Kenny down]
Girl
Get him! [a massive fight breaks out between the adults and the child labor force]
Tuong Lu Kim
Fight, child rabor force! Swing to the reft!
Whole Foods Rep
[shows up with the Mayor and clears his throat] Ahem, ahem! [all the fighting stops and Mayor McDaniels is dismayed at this bad behavior. The adults put the kids down and smile, the kids stay as they are] I've never seen a town put so much energy into displaying an exaggerated sense of social consciousness. Congratulations, you have your Whole Foods. [the adults cheer and disperse.]
Tuong Lu Kim
Wait wait, anybody want a Shitty Chicken?? Anybody?? Take ur order prease??? [jumps a few times in frustration, then sighs] I'm sorry, Dennis. You rearry tried to help. I guess it's over. Come on inside. I'll pay you the child labor wage you deserve.
Kenny's house at SoDoSoPa. Kenny goes home after work. He goes inside his house and passes by the TV, which is showing Hee Haw. The picture tends to flicker between color and black and white
Stuart
[cynically] Well? Did you make any money?
Kenny
[stops and looks down] (No, I didn't make any money.) [continues to the bedrooms]
Stuart
Ha, told ya! That's how it works in this damned country.
A bedroom. Kenny opens the door and looks in. Karen, who is sharing the room with Kevin, sits up in her bed and looks at Kenny
Karen
[whispers as Kenny goes to her bed] What are you doing, Kenny? [Kenny takes off his backpack and opens it, pulling out a blonde Mama Baby doll. He hands it to her and she gasps in anticipation] Wow! This is mine?
Kenny
[pats her knee] (It's yours, Karen.) [closes his backpack and puts it on, then leaves the bedroom. He stops to look at Karen take the doll out of its box]
Karen
Hi. [Kenny closes the door and goes to his own room. He drops the backpack on the floor and goes straight to bed. Life outside at SoDoSoPa bustles on, with the thumping music.]
Fourth commercial. City Wok is still here, but something new is next to it. It's the Whole Foods Market, which shows that CtPaTown got the store, not SoDoSoPa. The Stotches approach the store. A worker turns a sign around so that customers know the store is open. The Blacks are inside checking out loaves of bread. Officer Barbrady has purchased some meat at the meat counter. Gerald is walking a dog while Sheila pulls Ike around in a Radio Flyer. Kyle helps out. A young man passes Dr. Mephesto on a bike and waves hi to him. Darryl Weathers passes in front of Liane on his own bike. They wave hello to each other, smiling. Randy carries Stan, who is pointing out something to him
Voice
There's a time when a town becomes more than it was. [Someone pours himself some coffee. Butters and Linda look at cakes. Mr. Mackey is chatting with the Mayor] When the people take that bold step into making things better. [a bearded worker glances at the camera. Craig points out some deli meats to him mom] To progress. [a shot of two child workers and their mother] To change. [another child worker and his parents] To not be what you were in the past. [a boy and his parents. Wendy glides by on her skateboard] This is a new place, ready for the next decade. [Sharon and Linda walk out with groceries] Updated, revitalized, [Kenny opens his front door and looks out. SoDoSoPa is abandoned, its signs falling down] and ready to fit in with the most progressive towns in America. [PC Principal lowers his Oakleys a bit and nods at the camera] This... is South Park. [a shot of the Mayor and Randy, with a few families, facing the camera at Whole Foods. Cartman and Kyle are in the background] Welcome Home.
Cartman
Are the Mexicans actually staying?
Kyle
Shhhh.
End of The City Part of Town

You're Not Yelping
Morning in CtPaTown, renamed Shi Tpa Town. A bright sun rises over City Foods. People mill around all over the area. The Stotches walk past Skeeter's Wine Bar while the Tuckers, without Craig, walk towards Whole Foods. In the parking area in front of the store two old friends greet each other
Gerald
Mornin' Randy!
Randy
Mornin' Ger! Just another day in paradise, huh?
Gerald
Yeah. Look at all the new restaurants the Whole Foods has brought in. [turns around and points at the restaurant behind them.] Let's try out that one there. [they walk towards it and reach the entrance. A greeter awaits them]
(vernacular)
Randy
Hi. Two of us. please?
Greeter
Yeah, sorry guys. we got about a thirty minute wait.
Gerald
[switches places with Randy] Oh, uh, scuse me. [whispers into the greeter's ear]
Greeter
Yes, sir, give me a second; I'll have a table right away. [rolls his eyes and walks off]
Randy
Whoa, what'd you say to him?
Gerald
I just... told him who I am.
Randy
Who are you?
Gerald
[whips out his phone and shows Randy the Yelp app] I'm a yelp reviewer. I usually keep it on the down-low so they don't kiss my ass too much.
Greeter
[returns and gets two menus] Right over here, sir. [takes them to their seats]
Waiter
Alright guys, welcome to (vernacular)
Gerald
Thanks, uh, did they mention to you that I am a Yelper?
Waiter
Yes, we've been alerted. Sir.
Gerald
Greeeat. Could you have them turn up the lights a little, please? [the waiter goes away]
Randy
Oh, look at it, Gerald. All the new families moving in. [a new Mexican restaurant - Nueva Familia - is having its grand opening across the street] Our little town is all grown up.
[Nueva Familia, across the street. A family-run restaurant. A boy sweeps up in the kitchen as his mother prepares some tacos on the griddle. His father rushes in.]

Father
Where's that other taco plate? We need it now.
Mother
I'm a little overwhelmed.
Father
I know. But we've put everything into moving here and starting this business, and we have to be impressive. [walks up to the boy and gets down on one knee] David, you must help your mama however you can. We're not going back to that miserable place!
David
I don't wanna go back either.
Mother
Okay, done.
Father
Great! [rises and goes for the plates] We really have to impress this customer. He's a local food critic. [rushes the plates out to the dining area]
Mother
Another one?
The dining area. Cartman is eating away. Before him are three plates. One has two burritos, the second has two tacos and some chips and guacamole, the third has two enchiladas which he hasn't touched yet. Ambient Mexican music plays
Father
[rushes to his table with two plates of food] Okay, here you go, amigo! Another taco plate and the taquitos.
Cartman
Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?
Father
Yes, you mentioned that several times.
Cartman
Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard. [whips out his phone] I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars.
Father
Really?
Cartman
[wiping his mouth clean with his napkin] Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star.
Father
Ohnono. No 1 star, please. What could we do to-?
Cartman
Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts.
Father
Let me get that for you.
Cartman
Great, and can you turn down the music a bit? [taps his left ear a few times] This pagan shit hurts my ears.
Father
Of course! [turns around and hurries away. A spritz is heard, and the camera shows David wiping down a table. Cartman notices]
Cartman
Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor. [snaps his fingers and whistles] Busboy!
David
My name is David. (Dah-veed)
Cartman
Ehexcuse me?
David
I said my name is David. (Dah-veed)
Cartman
Uhh, it's actually pronounced "David," okay?
David
Well, I'm "David." (Dah-veed)
Cartman
It's "David," dude. Look it up.
Father
[comes out with a flan and a sundae on a plate] What's going on? Do not argue, son. We need him. [walks to Cartman's table and sets the desserts down] Here you are, a few free desserts. [the front door opens and some bells are heard] Ho, excuse me. More customers! [goes away]
Male food critic
[enters with his wife] Hi, two of us for lunch, please.
Father
Yes, right away!
Male food critic
Oh, and uh, I just wanted to mention that my wife and I are Yelp reviewers, so uh, your best table, please.
Father
Oh Jeez, you guys too, huh? Ho-kay, uhm, I'll get you set up right over here, okay? [takes them past Cartman, who casts a critical eye]
Cartman
Mmmhmmm! [The father takes them to a booth near Cartman]
Male food critic
Hm, this place seems, nice.
Female food critic
I guess we'll see.
Male food critic
D'I guess we'll see, won't we?
Cartman
Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic.
South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Cartman puts his books in his locker and walks away when Butters catches him
Butters
Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Huh?
Cartman
[wearing a T-shirt that says "WARNING: YELP critic" on the front] Here you go. [takes a bag out of his back pocket and hands it to Butters]
Butters
Whoooaaa. [opens the bag and begins eating what's inside.]
Cartman
Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.
Butters
How do you do it, Eric?
Cartman
I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want.
Butters
Jeeeeezzz. [a second later, Kyle walks by with David]
Kyle
So the cafeteria's back that way, and most of the classrooms are this way, down the-.
Cartman
EEWW. [Kyle and David face him] What's the busboy doing here?
Kyle
David is new to our school.
Cartman
Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school? [mimics a boy on a bicycle] Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?
Kyle
Shut up.
Cartman
Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant two stars, but it could have been worse.
David
Why'd you only give them two stars?
Cartman
I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all.
Kyle
It's not supposed to have water you-!
Cartman
It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David.
David
David. (Dah-veed)
Cartman
David.
David
Dah-víd.
Cartman
David.
David
Dah-víííd.
Cartman
David David David David! I can update this to a one-star review in two seconds, dude. [David turns around and walks away. Kyle turns around, looks at Cartman, and follows David away. A few second later Cartman relaxes] ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic.
The Broflovski house, day, Gerald's den. Gerald is typing away at his computer. To help him focus on his work, he plays some opera music and smokes a pipe
Gerald's review
And yet, there was more. For in this crisp time when autumn begins to fade, the chef brings chicken in habanero, and even adds habanero powder to the crust. But the heat is restrained. You experience the fruity, delicious flavor of this without any spicy pain. I don't need any more pain. Hell, does anyone?
Sheila
[appears at the den doorway with Ike] Gerald! We're going to the park. You wanna come along?
Gerald
Sorry honey, this review for Applebee's has turned into a fifty-pager. And then I have a polish on Ruby Tuesday's.
Sheila
Why don't you take a break from Yelping, Gerald? You seem a little overwhelmed.
Gerald
[leans back on his chair] I am, overwhelmed. Sometimes I don't know what I've gotten myself into. But now everyone relies on my Yelp reviews and I... I don't wanna let anyone down.
Sheila
Well there's chicken in the fridge if you get hungry.
Gerald
Thanks, but I, I've gotta Yelp a new place in CtPaTown tonight. [leans forward a bit] God I'm so damned tired.
Sheila
Okay. Have fun.
Gerald
[to himself]Ha, "fun," she says.
Gerald's review
In finality, I will say that my experience at Applebee's was sublime and my treatment near that of a gladiator most decorated. But the street parking wasn't that great. Two and a half stars.
Gerald
[satisfied with his review Gerald leans back in his chair again commenting to himself] Yes.
The school cafeteria, day. Wendy walks by with a new classmate. Cartman is on his phone while the boys around him go about eating their lunches
Wendy
Come on, Liza, I'll introduce you to the girls.
Butters
Well aren't you eatin' lunch, Eric?
Cartman
Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food.
Tuong Lu Kim
O-okay, Here you are sir! There's orange-peel chicken, some uh shity beef, and uh shitty egg roll!
Kyle
Are you joking?!
Cartman
Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only [emphasis] one star late.
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh no! No one star, prease! You Uelpers are kriwing me! Okay, you no pay! You no pay, prease!
Cartman
Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.
Tuong Lu Kim
Yes yes. I get the fuck out. Thank you! [hurries away]
Butters
Wow! Well you're pretty important, Eric.
Kyle
He's not important. At. All.
Cartman
Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?
Stan
Stop it.
Cartman
What? I just want to hear him say "Sí, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool."
David
Sí, me ride me teeny bicicleta to school.
Cartman
[laughs] That's awesome! [turns around on the bench] I'm gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, David. Thanks. [leaves the table. David leaves his seat]
Kyle
Ah, [facepalm] don't, dude, dude- Don't.
Park County Police Station. Sgt. Yates is at his computer
Barkley
Sir, it's midnight. Go home, get some sleep.
Sgt. Yates
There's no time to sleep when the city's counting on me.
Barkley
More Yelp reviews, sir?
Sgt. Yates
I had a bad experience at Red Lobster and if the people don't know about it, they could too. Folks deserve to know where to eat, Mitch.
Barkley
But does anyone even thank you for it?
Sgt. Yates
I don't need them to. I know they need me, and that's enough.
Barkley
[pats him on the left shoulder] God bless you, sir.
Sgt. Yates
I know. [Barkley walks away]
Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gulch, established in 1986. A table shows the food critic couple who were in Nueva Familia earlier on, now with their son
Whistlin' Willy
Welcome to Whistlin' Willy's. Y'all enjoyin' your pizza?
Male food critic
Look here, my good man, we've been waiting over 15 minutes for you to sing Happy Birthday to our son!
Female food critic
Unfortunately for you, we are both restaurant critics, and so is our son!
Son
[gets an angry face] One star!
Diner 1
Excuse me! Emergency! [Whistlin' Willy rushes over to see what's up] Over here! Emergency! I would like a table. Inside the area with all the little plastic balls please, and make it snappy I am a food critic for Yelp.
Whistlin' Willy
That does it! I've had enough! All you Yelp reviewers get the hell outta here! I don't care what happens to my business! I ain't kissing your asses no more! [moves the male food critic from the table to the double doors on his chair and throws him against the doors] Go on! Every Yelper get the fuck out of here!
Diner 2
Careful now, Bill, you don't want a one-star review.
Whistlin' Willy
You're not a food critic, Dennis! You're a fuckin' mechanic! Now get the fuck out! Go on! All you Yelpin' sons of bitches get the fuck out of here! [Yelpers begin to stream out of the restaurant]
Male food critic
You're gonna regret this, Whistlin' Willy. You can't treat Yelpers this way.
Whistlin' Willy
You get the f- Get the fuck out! [kicks the male food critic in the ass for emphasis as the critic goes out the door.]
Male food critic
AH! [Whistlin' Willy slams the door shut. Gerald shows up a few seconds later]
Gerald
Well, good for you.
Whistlin' Willy
You too, you sonofabitch!
Gerald
Whoa! Hey! [Whistlin' Willy kicks him out too, and Gerald rubs his butt outside]
Shi Tpa Town. Tuong Lu Kim is running around excited about something while David's father sweeps up at Nueva Familia.
Tuong Lu Kim
It's oba! It's oba! [screams some more and approaches Nueva Familia.] You see papaa?! It's oba! [David's father steps outside and Mr. Kim stops him] Whistrin' Wirry! He stand up to the Yelpas! [David's father scans the front page] We don't have to kiss uh their asses anymore! Look! [David's mother comes out to join his father] Everyone is doing the same! [signs go up saying "No Yelpers"] Ha haha. It's ova it's ova! Hey Skeetah, you hear the news?! [He runs off continuing his celebration]
Father
[softly] It's a ...miracle. [jubilantly] IT'S A MIRACLE! [he and his wife hug]
South Park Elementary, day. Cartman walks down the hallway humming to himself
Cartman
Hm hm hm the fuck? [notices a small puddle on the floor] Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor! [notices David at his locker] Hey David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? David. [whistles] Over here, there's some shit on the floor. [David closes his locker and turns away] Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man?
Kyle
[arriving] You haven't heard? Nobody gives a fuck what Yelp reviewers think anymore.
Cartman
What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little "My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool"
David
My name... is David. (Dah-veed)[walks off]
Kyle
HA! [walks off as well]
Cartman
[whips out his phone] Okay, I'm uh I'm updating my review. I'm about to do it. [waits for a comeback but doesn't get one] You'd better say "I ride me bicicleta to school"! [holds up his phone] One star! ... No s-no stars? [no reply. He sighs and tries again] No stars? ... You can't just treat me like I'm nothing... I still know I'm worth something! Come on, guys! [walks away. No one follows him. Seconds later he's back.] Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that's kewl, you guys stay here. [leaves again]
Shi Tpa Town, day. Cartman walks alone by City Wok. He notices a sign there - NO YELPERS. He then walks to Nueva Familia and knocks on the door. David is moving chairs around and stops. Cartman mimics someone riding a bike, and David sticks his middle finger up at him, then turns and walks away. Cartman sighs, turns around, and walks away. He walks right into Butters' house, through the living room, and up into Butters' room. Butters is at his desk drawing a purple car. Cartman sighs
Butters
[noticing] Oh, hey Eric.
Cartman
[hops onto Butters' bed and lays down] It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke.
Butters
Oh I'm sorry, bud.
Cartman
All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day.
Butters
Well Eric, you should be proud that people wanna be like you. Ha ah, I mean, you really started something.
Cartman
I guess.
Butters
Well if these people look up to you, maybe, maybe you can sort of, set the record straight and show them the way it's supposed to be done.
Cartman
[sits up] You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again.
Sgt. Yates' house. Yates serves himself some whisky on the rocks while doing more reviews. His wife Maggie walks up to him.
Maggie
Harrison Yates, what's gotten into you?
Yates
That's it, Maggie. I'm hanging it up. If people are gonna be trying all the new restaurants in town they'll... have to do it without my reviews.
Maggie
What are ya talkin' about? You said that protectin' people from bad dinin' experiences was what kept you goin'.
Yates
The restaurants put up signs sayin' I can't come in. I don't know why they singled me out, but it's like, people don't need me. [opens a letter and reads it] Well I'll be damned.
Maggie
What is it?
Yates
Somebody's put a note in the mailbox... asking me to come and talk to them. They do need me. [rises and goes to the coat rack] I need to get goin'.
Maggie
You want me to come along?
Yates
No, they're just asking for me. I guess... [opens the front door] maybe I do have a town to protect. [smiles and leaves]
Cartman's house, Sunday. Cartman is getting refreshments ready for his guests in the living room. Liane walks up to him
Liane
Oh, are you having a party sweetheart?
Cartman
Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting.
Liane
Oh, how fun!
Cartman
It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom! [she goes away as he walks to the front door. He opens the door and sees a sea of reviewers]
Yelpers
Hello, hi. My name is [they all give their names at the same time] and I'm here for the meeting. [Cartman freezes up]
A reviewer
Is this the right place?
Cartman
Fuuuuuuck! [closes the door and keeps it closed with his back] Mom!
Liane
I'm going, honey.
Cartman
But Mom, there's like a billion people here.
Liane
Oh yes, sweetie, I think quite a few people are Yelp reviewers.
Cartman
Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?!
Liane
I guess so, honey. Do you need more lemonade?
Cartman
Mom, there's a fucking billion people here! [yes, Yelpers all up and down the block, filling the streets all around. Moments later, he appears at his bedroom window on the second floor, and holds court] Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized-
A Yelper
COULD YOU SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER?
Cartman
Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.
Other Yelpers
That's right! Yeah!
Cartman
Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic. [Sgt. Yates puffs up his chest, pretty sure that it's him] It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is.
Other Yelpers
That's right. Yeah!
Gerald
[confidently humble] Huh. Oh thanks.
Cartman
Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following [holds up index finger] one captain, we can fight to get our power back!
A Yelper
Poweerrrrr Back!
Cartman
So now rise up, and [pounds on the window sill] fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!
Other Yelpers
Yeah! Let's go! [more cheering from the Yelpers]
Sgt. Yates
Alright, follow me!
Gerald
This way, everyone! [the crowd turns left and moves off]
Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gulch, day. A mother and son leave, but are still nearby when the crowd of Yelpers arrives and begins destroying the gulch. They then leave quickly. After a barrel is thrown through a window, Willy looks up to see what's going on
News 4 segment
Anchor Tom
Another local business is closing its doors tonight after being taken down by Yelp reviewers. Whistlin' Willy's, a child favorite in town, was destroyed and its owner stripped and beheaded. The following video is graphic. [a crowd of Yelp reviewers is shown and they are ululating. Two Yelpers bring Whistlin' Willy in front of the camera and hold him there. The crowd continues to ululate]
Whistlin' Willy
No, please! No! Nonono! [the Yelpers pull the mask off his head and show it off to the camera] Awwww. [the ululating continues]
South Park Elementary, day. "Bad to the Bone" plays as the school bell rings. Cartman walks down the hallway as a Big Critic on Campus, while in voice over he is singing the words. The other kids either hold their hands up or hold themselves a little tighter as Cartman walks to the tune of "Bad To The Bone." He's met by a group of boys led by Kyle.
Kyle
We all... loved... Whistlin' Willy's!
Cartman
[just shrugs] It didn't do well with Yelpers.
Token
You assholes destroyed the best place in town because they wouldn't kiss your asses!
Cartman
Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked.
Kyle
Nobody went for the fucking food!
Cartman
Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school?
David
Si. Me ride me teeny bicicleta to school. [turns around and walks away. Kyle flashes an angry look at Cartman, then watches David leave]
Kyle
[gets in Cartman's face] You're done! [turns around and walks away with the remaining boys]
Cartman
Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word! [softly] And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs.
The Broflovski house, day, Gerald's den. Gerald is typing away at his computer, with music and pipe, as before.
Gerald's review
I found the wait staff at Red Lobster to be rude, and barely even acknowledging who I was. Or what I meant to this city.
Sheila
[appears at the doorway with Ike] Gerald, I'm taking Ike to clown school. You care to joing us?
Gerald
I can't, honey. I'm now the leader of thousands of people. They all hang on my every word. And I'm going to use my power to finally get what this town really needs. [Sheila and Ike just walk away]
Shi Tpa Town. The peace and quiet of the morning is disrupted by semiautomatic gunfire. Yelpers run into the area, and a bomb goes off behind Dee's Meats. Another News 4 segment
Reporter
For the fifth day in a row, historic Shi Tpa Town is under siege by Yelp reviewers. The restaurants are still refusing to be intimidated. and the Yelp reviewers are- [quickly ducks as the gunfire hits very close to him] -and the Yelp reviewers are preparing for all-out war. [real war footage is shown] The angry Yelp reviewers are demanding special treatment at all city restaurants. They claim that as local food critics they deserve respect and that all who oppose them will suffer. The online restaurant critics are getting ready to bring businesses to their knees, and some are already closing their doors. [Nueva Familia is shown...]
Reporter
One local restaurant worker actually called out the Yelp critics' leader.
David
I guess you win, huh, big shot?! If you really are any kind of important to anybody, then get your bullshit food critic ass to the south of town and face me! Because you aren't a food critic, and you aren't important! [Sgt. Yates looks at the screen in the police station] And unless you're a chicken, I'll see you south of town! [Yates walks into his office and gets his coat]
Barkley
Where are you going, sir?
Sgt. Yates
You heard him. Little Mexican kid called me out. [shows his gun, then places it back in its holster] If he wants to fight me, that's fine.
Barkley
You need backup sir?
Sgt. Yates
No, he's just calling me out. [turns and walks out]
Barkley
God bless you sir.
Sgt. Yates
I know!
The south of town, a big meadow or park on the outskirts of town. David marches towards the meeting point. Kyle runs up to catch him
Kyle
David! Dude, wait! [Kyle is next to him now] Dude, you don't wanna do this. You don't know what Cartman's capable of.
David
Where I come from, we settle things with our fists!
Kyle
But this isn't Mexico.
David
I'm not from Mexico, dude! I'm from Idaho! [Kyle glances away, embarrassed] I'm gonna show this prick how we do things in Boise!
Cartman
Oh, hello David! [Cartman is flanked by hundreds of Helpers]
Kyle
Alright, you've got your army! You've got your followers! If you're such a great leader, then just tell the city what you want, fat-ass!
Gerald
Don't call me fat, son! I'm doing this because they've-
Sgt. Yates
What I want is to be able to lead these fine people with the respect and the dignity-
Yelper 1
I didn't ask to be the leader, I was appointed! You see, I'm extremely important to this town, and I'm not going to be-
Yelper 2
My journey is this town's food- [soon everyone is talking over each other, and David and Kyle just look at each other.]
Yelper 3
You've made these people feel unwanted, and now they look to me for answers.
Gerald
Now here I stand, vulnerable, afraid, and yet willing to do what the people of this-
Male food critic
And so we said "to hell with it!" And we took the challenge to go from the town's food critics to the town's spiritual leaders! What do we want?
Yelper 4
[another woman] People would say "Oh, you're just a food blogger. You're just a tiny voice in the crowd. Well now my voice is heard, and I will-" [her voice melts into the other voices]
Cartman
...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! Right, guys? Maybe I don't deserve special treatment, but how else can I be the elite food critic they want? [more chatter]
Kyle
[after a few moments] Every person here thinks this is about them.
David
I think I know what to do.
Kyle
Yeah. Me too.
They Mayor's office, day. Mayor McDaniels sits at her desk, with several townsfolk standing behind her. Kyle stands to the right of the desk in a suit. Fanfare plays
Mayor McDaniels
And for all your service to this community, we want to once and for all declare you our most elite food critic. To distinguish you, we present to you... the Golden Badge. [an aide pins the badge on Gerald's coat] Wearing this badge means you will always get the special treatment that you deserve. [Johnson rings a bell and Fr. Maxi hums a short chant]
Gerald
Thank you, Mayor. It's a big responsibility, but I suppose I have to accept. I will do my best to serve this town.
Mayor McDaniels
We know you will. [shows him the exit. He turns right and walks out. Another aide closes the exit door]
Kyle
Okay, bring in the next one.
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Davis, you have proven yourself a leader. And for all your service to this community, we want to once and for all declare you our most elite food critic. To distinguish you, we present the Golden Badge. [an aide pins the badge on Mr. Davis's coat]
Mr. Davis
[softly] Wwooww.
Mayor McDaniels
Wearing this badge means you will always get the special treatment you deserve. [Johnson rings the bell and Fr. Maxi hums the short chant]
Nueva Familia, day. The signs that showed the restaurant was shutting down are gone; the Grand Opening sign remains
David
Alright, we got all the restaurants to agree to let the Yelpers in and make them feel special.
Father
How did you do it, son?
(vernacular), dinnertime. An elite food critic is about to order.
Diner 3
Hi, yes, the steak, please. [points to his golden badge] I'm the uh Yelp elite. [the waiter takes his order to the kitchen and...]
Waiter
Alright, we got a Yelper. Give it that special attention.
Chef
Youuu got it! [puts his finger into his nose and pulls out some boogers, and smears them on the steak.]
Montage. What follows is a series of scenes showing cooks and waiters doing nasty things to Yelpers' dishes, including more boogers on them, masturbating to them, peeing on them, farting on them, etc... Some examples; Mr. Kim masturbating onto a plate of broccoli chicken, then serving it to the food critic couple, and grinning to himself; a Steed chef masturbates onto a plate of thin steaks and gives it to a waiter, who serves it to Sgt. Yates; Gerald finishes a review, then eats crab legs at a fine restaurant. Back at (vernacular), a waiter farts on a salad and gives it to the female food critic. Later, the couple critiques the restaurant's décor to the greeter. Whistlin' Willy serves up three pizzas to three different elite Yelpers. Sgt. Yates is back at the office writing another review.
Lead Singer

End of You're Not Yelping

Safe Space
South Park Elementary, day. Cartman sits in PC Prinicpal's office hyperventilating, teary-eyed. PC Principal and Mr. Mackey both look at him.
PC Principal
So these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed?
Cartman
[voice shaking terribly] Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat.
PC Principal
Alright, why don't you take me back to what happened?
Cartman
I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by [Craig and Clyde appear around the corner] Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I asked one of the kids [Clyde] if he would take a picture of me [holding two dumbbells, one in each hand] and he did. And I looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in "Don't I look ripped?" and I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn't ripped, and they said that I was fat and I didn't have muscles. The Internet made fun of me and [is overcome with emotion and hyperventilates. PC Principal sniffs and clears his throat.]
Mr. Mackey
Well, Eric, maybe you shouldn't have put a picture of you in your underwear up on social media.
PC Principal
[jumps up and faces Mr. Mackey] Hey! You got a fuckin' problem Mackey!
Mr. Mackey
N-No, PC Principal.
PC Principal
Because body-shaming is fuckin' serious, and I'm not gonna allow that shit in my school! [faces Cartman] Nobody should have to feel that kind of shame!
Whole Foods Market, day. Liane walks out with her groceries, Randy walks around inside marveling at all the stuff. Next, he's in Checkout 5 having his purchases scanned.
Cashier
Okay. sir, looks like your total is $37.83.
Randy
[pulls out his wallet and takes out $40] Alright.
Cashier
[checks the monitor] Okay, and, would you like to add a dollar donation to help hungry kids around the world?
Randy
[real quiet] Oh uh, no, that, that's okay.
Cashier
Sorry?
Randy
[real quiet] I'm, I'm good.
Cashier
[having trouble hearing him clearly] I'm sorry, you don't want to give the dollar to hungry kids?
Randy
[real quiet] Not today, thank you.
Cashier
Okay, no problem. [punches in the last few numbers into the register.] A window's gonna come up and ask if you're helping the hungry kids, just hit "No, I'm not."
Randy
[real quiet] Oh, come on.
Cashier
Try hitting it again. It's the box below the one that says, "Sure, I'd love to help however I can." [Randy hits the button again... and again a few more times, but it only beeps twice. The cashier looks at it.] Ah, darn thing. Sorry. Most people give the dollar. I can do this manually. [turns to the register and taps a few keys]
Randy
Look, I give money to charity a lot, okay?
Cashier
Oh, sure you do.
Randy
I do. I just don't want to every time I shop for food.
Cashier
That's completely understandable. [reads something] "Have customer speak on the-" Oh-okay. if you can just speak into the voice decoder and say "I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids."
Randy
[leans in and speaks into the "decoder"] I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids. [his voice echoes throughout the store, and everyone takes notice]
Cashier
Okay, that's got it. So with the ice cream, the vodka, pizza pockets, and nothing for hungry kids, that's $37.83. [getting a bit sarcastic] Oh, don't forget your change.
Randy
Look, if I give money every time I went grocery-shopping, I would be-!
Cashier
[cuts him off] Thanks for shopping, sir. Next, please.
Randy
[takes his paper bag full of groceries and leaves] Dick!
PC Principal's office, moments. PC Principal opens the door and Kyle walks in.
PC Principal
Morning, Kyle. Have a seat right there. [Kyle takes the seat next to Cartman and is instantly displeased] You probably heard that Eric here has been dealing with some body shaming? [Cartman is still whimpering]
Kyle
Uh huh.
PC Principal
Well Eric and I have been talking, and we've decided it's probably best for him to get off of social media.
Kyle
Yeah probably.
PC Principal
So what we're looking for is a student volunteer. Somebody who can put the things Eric wants up on the Internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more of a safe space for him.
Kyle
Wait, what?
Cartman
I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time [gathers his thoughts] so you'd probably do a really good job.
Kyle
You want me to run Cartman's Twitter and Yelp account and only give him the good comments?
PC Principal
That's right.
Kyle
No.
PC Principal
Kyle, you know what body-shaming is, right? How much it can hurt someone's life? All you have to do is check out all the comments, type out just the positive ones, and give that to Eric on paper.
Kyle
If he doesn't like what people say on Twitter, he can get off. [Cartman begins to cry]
PC Principal
Okay Kyle, well maybe you'd like two weeks' detention instead.
Kyle
[a bit stunned, considers his options] Give me... give me detention.
PC Principal
You sure about that?
Kyle
Yeah, I'll take the detention.
PC Principal
That's two weeks' detention for you, bud! I'll see you at 4! [Kyle looks at Eric, gets up, and leaves. Next, PC Principal is talking to another student] And when we said someone should probably help Eric by filtering out any negative comments, he mentioned you by name.
Wendy
Is this a joke?
Cartman
I'm not a joke!
PC Principal
Nothing funny about this, Testaburger! This is a big problem in our country!
Wendy
I'm not doing it.
PC Principal
And that's two weeks' detention for you! Congratulations! [Wendy looks at Eric, gets up, and leaves. Next, PC Principal is talking to another student] So, any comments that seem inappropriate or hurtful in any way, you need to delete and not include in your daily report to Eric. [Butters is shown next to Cartman now]
Cartman
I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
Butters
Do I gotta?
PC Principal
You want detention?
Butters
Well if I get detention, uh I'll get grounded.
PC Principal
Then you start today! Butters, it's your job to make sure Eric has a safe space.
Whole Foods Market, day. Randy is at a salad bar creating his own salad. A female shopper is making one too, and their tongs clash over greens
Female Shopper
Oh ahhh, I'm sorry.
Randy
Oh no, my, my fault.
Female Shopper
Isn't it great having a Whole Foods?
Randy
This is where I come for lunch every day. Gotta eat healthy to stay fit. [pleased at this encounter. He turns to leave and sees the cashier from before, who waves back at him. To himself] Aw, shit, it's that guy. [as no one else is waiting, he goes ahead and makes his purchases]
Cashier
Aand how are you today, sir?
Randy
Great. [leans in and in a low voice] Uh, listen, before you ring me up, I just wanna let you know I'm not gonna be giving extra money to charity, so can we, can we just skip that part?
Cashier
Oh no problem sir, they've updated the system so it's a lot more streamlined now. Find everything you need today?
Randy
Yeah, thanks.
Cashier
There we go, and that's... Okay, and would you like to give a dollar to hungry kids today?
Randy
[softly] No. I said no, before.
Cashier
Oh that's right. Okay, there's a picture of a little hungry boy. Will you just press on his belly? [Randy does so, and hears "Oww, owww." The cashier checks the readout] Okay, that's got it. So, with the no help for hungry kids that's $18.87. [Randy hands him a $20 bill] Out of 20. [the cashier gives him some change back in the coin return tray] Your change is right there, just pull the sandwich out of the little girl's mouth. [a cardboard cutout of a little girl hides the coin return]
Randy
This is not streamlined!
Cashier
It's just the new change dispenser, sir. [Randy then goes ahead and tries to pull the sandwich away]
Randy
[a couple of grunts later] I can't.
Cashier
Yes, she's a hungry one. You've gotta pull hard.
Randy
Dammit! The sandwich isn't coming out.
Cashier
Try putting your foot on her face. [Randy promptly does this. He also notices the woman he bumped into earlier in Checkout 4 and flashes a smile to her. Finally he pulls the sandwich out of the cutout's mouth and gets his change and his groceries] Have a nice day, sir!
Randy
I was having a nice day! [leaves the store]
South Park Elementary hallway, day. Cartman puts his books into his locker and closes it. As he walks away, Butters appears around the corner and catches up to him.
Butters
[sounding quite tired] Eric, hold up.
Cartman
There you are. You have my social media comments?
Butters
Yeah. Yeah, right here. [hands him the papers] I just finished this morning.
Cartman
[reviews them] Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments?
Butters
Yeah. And the people commenting on your Yelp page starts here. [points to the first comment on the current page]
Cartman
Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great! [turns around and walks by Kyle, who's at his locker.] Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now.
Butters
It's a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness.
South Park Elementary gym, later. The whole school is in attendance as PC Principal introduces someone.
PC Principal
Alright everyone, listen up. In order to better understand the negative effects of body-shaming, we have a- [points to someone on the bleachers] HEY LESLIE! PUT A FUCKIN' SOCK IN IT! [Leslie was whispering to Esther again, and again she backs off slowly] We have a guest speaker today who will challenge our perceptions of physical beauty. [steps towards a screen upon which is a graphic that says "NO MORE FAT SHAMING"] So please welcome action star and hero, Steven Seagal. [claps a few times, then puts the mic into a mic stand and steps aside as music plays. Pics of Seagal pop up as a slide show]
Steven Seagal
[voice-over] You've got a problem with me? I'm your worse nightmare. I have no fear of death, more important, I don't fear life. [gun shot sound effect. The slide show ends and an obese Seagal walks into the gym with a gun drawn. He gets to the mic and begins to whimper, and lowers the gun] I'm a big action movie star and people are pretty stoked on me. And then I put a picture of myself up on the Internet and I had my shirt off and I said "Do you think I'm ripped?" and some people commented saying I didn't look ripped, that I was fat, and they called me Steven Se-boom-boom, so I put another picture on the Internet and I thought people would be stoked on me, but they said that I looked like a fat turd, and they said I wasn't buff. [hyperventilates] Body-shaming isn't cool, and, if p-people shame you on the Inter n-net, you have to make sure that you stay, you stay strong and tell everyone you're proud of how you look, like this. [begins to dance as "Got To Be Real" starts playing]
The school hallway, later. Steven is headed out and PC Principal catches up to him.
PC Principal
Hey, Seagal! Listen, that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids.
Steven Seagal
[sniffs] Thank you.
PC Principal
I can see that you're in a lot of pain, bro. I've got someone who I think can help. [at the office a few minutes later, with Seagal and Butters. He talks to Butters] So I want you to do for Mr. Seagal the same thing that you're doing for Eric Cartman.
Butters
But PC Principal, I really don't have time.
PC Principal
This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness! I think you can give him a little of your time!
Butters
Yes sir...
Whole Foods Market, later. Randy is back to buy more groceries. He's back at Checkout 5 with the same cashier as before
Cashier
Find everything you needed today?
Randy
Yes.
Cashier
Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98. Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?
Randy
Yes, I would like to give a dollar.
Cashier
[suprised] You want to give a dollar?
Randy
Yes, I will.
Cashier
[excited sounding] Oh wow, okay! So that's $10 for the beer, $4.20 in chocolate-covered peanuts, $26 in filet mignons, [sarcastically] and one dollar for hungry kids around the world. On "amount of donation" it will say $10, $20, or $50, can you just press the "$1" box? [Randy does so and bells, sirens, and colored lights go off. The cashier gets on the mic and says] Attention shoppers, somebody just joined the $1 club, giving one whole dollar to help feed hungry children. [quickly goes around the checkout] Here's your T-shirt! [quickly slips it on Randy and takes a picture, then prints the picture. The shirt says "I Gave $1.00 to End Hunger." The cashier pins the picture on the "$1" cork board, which was empty before] Ho, won't the kids be thrilled when they get their piece of that big impressive dollar. [walks back to his register and sings] For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a holly good fellow, for he's a holly good fellow! He ended world hunger. [Randy takes his groceries and leaves, whimpering]
Butter's house, afternoon, bedroom. Butters is toiling away at his computer.
Butters
Yech. Oh God that's terrible. Jesus.
Demi Lovato
[sitting on Butters' bed] Yeah. No, I'm telling you, Tracy, it's the greatest thing ever. I'm getting all my Twitter and Instagram comments on paper, and the nasty mean stuff, all gets edited out.
Butters
Whoa my God. Wugh.
Demi Lovato
Yeah. And the coolest thing? Ever since I started using this service, all of my followers are actually way more stoked on me. So cool, right?
Cartman
Butters!
Butters
[startled] Yeah!
Cartman
[at the bedroom door] What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says "This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!"
Butters
Well I'm sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I'm overloaded with all the new people.
Cartman
What new people? [walks up to the computer]
Butters
Well I've got Demi Lovato [points to her] to take care of now, and Lena Dunham just put a picture of her asshole on Twitter, and wants only the positive comments.
Cartman
Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!
Demi Lovato
[stands up] Am so! But I don't care. People just have to accept my body the way it is.
Cartman
Butters, I want this fixed by tonight, you got that!
Butters
Okay, Eric. [Cartman walks away]
A commercial. "Amazing Grace" plays with a female voice. A poor community is shown. Randy walks among the poor folk
Randy
This is a place where hope is scarce. These people are hungry. Little Jojo here might not eat today. But does that mean it's okay for cashiers to ask us for money while we're in the checkout line? It isn't right, and it isn't fair. Just $2 a day adds up to 62 goddamned dollars a month if you go to Whole Foods as much as I do. Nobody should have to feel the shame, the humiliation, of being asked to add money onto their grocery bill. Help now. Let's make grocery stores a #SAFESPACE for all. Together, we can make a difference.
Girl
Because charity-shaming hurts everyone. [Randy holds her a bit closer]
PC Principal's office, day. He and Mr. Mackey are talking to someone
PC Principal
You know, if there's one thing I really respect, it's plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful. These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie, and we wanna make sure they're protected from any harassing comments.
Butters
[Butters is seated across from PC Principal with an entire row of plus-sized women in lingerie] Do I have to, sir?
PC Principal
Hey, they're gonna putting themselves out there, and all I'm asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean.
Butters
PC Principal, ah I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through.
PC Principal
I know it's a lot, but I just really need you to help these plus-sized models. And Vin Diesel.
Butters
Vin Diesel too??
PC Principal
Look bro! You've done an amazing job with Eric Cartman. You have really turned his life around, and other people deserve... to be as happy as he is.
South Park Elementary hallway. A song comes up, and Cartman sings first. Soon, an abstract space appears in which are tiny rooms - a safe space - one for each person singing
Cartman
Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe spaaaace.

Seagal
My safe spaaaace.

Cartman
[eating in a restaurant, Butters hands him more comments] People don't judge me and haters don't hate in my safe spaaaace. [Butters is hard at work]

PC Principal
Your safe spaaaace.

Cartman and Seagal
Bully-proof windows, troll-safe doors, nothing but kindness and healing.

Randy
You might call me a pussy, but I won't hear you in my safe spaaaace.

Seagal
My safe spaaaace.

Cartman
Bully-proof windows.

Demi Lovato
If you do not like me, you are not allowed in my safe spaaaace.

Plus-sized models
My safe spaaaace

PC Principal
[to Vin Diesel] Look and you will see there's a very select crowd in your safe spaaaace. [Steven Seagal is resting on a bed in his safe space]

All
My safe spaaaace.

Cartman
People that support me.

All
Mixed in with

Cartman
More people that support me.

All
And say nice things. Rainbows all around me, there is no shame in my safe spaaaace.

Randy
My safe spaaaace.

Cartman
Bully-proof windows. [a change in tempo and a masked villain enters the video.]

Reality
I am going to tear down your safe space! Brick by brick, I shall smash it with glee!

Cartman
What? Who is that?

Reality
You cannot stop me from getting inside! I am cold and I am hard, and my name... is Reality.

Demi Lovato
Oh no, not reality! Somebody stop him!

Cartman
I'll take care of him, Demi! [shoots lightning from his hands, and the various people in their safe spaces are now dressed to dance!]}}

{{ScriptDialog|All|
You can't ruin our lives, Reality!

Cartman
Our safe spaces will keep you out!

Reality
Drat!

All
We can face almost anything!

Cartman
But Reality we can do without!

Reality
Nooooo... [vanishes]

Cartman
Bully-proof windows.

All
Troll-safe doors. [slowing down] My Safe Spaaaaaaaace! [all stop]

Cartman
That was nice.
Whole Foods Market, day. The cashier at Checkout 5 sends one shopper off
Cashier
All right, thanks, have a great day. [Randy steps up] Good afternoon sir.
Randy
[self-assured] Oh, hello. You might know Steven Seagal [who steps up, with his gun aimed at the cashier]
Steven Seagal
You wanna play with me?
Randy
And this is Vin Diesel.
Cashier
Oh, hello gentlemen.
Randy
It'd be... a really bad idea for you to charity-shame me today. These guys are here to protect my safe space.
Cashier
That's great. [hums to himself] This little piggy went to market. This little piggy stayed home. This little piggy was in Fast And The Furious, [Vin Diesel begins to whimper and walks away] and this little piggy goes direct to cable. [Steven Seagal begins to whimper and walks away. The cashier jabs Randy in the belly] And this little piggy just bought fifty-three dollars in beer and frozen pizzas. Would you like to make a dollar donation to hungry kids today?
A second commercial. We're back in the poor community. "Amazing Grace" plays with a deep male voice, and Demi Lovato walks in
Demi Lovato
Look around you. What do you see? People who are slim. Skinny. But not everyone can have nice bodies like them. Just imagine it. Putting your pictures up on Twitter just to have some people write comments about your weight. It happens, all too often.
Randy
[taking over] But it doesn't stop there. People also can be shamed for other traits viewed as negative. Mike here was shamed for not being a good recycler.
Demi Lovato
And so together, we have created #shamelessAmerica, [a screen pops up with "let's work towards a #shamelessAmerica."] so no one is ever labeled...
Fat Woman
Tubby.
Man with Cap
Bad with tools.
Woman 2
Dyke!
Man 2
Butter butter dirty line cutter.
Randy
Let's work together to create a completely shameless America.
Boy
[emaciated] Because shaming hurts everyone. [Randy holds him a bit closer]
Butters' room, night. He's editing out negative comments on Demi Lovato's social media pages before printing them
Butters
[reading through online messages] "Hey Demi Lovato, I bet your vagina has a-" [begins to gag] oh. Oh God. Oh, that's horrible [picks up a waste basket and vomits into it] Augh. [coughs] Jeez. Delete. Delete that too. [continues reading comments aloud] "I'd like to stick my wiener into those fat rolls of-" Oh God! [Reality sneaks into his room] Uh, delete! "You aren't fat, but my dick is-" Whoa, God.
Reality
HaHAA!
Butters
GAAAHHH!
Reality
So you're the one trying to destroy me, eh??
Butters
What? [falls out of his chair. Reality tries to grab him, but misses. Butters runs to a night stand]
Reality
You little shit! Keep me out, will you?
Butters
I don't know you, sir!
Reality
You can't stop me! [tries to grab Butters again, but breaks the lamp on the night stand] I'm going to kill you! [jumps up to fall on him. At that moment, the bedroom door opens]
Stephen
Butters! What are you doing!
Butters
[panicked] Well-ll the man! Uh, the man is gonna get me! [Butters points to where Reality was standing only for the shot to widen showing he is no longer there]
Whole Foods Market, day. The cashier is ringing Randy up.
Cashier
And some chocolate-covered almonds. Vanderpump Sangria mix.
Randy
Yeah, um, I'm a little tired because I'm actually hosting a huge fundraiser for my charity organization [shows off his shirt: "#ShamelessAmerica"] that I'm sort of the head of.
Cashier
That's great, sir. Ice cream sandwiches.
Randy
Yeah, we're gonna raise a lot of money. Celebrities are coming. Demi Lovato is givin' a hundred thousand for the event.
Cashier
Wonderful. Rotisserie chicken. Oh yep, gotta have that Frank's hot sauce.
Randy
I just thought, you know, a fundraiser dinner was sort of the appropriate place to ask for donations.
Cashier
That's great, sir. Okay, your total is $37.85, and would you like to give a dollar to help put a hamster through college?
Randy
[stunned] ...What? Did you not hear anything I said? I'm - I'm doin' all this stuff.
Cashier
Not a problem, sir. [takes out a hamster from behind the counter] If you could just press the N0 button and tell the little hamster he's not going to college. Just look him right in the eye, sir, and say "Not today, buddy."
Randy
Actually, my big fundraising gala is helping put hamsters through college too.
Cashier
[Excited] Oh, really? Wow. Did you hear that, Banjo? You've got support. [puts the hamster back behind the counter] Well, you have a nice day sir. [hands Randy his receipt] And thank so much for being so generous.
Randy
You're welcome. [takes his groceries, but has no bag to put them in. He doesn't mind]
South Park Elementary hallway. Stan, Kyle, Davíd and Kenny walk along when Cartman interrupts them.
Cartman
Hey Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it.
Kyle
There's more than two people on the Internet.
Butters
The man! The man the man the man the man! [runs around the corner completely naked] The man he's gonna get me! He shadows me everywhere! [stops another student and gets in his face] Do you see the man?!
Kyle
[turns him around] Butters, what are you doing?! [the other student leaves]
Butters
Well he's gonna get me!
Kyle
Dude, Butters, you're seeing things! Sifting through all the horrible stuff people say on the Internet is making you lose it!
Butters
[breaks free and runs off] The world is darkness! The man is coming!
Stan
Dude, Butters! [he and Kyle give chase. Butters goes up a flight of stairs]
Butters
Aaaaa! Aaaaa!
Kindergarten, day. The teacher quizzes the kids on a story
Teacher
And what color is the little ball the kittens are playing with?
Butters
[runs into the classroom] Run for your lives, you little fuckers, the man is coming! [the kids scream as Kyle enters the room. Stan, Davíd and Kenny follow him in]
Kyle
Butters, listen to my voice.
Butters
The man is gonna get me if I don't stop!
Kyle
Then stop, dude! Butters, all this isn't worth it. Just. Take, the detention, dude.
Butters
[thinks a moment and jumps through a glass window on the second floor] YEEAAAAAGGHH! [hits the snow hard]
South Park Community Center, Night, Shameless America Charity Event. Guests arrive in limousines. Gerald steps out of one and goes inside. Randy is hosting. Fanfare plays
Randy
Alright everyone, thanks for coming to help raise money to stop shaming, and put hamsters through college.
Guest
What'd he say?
Randy
And now, a woman who knows about shaming firsthand, supermodel Gigi Hadid.
Gigi
Alright, everyone enjoying themselves? How's that filet mignon? [approving comments all around] You know, we're all here for a really important reason. Because everyone should-
Stephen
Randy, Randy, we've got a problem.
Randy
What?
Stephen
Reality's here. He's trying to crash the party.
Randy
Reality? Who let him in? Shit! [leaves to face him]
Reality
[making a nuisance of himself at a table, spills a glass of wine] Woo, nice wine, huh? What do you think of that? [tips another glass over] You know what I think of your pretty flowers? [grabs the centerpiece bouquet and throws it to the ground, then dumps a guest's dinner on his lap] There you go. How do you like that? [Randy and Stephen arrive]
Randy
Alright buddy, let's go.
Reality
I shit on all of you!
Randy
Seagal?! [Steven Seagal approaches with gun drawn and aimed at Reality]
Reality
[to Seagal, Randy, and three guests] Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! [jumps over the table and rushes the stage, then grabs the mic from Gigi Hadid] Give me that, you stupid bitch! [she walks off] What a lovely charity event. I suppose you're all feeling pretty good about yourselves, hm? What have you done? You've raised $300 by spending half a million on filet mignon and crystal glasses. [crowd is silenced and ashamed at themselves] Look at you, Vin Dipshit. You think fat-shaming is wrong, so in response you show off your abs. You're the one fat-shaming, idiot! What's the matter with you people?! You're saaad that people are meeean? Well I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal arts college campus! We eat too much; we take our spoiled lives for granted, feel a little bad about it sometimes! No, you wanna put up all your shit on the Internet and have every single person say "Hooray for you!" Fuck you. You're all pricks. And I've got news for you! While you've all been sitting here trying to feel good, the little boy who sucked all your shit is about to die from it!
Seagal
What?
Hell's Pass hospital, later. Butters is in a recovery room with tubes going into him and wires attached to him. Steven Seagal and Vin Diesel are there with the plus-sized models, Demi Lovato, Gigi Hadid, PC Principal, Stephen Stotch, and others
Demi Lovato
Oh my God. What have we done?
Seagal
Jesus, I d-I didn't even think.
PC Principal
I guess... I asked too much of one kid.
Randy
Listen, everybody. [the group splits in two so the camera can see him] I think there's a way to try and make this right for everyone.
A third commercial. We're back in the poor community. "Amazing Grace" plays with an organ, and a choir joins in later
Randy
To date, Shameless America has raised over $40,000. With that money, we are putting more and more iPads into these people's hands. [all the kids look at the iPads, not sure what to do with them] With iPads, these people can finally help more Americans get rid of negativity on their social media. [Jojo returns with an iPad, handing it to Randy] Oh, thanks Jojo. I'm shame-free now, and you can be too. For just $1 a day, one of these beautiful children will protect you from trolls and make your Internet a safe space. [a screen pops up with "We won't rest until America is #completelyshameless"]We won't rest until America is completely shameless. The world can be brutal, but Shameless America is going to continue to take steps to make sure everyone has a safe space... forever.
South Park Town Square, day. The stage is set for a hanging. Reality has a noose around his neck, and Butters is set to be the executioner. Butters is out of the hospital with a head brace and a crutch
Butters
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Randy
Uh huh. [Butters pulls the lever and the trap door opens underneath Reality, making him drop and hang. After some choking, Reality dies and the crowd erupts in cheers]
End of Safe Space

Tweek x Craig
South Park Elementary Gym, day. PC Principal is once again addressing the students in the gym.
PC Principal
Alright everyone, listen up. [Wendy reads through some cue cards at the podium] Today we're going to be showing you some art from our Asian-American students-DAMMIT LESLIE, SHUT YOUR FUCKING PIE-HOLE! [Leslie is shown, but she's confused, as she's not talking to anyone.] from our Asian-American students presented by our student-body president, Wendy Testaburger.
Wendy
Hey guys. As you know, we have several new students here at South Park Elementary. We have been getting to know some of the Asian girls who have introduced us to an art style called "yaoi." [A picture on a slideshow showing the English and Japanese spellings of the word, and Oriental music plays.] Yaoi is a blend of emotion and beauty involving two people whose love is looked down upon. The art tries to show that all love is magical, like in Lisa Akimoto's piece, "Tweek and Craig - Forbidden Love." [Tweek and Craig in a French kiss.]
Girls
Awwww.
Tweek
What?
Wendy
Kelly Zhou goes a bit more whimsical with "Craig and Tweek: Moonlight Dance." [Tweek wears a pink bow in his hair and is wrapped in a pink ribbon while Craig stands behind him looking down at his face.]
Girls
Awwww.
Craig
Dude, what the fuck?
Wendy
In yaoi art, the seme, or top, is usually dominating the uke, or bottom, as demonstrated in Heather Nishimura's "Boizu Rabu." [Craig reaching down into Tweek's briefs as Tweek reaches up to stroke Craig's head]
Girls
Awwww. [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
Wendy
But yaoi can branch out to other things as well.
Cartman
Uh oh.
Wendy
As we see here in "Lily, Frog, Tweek and Craig." [Tweek is on his back with Craig on top of him pinning him down while looking into his eyes.]
The hallway, after the assembly. Shown are David, Token, Stan, Butters, still in his head brace, Kyle, Kenny, and Jimmy.
Stan
I just don't get it. I mean, Tweek and Craig aren't gay. Right?
Kyle
[questioning, seeking confirmation] No. We would know.
Butters
Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that?
Jimmy
Yeah, what is this yaoi thing all about? I am so c-c-c-confused.
Stan
And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig... could it happen to any of us?
The school lobby. Eight Asian girls sit on the steps drawing. Craig sees them and approaches them
Craig
Uhh, excuse me, why are you doing this?? [holds up a picture of himself pushing Tweek on a swing, and Tweek enjoying it]
Girl 1
"Oh, hi, Craig. 오늘 다른 셔츠 입었네. (He's wearing a different shirt today.) [looks at the girl on her right and addresses her] 잠바 밑에 어떻게 알아? (how do you know what's underneath his jacket?) [The girl replies.]
Craig
What? Well what did she say?
Girl 3
I don't know, that was Korean. I'm Japanese.
Tweek
[Over caffeinated] What is going on, huh? Huh? Me and him aren't together. Why is this happening?!
Girl 1
[girl 1 addresses the girl to her left] 지금 크렉이 같이 있어줘야 하는데". [(Craig should be along with Tweek.)]
Tweek
Everyone thinks I'm gay! What if my parents find out! Huh!
PC Principal's Office. Craig and Tweek are seated across from PC Principal and Mr. Mackey
PC Principal
Alright guys, I know there have been a lot of rumors flyin' around. Just wanted to check in, see if you have any questions for me.
Craig
Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay?
PC Principal
What's wrong with being gay? Nothin' wrong with that.
Craig
But we aren't! I'm not!
Tweek
I'm not either!
PC Principal
That is completely irrelevant! Okay? What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, is that you understand affirmative consent.
Tweek
What's that?
PC Principal
IF there is a romantic relationship here, you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration.
Tweek
Gah!
PC Principal
Now, in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier, but you still have to follow some guidelines, alright?
Craig
But I'm not gay!
PC Principal
I don't care about that, bro! Tweek, if, and I'm only saying if, at some point you wanted to touch Craig's penis, you can't just go grabbin' for it. Alright? You need to say something like "Craig, is it alright with you if I touch your penis?" Okay? Let's try it out.
Tweek
NO!
PC Principal
You want two weeks' detention instead?! This shit's important!
Tweek
Craig, can I touch your penis?
PC Principal
Okay, good. Now Craig, you might say "You may touch my penis. I'm comfortable with that." [Craig isn't happy with that line and waits for more] Or of course, you could say "No, you may not touch my penis at this time."
Craig
No you may not!
PC Principal
Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Now Craig, what would you say if you wanted to take a gander at Tweek's asshole?
The Marsh house. Randy looks inside the fridge for something to drink. He gets a bottle of gluten-free PBR. Sharon walks up to him
Sharon
Randy, you should have a talk with Stan.
Randy
For what?
Sharon
I guess something happened at school today involving two of Stan's friends,.. being gay?
Randy
What?
Sharon
Yeah. Stan seems really perplexed.
Randy
Wow. Our town has only had a Whole Foods for three weeks and we already have our first gay kids. So cool. [smiles to himself]
Sharon
Go talk to him, Randy, and be delicate.
Stan's room, afternoon. Randy knocks on the open door softly, then walks in.
Randy
Hey bud. How's it hangin'? [sits on the bed next to Stan]
Stan
I'm confused, Dad. There was this thing at school.
Randy
Well, guess what? You've got a really progressive PC dad who knows all about this stuff, okay? Go ahead, ask me anything.
Stan
I just don't understand how it's decided.
Randy
Ah, well, you see, it's a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.
Stan
No, I mean like, what makes the Asians decide who they're gonna make gay?
Randy
[confused] The Asians? The Asians decide who's going to be gay? [feigns knowing, playing it off] Uh are y-, yeah, yeah they do. Uh, the Asians just, you know, the Asians pick who they pick, and um, it's al- it's, the way it's always been.
Stan
So you've heard of yaoi?
Randy
[embarrassed, playing it off] Yeah, of course. Yaoi, anal intercourse, Maui Zaui, I, I know all this stuff, Stan.
Shi Tpa Town, day, Whole Foods. Gerald and Sheila run into Thomas Tucker in the store.
Gerald
Oh hey, Thomas! Hey, we heard about Craig. We think it's just terrific.
Thomas
[turns around] What about Craig? [Stephen Stotch comes up behind him]
Stephen
Thomas! I'm so glad that Craig is finally happy. [aloud to the other shoppers] Hey, it's Craig's dad, everybody. [shoppers around the store clap]
The Tweek house. Tweek and his parents are having dinner. Tweek is twitching quite a bit and Richard notices
Richard
Tweek's out of coffee, honey.
Mrs. Tweek
Oh, here you go, kiddo. [fills Tweek's cup]
Richard
Tweek, is there anything you want to talk to us about?
Tweek
No.
Richard
[slowly] Well, we heard that you're gay. And I want you to know we've never been so proud of you.
Tweek
Oh God. [lets his head hit the table, smashing into all of his food]
Richard
We thought you were just a spaz, but to know that you've got so much going on inside.
Mom
We're so proud of you, Tweek.
Tweek
AAaaagh!
Richard
Knowing what I know now, I'm gonna be a much better dad to you. In fact, I just, I just want to give you some money, Tweek. [pulls out his wallet and then some bills] Can I give you some money? [Tweek looks up with mashed potatoes covering parts of his face] Here, I I love you so much, son. [hands Tweek the bills]
"The Book of Love" begins to play, and here's the montage: Tweek stares at the ceiling while in bed. So does Craig. Neither of them can sleep. Nor can Stan, and he rolls from one side to the other. Next day, one of the Asian girls is drawing. Next night, Thomas can't sleep. Following day Craig walks along and sees Tweek, who is looking at a wall. They look at each other, then at the wall, which turns out to be on one side of the school. On the wall is a large mural of Craig and Tweek in embrace. They turn around, then walk their separate ways. Next is an outdoor art fair at the Whole Foods parking lot with art from the Asian girls at school. All of it is of Craig and Tweek in various poses. The Broflovski's and Marshes are enjoying it. The Stotch's buy a print. Mayor McDaniel's leafs through a bunch of Tweek x Craig pictures she has in a folder, then she looks at a picture of a man with a mustache. She smiles at it. Next is more fan art of Craig and Tweek, and finally we get to Cartman in bed
Cartman
[thinking] Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass?
Cupid Me
[flits in out of nowhere] Aw come on. What's wrong with two guys liking each other?
Cartman
I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?
Cupid Me
But if love is love, then it takes form in all shapes and sizes. Teehee.
Cartman
I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along.
Cupid Me
Really? Can I?
Cartman
Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you.
Cupid Me
Oh thank you! I won't! [floats out and away, giggling all the while.]
Craig's room. Craig is sound asleep, wearing his cap. Cupid Me flits in
Cupid Me
You just need a little spark of magic. [shoots an arrow into Craig's head.] And now I'm gonna pee in your mouth. [does so and giggles] Love is in the air. [squeezes a last bit of pee out]
Cartman's bathroom. Cartman is on the toilet doing something on his phone. Cupid Me returns.
Cartman
Did you do it, Cupid-Me?
Cupid Me
I hit him with my love arrow, and then I peed in his mouth just for fun.
Cartman
[laughs] That's awesome! [chuckles as Cupid-Me flits to his left side] That's so sweet.
Cupid Me
I thought you might like that.
Cartman
Yeah, dude. You're hilarious.
Cupid Me
And do you think I'm cute, too? 'Cause I think you're kind of cute.
Cartman
[his smile vanishes] Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny.
Cupid Me
Oh well, at least Tweek and Craig are in love now. [flits away]
Cartman
Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting.
South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Stan is talking to Kyle, who is switching out books in his locker.
Stan
And so my dad talked to me about it.
Kyle
Yeah?
Stan
And my dad said that Asians have always done this, and they, like, do make people gay.
Cartman
[runs up to them] You guys! You guys, hurry!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex! [runs off. Stan and Kyle follow.]
At the intersection of two hallways, a crowd has gathered around Tweek and Craig.
Craig
Got a fuckin' problem man?! [pushes Tweek back]
Tweek
You're the one with the fuckin' problem! [pushes Craig back]
Craig
I told you to stay a hundred yards from me!
Tweek
You'd better not fuckin' push me again, man!
Cartman
Oh-ho come on, you guys. Get a room. [Craig and Tweek start fighting. Soon Cartman grabs onto Kevin for support]
PC Principal's office, day. He's got the phone receiver in one hand, a hand grip in the other
PC Principal
Hello Mr. Tucker. I need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today.
Thomas
[at his office.] Craig? Craig got in a fight? [grins]
PC Principal
Yes, with his boyfriend. Just a lovers' quarrel, probably. [Craig and Tweek are seated opposite]
Craig
Goddammit!
PC Principal
Something to be expected in relationships. Apparently there were no affirmative consent issues, as your son knows the right way to play with another boy's penis.
Thomas
Oh God...! [facepalm]
PC Principal
There's not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay. We wanna be supportive, so we're just gonna send them on home with some money, alright? Alright, you have a nice day.
Thomas
Money?
The Forbidden City, China, day. A woman walks into an office and addresses someone in there. The camera pans left to show the president of the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping. Apparently, it's a call for him, and he answers his phone
Xi Jinping
Wei? Ni hao [(Hello? Who is there?)]
Randy
[on the other end, in his study] Uh, hi, Mr. Jinping. Thanks for taking my call, I was... just wondering if you could shed some light on how your people decide who will be gay and who will be straight.
Xi Jinping
What?
Randy
[sighs] I'm sorry, I-I don't speak Asian, but... um, oh uh, oh, y-yao, yaoi. Yaoi, yes? Boizu rabu. Huh, how does that work?
Xi Jinping
That-a come from-a Japan.
Randy
Oh, it's Japan that decides? [Stan walks into the study.] How the hell do they actually make people geh-? [notices Stan] Aaaa-a-ah, Japan. Of course, is who does the yaoi to make people gay.
Xi Jinping
They are dogs! [pounds his desk with his left fist] who refused, and not apologized, to the Chinese republic!
Randy
Uh huh, yes, that of course I do already know about homosexuality.
Cartman's house, day. Cartman is browsing the Web on his phone. The doorbell rings and Liane goes to the front door to answer it
Delivery Man
Hi, flower delivery for Eric Cartman? [Cartman hears this and looks over]
Liane
Oh my, how beautiful. [signs for the flowers and takes them to Cartman] Oh look sweetie, someone sent you flowers.
Cartman
[sets his phone down, takes the bouquet, and reads the attached note.] "Can't we just try? Tee Hee." Oh man.
Liane
Who are they from, hon?
Cartman
Someone who needs a real talking to.
At the buffet restaurant. Cartman and Cupid Me are in a booth
Cartman
Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing.
Cupid Me
Teeheehee. Aw, come on, let's be like Tweek and Craig. Everyone thinks they're kewl.
Cartman
You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
Cupid Me
But I'm so attracted to you.
Cartman
I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me. [the smile leaves Cupid Me's face. Cartman's voice gets quieter] This... is done. I'm just not a homosexual. [dejected, Cupid Me goes limp in mid-air.]
The Tweek house, day. The doorbell rings and Richard goes to answer it. Craig is just outside.
Richard
Well, hello Craig. Honey, it's Craig.
Mom
Awww, hi Craig.
Craig
Is Tweek home?
Richard
He sure is. Come on in. [holds the door open for Craig. From his house, Randy gives Richard a thumbs up. Richard returns the gesture and closes the door, then joins Mrs. Tweek and Craig in the middle of the living room] Would you like to have some coffee, Craig?
Craig
No thank you, I just want to see Tweek.
Mom
Awww.
Richard
Tweek's just up in his room playing. You can go on up. [Craig starts going upstairs] Oh, uh, but keep the door open, alright? [Craig gets mad at the insinuation. Richard says to his wife] They're so gay.
Tweek's room, moments later. Tweek is trying to put some Lego's together, but it's frustrating for him. He drinks more coffee. Craig enters the room.
Craig
Hey dude. [this makes Tweek spit out his coffee, and he gets off his chair]
Tweek
No, no! What are you doing here? [keeps his distance]
Craig
Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this.
Tweek
There's no stopping it! The whole world wants me to be something I'm not!
Craig
Me too, dude! But there's something we can do.
Tweek
What??
Craig
We have to come out and say we're gay.
Tweek
What?! Are you insane?! The way everyone-!
Craig
Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures! We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls.
Tweek
Like acting? No man, that is way too much pressure! I'll fail-
Craig
You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think.
Tweek
Agh. I'm a terrible actor.
Craig
You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay?
Tweek
Oh gah-okay. Oh God!
Skeeter's Wine Bar, day. Thomas Tucker is at the bar with Skeeter and Darryl Weathers.
Thomas
What did I do wrong, huh? Everyone's so damned happy, but... but why did this have to happen to my son?! What did I do to make my son like this?
Randy
Hey, hey, whoa, you didn't do anything.
Thomas
Oh what? You know about this?
Randy
Yeah, let me handle this guys, I'm PC. Look Thomas, you need to understand that being gay isn't a decision. You know, a lot of people think that Asians decide who's gay and who's not. But it isn't all Asians, it's just specifically the Japanese, okay?
Thomas
What?
Randy
[turns around] Why do the Japanese make some people gay and others not? [turns around again] Well, it all goes back to World War II, and atrocities that happened in China called the Rape of Don King.
Skeeter
Hey, you sure know a lot about this.
Randy
Yes I do.
The school hallway, at that moment. The same seven boys are gathered there again
Kyle
No dude, I looked it up. Yaoi is just an art style for girls by girls because they like fictionalizing two guys in a relationship.
Stan
But why?
Kyle
I don't know. But the point is, there's nothing about it that means Tweek and Craig are actually gay, at all.
The school lobby, later. The Asian girls are back on the steps, and three of them are smiling. Tweek walks past them and stops when he hears someone calling him
Craig
Hey Tweek! Hold up. Listen, it's just not going to work. [the smiles vanish]
Tweek
What? Why not? [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Davíd, and Butters arrive]
Craig
I'm sorry Tweek, but we can't lie to ourselves anymore. [turns to face the gathering crowd of kids] Yes, we are gay, but we do not belong together.
Tweek
We don't belong together? What suddenly changed, Craig?
Craig
It's just that people are different. That's all.
Tweek
Uh huh. And who the hell is Michael?! Huh?! You wanna tell me that?! [jaws begin to drop]
Craig
What? What are you, what are you talking about?
Tweek
I went through your phone when we went out last night, Craig! I saw your texts to Michael about hooking up with him!
Craig
Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened.
Tweek
Oh, it's not?
Craig
No. [tries to get Tweek back on track] Uh look, we both know this is for the better.
Tweek
Oh, don't use that lame shit on me, man! You don't wanna feel bad, so you try and tell me what I want?
Craig
Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here.
Tweek
[tears up, voice cracks] Noho, you're not the bad guy! You're never the bad guy, are you?! You, you just step on people and you use them!
Craig
[tries again] You're going too far, dude. This is like, totally not necessary.
Tweek
Agh-I'm going too far?! What is wrong with you?
Craig
This wasn't part of the plan!
Tweek
Well guess what, Craig! Love doesn't follow a plan!
Butters
Yeah!
Tweek
[tears fill his eyes] I was totally wrong about you. I opened myself up and let you in. But you've got spikes, man. You've got spikes. [walks away. Before he goes off screen, he breaks out in a big grin.]
Wendy
[steps forward to Tweek's spot] Tweek. [glares at Craig, then follows Tweek concerned. Craig looks at the other kids, who glare at him and walk away. The Asian girls even leave their drawing tools behind]
Craig
Dude, seriously? Seriously?
"Say Something" begins to play. A rainy-day montage begins. First, the Tucker house. Mrs. Tucker is on the phone.
Mrs. Tucker
They... they broke up? [Thomas turns around and smiles at the news. He notices Craig walking up to the front door, head down, and lets him in. He notices Craig's mood and his smile disappears.]
The montage continues. The mural on the side of the school begins to smear. An Asian girl cries as she draws something new - Tweek and Craig with their backs to each other, with some distance between them. Tweek walks through the hallway grinning at first, but his smile vanishes when he notices how sad the other kids look. The outdoor art fair is still open on a rainy day. Most of the art now has an angry Craig and a dejected Tweek on it. One piece has Craig talking to a new boy while Tweek looks in from outside, and another has Craig pushing pins into a Tweek plush as if it were a voodoo doll. Next, Cupid Me looks in from outside as Cartman is asleep in bed. Cupid Me flits away. Gerald and Sheila replace a happy Craig x Tweek painting with a breakup one. Stan is shown sad on his bed, while Sharon is shown sad in the kitchen. Randy appears at the doorway and opens his mouth to say something, but decides against it and walks away. Mayor McDaniels is at her husband's grave. Richard Tweek is crying at the dining room table and his wife tries to console him. Tweek picks in from the kitchen
Ruffians Gay Bar, day. Some men are playing pool, two others chat next to the jukebox. Cartman walks in, scans the room, and walks up to the bar
Cartman
What are you doing? This place isn't you. [Cupid Me is shown, with a mug of beer an empty scotch glass, and an ashtray full of cigarette butts.]
Cupid Me
I'm just here to pick up on guys. Why? are you jealous?
Cartman
No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
Cupid Me
Oh, now you need me, huh? Fuck you, dude.
Cartman
Fuck you.
Man 1
What is that kid doing here?
Man 2
He's just kind of talking to himself.
Cartman
The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help.
Cupid Me
Well, I guess I could try now, in return for just... one date?
Cartman
[hushed shouting] I'm not homosexual!
Cupid Me
Then I guess I'm not interested.
Cartman
Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together.
Cupid Me
Teeheehee! Teeheeheeheehee!
Bartender
Hey kid, what do you think you're doing here?
Cartman
Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay? [the bartender doesn't see any friend with him]
The Tucker house, day. The doorbell rings and Thomas arrives to answer it. Tweek is just outside
Tweek
Hi, is Craig here, sir?
Thomas
Why can't you quit him? [begins to close the door-]
Mrs. Tucker
Thomas!
Thomas
[lets Tweek in] Five minutes. He's in the back. [Tweek goes on in and goes out the sliding door in back. Craig is working on his bicycle.]
Tweek
Hey dude.
Craig
What do you want?
Tweek
I thought when we broke up everything would get better. I was thinking maybe, we should say we're back together.
Craig
Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you!
Tweek
What does that have to do with anything?
Craig
You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back?
Tweek
You said to make it seem real.
Craig
Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks!
Tweek
I'm so sorry, Craig. You, you made me believe in myself in a way I never have before. I didn't think I had any of that in me, but... you were right. I can do more than I think. You... changed something in me and I just... I wanna fix whatever's hurting you now. [Thomas, who's been looking out the window, begins to cry]
Craig
I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else.
Tweek
Alright Craig. Alright. [turns left and walks away]
The Tucker House
Thomas
I can see how much they're both hurting, but... Can't you understand that in my time we just didn't accept this? [rests his head on his left hand] Maybe it's not so wrong, I, I just don't want it to be my son. [Cupid Me flits in and giggles]
Cupid Me
You just need a little prick of magic. [shoots an arrow into Thomas' head] And I'll pee in your mouth a little bit. [follows through]
Thomas
Then again, he's my son no matter what. I can't just shut down on him.
Cupid Me
Teeheeheehee, teeheeheehee. [flits away. Moments later, Thomas shows up at Craig's bedroom door. Craig is on his bed, sad]
Thomas
[enters] Son, you need to listen to me. [sits down on the bed] You can't fight being gay. I used to think that being gay was a choice, but, you don't get to decide. Japan picks who they pick, and that's that. I don't understand this stuff. Heck, I didn't even know Don King got raped, but... I do know that if you try and resist it, you make yourself miserable your whole life. Everyone was so proud of you, Ah I was just being selfish. I wanna be proud of you too. I like gay Craig. I love you. Here's a hundred dollars. [puts the bill in Craig's hand and walks out the door]
Japanese singer
Maybe we should go away.Put cares aside for just a day.

Gerald and Sheila meet in front of a painting of Tweek and Craig, and hold hands
Japanese singer
The world we face is a-not so big.
Not if we are strong like Tweek and Craig.
Honto ni sekanda ga oichii

Randy brings a bouquet of flowers to Sharon in the kitchen. Craig and Tweek play a video game
Japanese singer
Let's go back to when it was new.
Weren't we such happy peopleru?
Life was simple, problems vague. [several adults look through a window at Craig and Tweek as they play]
We had it all, a lot like Tweek and Craig. [Mayor McDaniels looks at the picture of her deceased husband, then holds it against her chest.]

At school, heads turn as Craig and Tweek walk through the hallways hand in hand. Next, in Akihabara, Japan, the singer is shown in a karaoke restaurant, singing the lyrics on a video featuring live action of Tweek and Craig
Japanese singer
And in the darkness we all seek
A perfect love like Craig and Tweek. We must fight or love's a goner. We must hold Tweek and Craig with the Highest honor! [Thomas suddenly walks up] Gambaro Irashai! I hope you know when you are down [Xi Jinping, at his desk, suddenly gets up and kisses his secretary] That you turned my life around. [Butters is Skyping with Charlotte] Just like the quote from Shakespeare said I'm your Tweek, [slowing] and you're my Craig.

Cartman
[in bed, moaning in a rhythmic fashion] Okay, okay, the date's almost over.
Cupid Me
[pops up behind Cartman] Teeheehee. Aren't you liking your massage?
Cartman
It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
Cupid Me
Well, I've got something you might like a little better. [goes back behind Cartman... and under...]
Cartman
Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!
Cupid Me
Teeheeheehee!
Cartman
Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God! [next, he's in the bathroom. Liane walks past, but stops to listen in] Oh Cupid Me, that's enough! Okay, that's it, Cupid Me! That's it! [Liane opens the door and sees Cartman masturbating furiously on the toilet] That's it, Cupid Me. Okay, that's it. That's it, Cupid Me. [Liane closes the door]
Liane
Awww.
End of Tweek x Craig

Naughty Ninjas
South Park, day. Two police officers are patrolling the town in their vehicle
Sgt. Yates
Attention all units in the vicinity of South Park Elementary! [the officers pay attention] We have a code red! [units begin showing up] Principal calling for help during school assembly! All officers needed at once!
Officer Barbrady
[in his patrol car eating a sub sandwich and drinking soda] The school? [puts down his food and starts the motor] Oh Jeez Louise! [turns his siren on and drives off. More units arrive at the school, even heavily-armed SWAT officers. They all arm themselves. Barbrady runs into one of the other cars]
Sgt. Yates
[to the assembled officers] We need to get to the gym! Half go this way, half go around the side! Barbrady, you go around back! [the officers disperse. Barbrady goes into the school and finds empty hallways. He stops for a moment and one can hear him pant. He barges into the Fourth Grade classroom and finds it deserted. He goes through the school lobby and finds no one.]
Officer 1
On 3 1... 2... [Instead of getting to 3, the officers enter the gym with their weapons drawn. More cops enter from the other end.]
PC Principal
There she is, officers, right there. I told you to stop chatting with your friend, didn't I, Leslie? You [Leslie looks at him, bewildered] see, officers, apparently Leslie thinks that talking to her friends is more important than learning about diversity in third-world countries. [pulls out a laser pen light and lights Leslie up with it.] That one. That's her right there. You remove her from my school.
Barbrady
[barges into the gym] Whoa! Nobody move! What's happening?
PC Principal
Get her out of here! [the light from his pointer falls upon Barbrady]
Barbrady
Oh, they've got me! [reflexively fires a shot, which hits a boy on the right shoulder]
Boy
AAAAAH!
PC Principal
Waaaah!
South Park City Hall, later. The Mayor, her aides, and two other people
Mayor McDaniels
This town is outraged, Officer Barbrady! People are tired of the police not being held accountable for their actions!
Barbrady
Mayor, I didn't know if there was a gunman, or a bomb-
Mayor McDaniels
You shot an unarmed six year old Latino child!
Barbrady
I'm sorry.
Mayor McDaniels
You're fired.
Barbrady
No, Mayor, please. This is all I know. I used to be the only policeman in this town, remember? Bob, ah I used to chase away the sixth graders for you.
Mayor McDaniels
You're from another time, Barbrady. And the last thing that needs to go. Your gun and your badge. [Barbrady takes them and lays them on the table] And your sunglasses.
Barbrady
[emotional] No, please, not my sunglasses.
Johnson
You're done, Barbrady! The town doesn't want you here! [reluctantly, Brabrady takes off his sunglasses and lays them on the table.]
Barbrady
Where should I go?
Johnson
You should have thought of that before you shot a Mexican!
Mayor McDaniels
Latino-American.
Johnson
Latino-American. [blinks hard] Shit.
Mayor McDaniels
You should go away. You don't belong anywhere in a town as progressive as this one.
SoDoSoPa, at Kenny's house. The mall and construction sites are still there, but the homeless have moved in. Kenny opens the door to take the trash out.
Homeless Man 1
[sleeping upstairs at the abandoned Steed] Aaay, quiet down over there, I'm tryin' to sleep.
Stuart
[steps outside] Goddammit! You people all get out of here!
Homeless Man 2
[sleeping upstairs at "Bi the garage"] What makes you in charge? [Karen appears at the living room window]
Stuart
'Cause this is my fuckin' house!
Homeless Man 3
[kicks a trashcan and walks over to him] Hey beat it, man, or I'll make you my bitch! [Karen screams. Stuart gets Kenny back inside and Karen leaves the window.]
The McCormick living room. Stuart places a call as his family stands to one side watching him.
Stuart
Yeah, we've got a bunch of drunk-addict vagrants trespassing on our yard and we need assistance.
Sgt. Yates
[in his office] Oh, is that so? Well, we'd like to come help you, but we don't wanna get fired.
Stuart
What are you talkin' about? There's homeless people here and they're scarin' my kids! You need to come do somethin' about this!
Sgt. Yates
I see. And are any of these homeless people of a minority persuasion?
Stuart
Why does that matter?
Sgt. Yates
Oh, it matters. See, it used be we could beat up minorities and nobody cared. It's the reason a lot of us joined the force. [lowers the phone a bit] Hey Mitch, you wanna go down and arrest some homeless people but not be able to beat up any minorities?
Mitch
No thank you.
Sgt. Yates
Yeah, no, I think we're good. In fact, we're thinking of maybe turning the whole department into a hula school. Whattaya think?
Stuart
God Dammit! [slams the phone down onto the base unit]
Mrs. McCormick
What are they doing?
Stuart
They're not coming!
Mrs. McCormick
But they have to! Karen brought in one of their syringes, for Christ's sake!
Stuart
Well that's just too bad! The cops won't come, so there's nobody to scare the homeless away!
turns around and walks away. Kenny lowers his head and looks down and to the right
Officer Barbrady's apartment. He walks in and sets his sack lunch over the TV, then takes off his jacket and puts it on the coat rack
Barbrady
Hi, sweetheart. I've uh... I've been let go from the force. I'm so sorry.[an old dog raises its head and lets out a small groan. He walks over to it] Don't worry, old girl. [kneels down next to the dog and starts stroking it] It might be a little tough to afford your medication, but I'll find a way. You know me. I like to help. I like to be needed.
Neighborhood park, day. Stan and Kyle are shooting hoops. Kyle takes a shot and misses. Cartman runs up to them.
Cartman
You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay! [Butters catches up] They're totally gay!
Stan
Who?
Cartman
Kenny and Token.
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Kenny and Token, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me.
Kyle
You're lying.
Cartman
No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away.
Kyle
How is that gay?
Cartman
It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!
Butters
Over this way! [they all go have a look]
SoDoSoPa, later. Two ninjas spring into view and go to two posts around the edge of the roof.
Token
We will defend our ninja honor! [spotting something over a crossbow] Intruders! Protect the base! [the four boys come into view] Hey guys, did you come to see our ninja fortress?
Cartman
[in hushed tones] Oh my God they're so gay you guys.
Stan
You and Kenny built all this?
Token
Yeah, with Clyde and David too. [Clyde swings into view while David climbs up a rope.]
Clyde
You guys should come and check it out.
Cartman
Ah, no, we're good, thanks. [in hushed tones] Oh my God this is a sausage party!
Clyde
It's pretty cool, dude. People are scared of us.
Cartman
[sarcastically] Yeah, I'm sure they are. [a big truck stops in its tracks.]
Driver
Hey, excuse me, man, do you know where-? [Arabic music plays and the ninjas began showing off their moves.] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAH! Look! AAAAH!
Passenger
Go, go, go! [the truck takes off. The four boys look on in wonder, Cartman walks into the street. The truck reaches the end of the block and hangs a left, and disappears]
Cartman
That's pretty cool.
Skeeter's Wine Bar, evening. Skeeter serves up some wine
Gerald
Well the way I heard it was that the girl in the school wasn't even doing anything. Just talking too loud. And someone ends up getting shot.
Skeeter
Hey! What you want?
Barkley
It's okay, I'm off duty. Just came in for a nice pinot.
Patron
Yeah? Well go somewhere else, copper! CtPaTown is for people who care about each other!
Skeeter
We don't take kindly to folks who impose their authority on the underprivileged!
Barkley
Now look, not all cops are racist trigger-happy assholes.
Randy
Really? I'll bet you don't even know what "farm to table" means. [Barkley stands there a moment and then walks out, letting the door slam shut. Bar patrons cheer and holler at their success]
Randy
[steps forward] Wow. We've only had a Whole Foods for a month and already we don't need cops. So cool. [smiles]
SoDoSoPa, day. Token is giving a lesson.
Token
It is a great honor to see that you all want to be ninjas. Joining our club is very serious. You must promise to uphold the warrior's code. [Butters and Cartman, Stan and Kyle are now dressed as ninjas]
Cartman
Totally dude, ninjas are sweet.
Token
Together we must strive to make our fortress super bad-ass and keep all intruders out! To that end, let us proceed to our training.
Cartman
[catches up to a ninja] Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him.
Kyle
You're talking to Kyle right now.
Cartman
Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters.
Kyle
You're the one who said ninjas were gay. Why do you wanna make this a problem?
Cartman
I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things.
Butters
Hey Eric, you wanna try sparring with me?
Cartman
Yes I do, Butters. [kicks him in the nuts and walks away]
Butters
OOF. Ow. Ahem.
Clyde
Intruders! [two homeless men approach the fortress with filled grocery bags]
Homeless Man 4
Yeah, it's right up here. We can shoot up in these abandoned buildings. [the ninjas, eight in all, appear before them and make a show of force. The men begin to confuse them for ISIS, drop their bags, and run away]
A news break
Anchor
The town of South Park is holding a large protest tonight outside of their police department. The townspeople say the protest is meant to begin a dialog about the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens they are supposed to protect.
A montage begins to "Fuck the Police" playing in the background. The protest is shown, with everyone giving the middle finger to the cops. Even Fr. Maxi gives them the finger. Yates and his men look down from their second-story windows. Next, Whole Foods is shown. A shopper spots Officer Stevens and throws his cart right at him. Stevens turns around to see what hit him. The shopper feigns shock, then shrugs his shoulders and turns and walks away. Other shoppers laugh at his prank. Next is (vernacular), where a couple sits al fresco. They watch as Stevens sees his police car, now vandalized with "I'M A DOUCHE". Next is Officer Barbrady at home with his aged dog. Next, Sgt. Yates reads the South Park times. Its lead headline: NO TO PIGS! YES TO FREE-RANGE PORK. Next, two officers drive down a street when they spot someone. It's Randy in his bathrobe, standing outside, He shows off his cock and balls as the officers roll by slowly. ShiTpaTown is shown. Barbrady drops into a fast-food restaurant to look for work. The staff there quickly kicks him out. Two homeless men approach SoDoSoPa only to flee when they see the ninja kids swarming the place. Barbrady returns to find an eviction notice taped to his door. Randy reaches Whole Foods for some shopping, but finds a homeless man in his way sleeping on the sidewalk. Then he looks at Whole Foods and sees the parking area filled with homeless people
Channel 4 News segment.
Anchor
Are your children being lured into terrorist organizations? A shocking report shows that some kids in the town of South Park are swearing loyalty to a murderous regime.
Cartman
Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool.
Reporter
And what about this way of life has attracted you?
Butters
We're just cool 'cause we're tough, and we fight and stuff, and we can ah-.
Cartman
Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!
Stan
Then why'd you say it was gay before?
Cartman
Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
Token
Wait, he said this was gay?
Cartman
That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?! [points to Stan] He's a lying, backstabbing Jew!
Stan
I'm Stan.
Anchor
No doubt the growing number of kids swearing loyalty to ISIS could be problematic for the progressive town.
Whole Foods, day. Barbrady takes his place among the homeless, up against an exterior wall.
Barbrady
[to his dog] Here you go, old girl. We'll just have to make do. [Randy exits the store with some groceries, but fails to notice Barbrady nearby]
Randy
Ew. [keeps walking]
Homeless Man 5
Spare a dollar?
Randy
No I don't I'm sorry thank you Goddammit ew. [the Mayor and her aides survey the situation by Skeeter's Bar. Randy sees her and approaches] Mayor, I didn't bust my ass to gentrify this part of town to have it overrun with homeless people!
Mayor McDaniels
Why are they all suddenly coming here?
Gerald
[arrives with Sheila] Mayor, what are you going to do about this? My wife and I can barely eat or shop.
Mayor McDaniels
When a town like ours has a homeless problem it must look at the root of what's causing it.
Stephen
[arrives with Linda] It's ISIS!
Randy
What?
Stephen
They're these troubled kids who've turned their backs on America! They've taken over SoDoSoPa, forced all the homeless out!
Gerald
Why would kids in our town wanna be a part of that?
Stephen
They're just bad kids! Rotten on the inside! Probably with shitty parents!
Jimmy's house. His parents are at the breakfast nook with him.
Ryan
Son, I've always tried to be a fair dad. Eh I I don't want to meh make you angry, but... why?
Jimmy
Well Dad, I just re-really like being a part of something. I feel like it's character-building and it's lots of fun.
Ryan
Fun? But what do you... believe in?
Jimmy
What do we believe in? We believe in something greater than ourselves, and that by following our strict warrior code we believe that our faiths and our traditions are a way to a greater path - the p-p-p-path of the warrior. And as long as we stay united in honor we can defeat all our enemies. [this is beginning to freak Ryan out, so he screams and leaves the table as fast as he can.] Wow, the fellas were right. People are really freaked out by ninjas.
Park County Police Station, day. Randy leads the city council to police headquarters on the second floor
Randy
Okay, we've just gotta be really apologetic and tell them we didn't mean it, okay?
Gerald
Jeez, this is so embarrassing.
Mayor McDaniels
What if they won't help us with the homeless?
Stephen
I'm pretty sure the police will help out if it's because ISIS is taking over the town. [opens the double doors and leads the council in]
Park County Holice Headquarters. The officers inside are all dancing slowly, gracefully, The city council is stunned
Stephen
Officers, there's kids in town who have joined ISIS. We don't know who they are, but they-.
Sgt. Yates
What? What's that, you say?
Mayor McDaniels
The town is in danger, alright? We don't know what these kids are capable of.
Sgt. Yates
Jeez, I'm sorry. We've got to work on our koholo kaloa, and get the lomi lomi chicken ready for the big ho'olao le'ao, which leaves us... oh, not enough time to deal with ISIS.
Randy
Alright, look. There's homeless people all over our gentrified food and arts district. If you don't stop thewe twisted kids, then-
Sgt. Yates
Hey, who was it that said "fuck the police"? Was that Ice Cube? Tupac? Oh, right, that was you guys! Sorry, but I guess you'll have to find somebody else to do all the difficult dirty shit you don't want to do yourselves. I've gotta be ready for the luau. I might even kiss a dude.
Back at SoDoSoPa, the ninjas are going through exercises. Cartman and Butters talk
Cartman
So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?
Butters
Yeah?
Cartman
And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?
Butters
Uh I thought you said it first.
Cartman
No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters.
Token
You guys! You guys!
Stan
What?
Token
Actual Ninjas. Wanna talk to us.
Clyde
What?
Token
Kenny and I both just got the same email from people overseas.
Cartman
Whoa, dude.
Stan
How's they found out who we were?
Cartman
They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!
At Bi the garage, a computer is set up for video conferencing. An ISIS leader appears on screen.
ISIS Leader
So, you are the brave children who have committed to our cause. We are aware of what you are doing and we are very impressed.
Stan
Cool. Thanks, dude.
ISIS Leader
What you are doing is very important and we would like to help you however we can. We are going to be wiring you some money.
Butters
Whoa, cool! Why, this is the greatest thing ever you guys!
Cartman
Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?
ISIS Leader
Of course.
Cartman
Should Jews be trusted? [no response. A few seconds later...] Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic?
ISIS Leader
Extremely.
Cartman
YES! [dances away] YEEES! ["Can't Touch This" begins to play and Cartman does arm waves.] Oh—oh, oh—oh! Oh—oh, oh—oh! What did I tell you guys?
Whole Foods, night. A closeup of Barbrady snoozing
Randy
[his shadow falls upon ex-Officer Barbrady] Hey Barbrady. [tries to wake him up] Officer Barbrady.
Barbrady
Uh, who?
Randy
Hey buddy. [flanking him are the Mayor and her aides, and the Stotches]
Barbrady
What do you want?
Johnson
How would you like to be a policeman again?
Barbrady
I'm no good as a policeman. I'm a bumbling old fool.
Stephen
That is not true! Who said that? Look, Barbrady, the fact is, the town needs you.
Barbrady
They need me? To do what?
Randy
We need you to shoot some kids. [smiles]
Barbrady
No! Shoot kids? I don't wanna shoot kids!
Randy
Shh! Shhh! Shhhh! These are really bad kids. Terrorists. This is totally different from before.
Barbrady
No. No. Are any of them minorities?
Aide
A couple of them, we think. Yeah.
Barbrady
Noo no no no no no no no no!
Mayor McDaniels
Sh, look, look look, Barbrady, Barbrady! We were wrong about you. I... was wrong about you. You... protected this town back before anybody else ever did. You used to do it all on your own. We need you to do that again. [takes out his sunglasses from her inside coat pocket and hands them to him. He puts them on and his sadness disappears]
Randy
You're the only cop this town needs, Barbrady. Go shoot those kids.
SoDoSoPa, night. The ninjas are still going through exercises, but inside the abandoned Savor The Goodness store. Something is standing next to the punching bags
Cartman
You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this. [pulls out a drawing of two ninjas, one of them having anal sex with the other one] It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja. [reveals the, uh, guilty ninja, who's strapped into a chair and his ninja head covering is duck-taped over his face] Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar.
Kyle
I'm right here. [standing between Token and Stan]
Cartman
[looks at the group, then at the bound ninja] Who, who is this?
Stan
That's Clyde.
Cartman
...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage.
Some moments later, Barbrady, now in uniform, makes it to SoDoSoPa and begins looking around. He drops down behind the vandalized station wagon.
Barbrady
Oh Jesus. ISIS, oh God.
The Marsh house, dinner time. The Marshes are at dinner, except for Stan
Marvin
This chicken tastes like shit. What'd you do to it?
Randy
Okay, okay Dad, it's not organic chicken. I'm not comfortable shopping at Whole Foods with all the homeless people there. But don't worry. That's all about to change. Soon we'll all have CtPaTown to enjoy again. Where's Stan?
Sharon
He's playing ninjas over at Kenny's house.
Randy
Ninjas? That's gay. [remembers the ISIS warriors who took over SoDoSoPa] He's playing ninjas at Kenny's house?
Sharon
Yeah.
Randy
You mean, SoDoSoPa?
Sharon
Uh huh.
Randy
[begins to think this over] Wait a minute... Ninjas... [Oriental and Arabic music alternate in his head] ...scary... gay... Scary. Gay. Scary gay scary gay.
Sharon
Randy, what are you doing?
Randy
Scary gay scary gay scary GAY. [runs out of the dining room] Staaaan!! [Shelly looks back at him]
SoDoSoPa, night. The other ninjas replace Clyde with Cartman on the chair and tie him up.
Cartman
Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle.
Kyle
Nobody ever gave a shit, you fat pig!
Token
All those in favor of Cartman being kicked out of our ninja club?
Ninjas
Hai!
Cartman
No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!
Stan
What shall we do with him? [Barbrady climbs over a wall and quickly reaches the ninjas]
Barbrady
[draws his gun] Freeze! [the ninjas turn around]
Kyle
Oh shit!
Barbrady
[trembling in fear] Please, I don't wanna shoot you. [the ninjas back away]
Stan
Cool. Don't.
Barbrady
Oh ho ho. [groans miserably and waves gun]
Ninjas
Aaahaah. [Cartman shuts his eyes and faces left]
Barbrady
I understand you feeling angry at this town. I'm getting pretty angry too. But we can't give up on it. Please boys, don't make it end violently.
Randy
[finds the ninjas and Barbrady] They're just stupid ninjas! [tackles Barbrady, who instinctively fires off a shot. David is struck.]
David
Aaa!
Barbrady
Aaahaahaaawe!
City Hall, day. The Mayor, Randy, and the city council face Barbrady
Mayor McDaniels
What were you thinking?! Boys innocently playing ninja and you pull your gun on them?
Aide
David Rodriguez was lucky to live!
Barbrady
Everybody told me they were terrorists.
Mayor McDaniels
We thought they were. But if it turns out they aren't, as a policeman, you have to figure that out!
Barbrady
But, you said you needed me to kill some kids.
Randy
Oh, he's gonna lay this on us now. I said kill some kids, but I said it as a question, remember? I said "Kill some kids?"
Mayor McDaniels
I'm sorry, but we just can't cover your ass on this one. There's going to be an investigation and ... you just don't have what it takes to be a policeman in today's times.
Johnson
Do you even know what "farm to table" means? [Barbrady takes off his glasses and lays them on the table.]
Whole Foods, day. The South Park Police Department is back on duty and taking the homeless away from ShiTpaTown
Barkley
Let's go people, you can't stay here. You are being relocated.
Homeless Man 6
Hey, you can't kick us out of here, man.
Sgt. Yates
Oh no? I'm a cop.
Randy
Thank you, officers.
Sgt. Yates
We've got a deal, right?
Mayor McDaniels
Yes. [she and Randy turn away and XXX*what do they do*XXX]
Sgt. Yates
Alright you, come on! [punches the homeless man in the face. Other officers take time to abuse the homeless people a little. One officer kicks a homeless man in the balls twice while another officer holds him, then the two officers take him away. A street sweeper rolls by collecting all the homeless who are still sleeping on the street, and even a few who are walking around]
Homeless Man 6
Aaaah!
Homeless Man 7
[being led away by an officer] Please! You can't take me back to SoDoSoPa! ISIS is there!
Officer 2
No, those were just ninjas. [they walk past the boys - Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny]
Homeless Man 7
Ninjas? Oh, that's so gay.
Cartman
I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo!
An interrogation room. Barbrady sits at a table with his dog to his left. A door opens and Barbrady looks up. An agent walks in with a folder, sits down, and sets the folder on the table
Agent
Officer Barbrady.
Barbrady
Yes?
Agent
We've been watching you. And what we see is a man who truly wants to protect his town.
Barbrady
You do?
Agent
You've been in this town longer than almost anyone. Have you noticed... changes... lately?
Barbrady
Yeah, a lot of changes.
Agent
They aren't a coincidence, officer. They are all part of a plan to take down your beloved town and everyone in it.
Barbrady
What?
Agent
What do you know about a little girl named... [takes out a picture and shows it to Barbrady] Leslie? [with PC Principal pushing her on the swing]
End of Naughty Ninjas

South Park Elementary, day. Kids are filing into school. Inside, they go to their lockers and switch out books.
PC Principal
[off-screen, but you can hear him slamming lockers shut] Who was it?! Somebody's about to get their asses kicked! [a bunch of kids run screen right.] When I find out who did this!
Butters
[runs into view towards the other fourth graders] PC Principal is on the warpath! Run for your lives! [turns right and runs down another hallway]
Stan
[to Kyle] Again?
Kyle
Oh Jesus, now what?
PC Principal
[appears at screen left and walks towards the fourth graders.] Who was it?! Huh?! Somebody better fess up RIGHT NOW! I'm gonna find out who did this! [Kyle closes his locker and begins to walk away. PC Principal notices] Broflovski! Was it you?
Kyle
Was what me, sir?
PC Principal
I just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word "retarded" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy! The word "retarded" does not belong in our school!! Who is in charge of the school paper?! 'Cause I'm about to break their fuckin' legs!
Stan
Aaah, he's in charge of the school paper. [points to his right. PC Principal turns left and faces... Jimmy. PC Principal is speechless.] You gonna break his legs, PC Principal?
Principal's office, moments later. PC Principal faces Jimmy.
PC Principal
Alright, uhh, I I guess we haven't formally met before. Uhh, the reason I need to talk with you, Jason, is because of a very important-
Jimmy
It's Jimmy, actually. My name is Jimmy, PC Principal.
PC Principal
Alright, Jim. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about the use of the R word in your school paper. [holds up the paper, on which the subject on the front page is chocolate milk being removed from the school menu, "LEAVE OUR CHOCOLATE MILK ALONE"] You see, the 'R' word is very bad.
Jimmy
Says who?
PC Principal
Says me. Right? Now I know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities. When you use the 'R' word to describe the school's lunch policy, it can hurt people's hearts. [places his hand over his heart] Can you understand that at all?
Jimmy
That was an op-ed piece in the paper written by a first grader who found the school lunch policy to be ridiculous, and he thought "r-retarded" to be the best word to describe it. As the editor of the paper, I didn't think it was right to censor the words the student used.
PC Principal
...Okay, well, from now on I'm gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out, okay?
Jimmy
No.
PC Principal
What'd you say?
Jimmy
You're new here, so you don't understand how seriously I take my job as editor of the school paper. I don't allow ads, and I don't allow anything that might t-t-t-taint the truth behind what people are thinking. i don't want people to be afraid of words if it stops them from having a dialog.
PC Principal
Look, I don't wanna get angry, okay?
Jimmy
Why? Are you uncomfortable around people with disabilities? That's okay. Lot's of people are.
PC Principal
No, I'm not. I am very not uncomfortable. Alright, look, unless I can approve your paper, it is not being distributed on campus, you got that?
Jimmy
I can't hand out the school paper in school?
PC Principal
Not unless it is approved by me. Do you understand?
Jimmy
Yep, got it.
Neighborhood, day. Jimmy went for distributing the school paper outside of school instead of letting PC Principal approve it for in-school distribution. He appears riding a small Thomas the Tank Engine scooter with small trailer behind him that holds all the papers and begins throwing copies of the paper to all the houses
Jimmy
Don't forget to read the school paper! Now delivered directly to your door. [Wendy is the first student to get the paper. Clyde is next] Super School News! [Jimmy smiles and rides away. His seventh delivery is to Butters' house. Stephen opens the door and the paper smacks him in the face. He manages to catch it though. Jimmy goes on to the PC Delta house and tosses a paper there too. A few PC Bros are lounging around outside]
PC Bro 10
What is that, bro? [the front door opens and PC Principal walks out.]
PC Principal
[picks up the paper, takes off the rubber band, and reads it. The headline there: "PC PRINCIPAL'S 'RETARDED' POLICY, by Jimmy Valmer]
Jimmy
[holds up his right middle finger at him] S-s-s-suck my dick, PC Principal! [rides away. PC Principal's bros look at the principal.]
Inside PC Delta, later. PC Principal barely contains his anger as he paces about
PC Principal
Who does this kid think he is?! Challenging me?! I said one micro-aggression to him, okay?! One little micro-aggression! But that doesn't mean I have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities!
PC Bro 4
No way, bro! That's wack!
PC Principal
But why would a person with a disability not see that what I'm trying to do is actually protect them?
PC Bro 9
Sometimes victims of oppression are so marginalized that they begin to sympathize with their oppressors.
PC Bro 11
Yeah bro.
PC Principal
You're right. This kid just needs to be shown he's being an Uncle Abel. I can always count on my PC frat brothers to have my back. Let's go PC!
PC Bros
PC Woo!
The Stotch house, night. Butters' parents are in bed. Stephen is reading the school paper, Linda is looking at her smartphone.
Stephen
Wow. [turns the page] Wow, this is so great. Have you ever read the elementary school newspaper, Linda? There's no ads, no sponsored content, no links to click on. Just news stories about what's happening. [looks at her] Did you know that the police in ShiTpaTown beat up homeless to clear them out? [returns to the paper] Do you know long it's been since I was able to just sit back and read the news? I got so used to getting news off the Internet. But I feel like I'm always trying to chase the news somehow. [sets the paper down on his laps] It's like I'm in a black void, trying to reach the news story. [he's shown doing this in a vacuum] But then the next thing I know I'm reading an ad for Geico. So I click out of that and try to read the news story but it's not a news story. It's a slide show. [for Android phones] And I'm looking at the worst celebrity plastic surgery jobs ever. So of course I want to see the next line of plastic surgery gone wrong, so I hit the arrow, but then the arrow wasn't the arrow for the next line, it was to take me to an ad for face cream. Haugh! I wanted to get a news story, but I'm reading about face cream and I try to click out of it, but the ad is following me, and it's following me all over the screen! Nooo! So I click on the close button, but it wasn't a close button, it was another slide show, and I just want to know what's happening in the Middle East, but instead, I'm looking at the top ten scariest movies of all time, and that's not the arrow for the next line, it's another ad! Aaagh! [comes back to reality] But this... this is just news. And I don't get lost in all the bullshit. Linda? [sees that she's mesmerized and shakes her] Linda!
PC Principal's office, next day. Jimmy is again in there talking to PC Principal
PC Principal
Alright Jim, I know you've been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday. I'm sure you're feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself.
Jimmy
I'm not confused at all, actually, PC Principal.
PC Principal
Okay, well, no, you are confused-
Jimmy
I'm pretty sure that you're the one, but go ahead.
PC Principal
Because you don't grasp the severity of this, and that's why I brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings. Thanks for comin' in to talk to us, Nathan.
Nathan
[takes a seat next to Jimmy] I like apples and bananas.
PC Principal
Me too, bro, me too. Nathan, could you tell Jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word "retarded"?
Nathan
It hurts my feelings because I feel bad.
Jimmy
Are you serious right now?
PC Principal
You feel bad, right. You feel like that's a no-no word, right?
Nathan
That word makes my heart piss its pants.
PC Principal
Okay, wow, that's pretty heavy. Pretty heavy, huh Jim?
Jimmy
Do you want to ask him what he means by that, or are you just pandering because you're uncomfortable around disabled people?
PC Principal
I am not uncomfortable! I simply care about a horrible, outdated word that is exclusive, ignores individuality, and equates intellectual disa-bility with being... [begins to stammer] And it's, and it's, s-spot, I need a spotter, spot me, somebody spot me bro!
Topher
[steps in and puts PC Principal's train of thought back on track] And it's, it's part of a derogatory hate speech which fosters isolation and loneliness and being part of a voice to stop the R word is not only right, but extremely important!
Nathan
I'm afraid of bears. [Jimmy is decidedly not convinced of PC Principal's sincerity]
The hallway, later. Nathan is let go first and is walking back to class. Jimmy comes around the corner and catches up to him
Jimmy
Hey Nathan, hold up. What were you doing in there?
Nathan
What do you mean, Jimmy? Are you ma-ad?
Jimmy
Come on Nathan, you and I both know you use the word "retarded" 400 times a day.
Nathan
Oh Jimmy. So righteous, aren't you? So blind to everything that's going on.
Jimmy
What are you talking about?
Nathan
Do you really think all the changes happening to this town are just coincidence? This goes so much deeper than you can possibly imagine, Jim. Everyone's about to learn the truth. And then... There's a war coming. A war, Jim. And I'm just gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it.
Mr. Mackey
Come on, boys, let's get back to class.
Nathan
I like to smell trees! [walks off.]
Channel 4 News Break.
Anchor Tom
An elementary school newspaper is making big waves as more and more people say No to news on the Internet.
Rancher
I read super school news 'cause it don't try and fool me and it's news reports aren't paid for by ad companies.
Gerald
We just feel like this is actual news, and instead of clicking on links, we're reading stories.
Stephen
I had to get away from the ads. I felt like the ads were... evolving somehow. They started knowing what I liked. What I was afraid of. I tried ad blockers, but it seemed like every time I tried to block the ads, they just got smarter. I'm never going back from Super School News.
Anchor Tom
The young editor of the paper claims that since most people now watch news reports on the Internet, they're easily distracted or even fooled by ads, [the camera pulls back to show the news report as a video on Randy's smartphone] which are finding more and more clever ways to disguise them-
Randy
Oooo, brutal celebrity mugshots. [also on the screen, "SoDoSoPa in disrepair" Randy taps on the link, which leads to a slide show of celebrity mugshots which contains 40 images. He taps on the right arrow, and it leads to the first weight-loss ad instead of the next mugshot] O-hoh it got me. Ad got me, Sharon.
The 2015 Presidential Debate
Announcer
We now return live to the 2015 Presidential Debate.
Moderator
Our next question is for you, Mrs. Clinton. Many voters believe that Syrian refugees should not be allowed into our country for security reasons. What do you think?
Hillary
Keeping our country save has become more and more difficult, but I believe there are several things that we can-
Garrison
No! You shut the hell up! You've got a dumpy butt, and seven chins. Syrian refugees are all terrorists!
Hillary
I know that our government needs to take a harder look at all-
Garrison
Yeah well, it's pretty hard to look at you! We can all agree on that!
Caitlyn
[interrupts for a bit] She looks like a donkey took a shit in her face. [goes backstage again]
Garrison
Yeh-hah, good one Caitlyn. See, what I know is that there's only one way to deal with Syrian refugees, and that is...
Everyone
Fuck them all to death!
Garrison
Thank you!! [after the debate Garrison and Caitlyn head backstage laughing] That was hilarious when you called her a pizza face.
Caitlyn
It's like a Papa John's pimple party.
Garrison
Oh, that was classic, Caitlyn. You're the best running mate ever.
Principal Victoria
[the first thing you see is her big hair] Hello, Mr. Garrison.
Garrison
Oh My God... Principal Victoria?
Principal Victoria
[now using a came, walks forward] Congratulations on the polls. We need to talk. [Dramatic music ends Act 1.]
PC Delta house, night. The place is jumping
PC Bro 12
[on the sidewalk just left of the entrance] Celebrate diversity! Woooo!
PC Bro 13
[on the balcony, right side] GO PC!
PC Delta house, inside. More partying
PC Principal
[walks in with a mic] Alright everyone, listen up. [the music shuts off and everyone falls silent] Tonight is a very special night for the PCs. We're honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities. [several disabled students are present, like Jimmy, Timmy, Francis, Lenora] I for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in today's society. but tonight is about learning and healing. So let's get to it! PC! [drops the mic. The other bros echo him and cheer]
PC Bro 7
Hey guys, I'm Brad. I'm PC Arizona State.
Jimmy
Nice to meet you, Brad. Where do you guys-?
Brad
Excuse me a second. [walks over to a pretty brunette and her friend] Hello, ladies. Thanks for coming to our event.
Ladies
Hi.
Brad
We're just tired with the way people with disabilities get treated. Can I get you some alcohol?
PC Bro 14
Yah, you know, it just bugs me when people refer to persons with disabilities as "handicapped." When I hear that word I wanna fuckin' punch them in the fuckin' face.
Blonde
That's so cool of you, wow.
PC Bro 14
Yeah. [Jimmy walks into view, but no one notices him] To me marginalizing persons with disabilities by asking them what their handicap is, is a micro-aggression no better than asking a person of color if they went to college.
Blonde
Wow, you're really progressive.
PC Bro 14
No other way to be. So uh, listen. I think you're really pretty and interesting, and I'd kinda like to take you upstairs and totally crush your pussy. Would that be acceptable to you?
Blonde
[looks away, giggling] Oh well, I, I guess it would.
PC Bro 14
No, I'm sorry, I need affirmative consent. I'll need you to say "Yes, you may take me upstairs and crush my pussy at this time." [PC Bros and their lady guests pair up and dance, some of them making out. Brad dances with two women and makes out with the redhead. Jimmy is the only disabled person left in the room]
PC Bros
PC Bros, PC. Yeah!
Dawn at PC Delta. OC Principal goes knocking on every door in the house
PC Principal
McKinsey, you got consent forms?
McKinsey
Oh yeah, right here bro. [hands him the forms through the door]
PC Principal
Rise and shine guys. If you scored last night, I'll need your consent forms. [the other bros hand him their forms through their doors] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you-whoa! Barker, did you perform cunnilingus? There's a different release form, bro.
PC Bro 15
Yup. Uh, so-, sorry. It's right here.
PC Principal
Nice.
PC Bro 11
[voice only, behind him] Bro! Aw, dude, bro!
PC Principal
What, bro?
PC Bro 11
Dude, I scored with this female and after consenting to putting her mouth on my penis, she wanted me to walk her home.
PC Principal
Yeah?
PC Bro 11
And when I got to her house she had me meet her father who is Filipino, so I asked him if he could tell me about their cultural and social dynamic to being a Filipino-American.
PC Principal
Naturally.
PC Bro 11
So he said some stuff, and then the newspaper landed on his doorstep, 'cause I guess her dad subscribes to the school newspaper, and he picked it up and I saw the headline said this!
thrusts the paper in front of PC Principal. The headline reads "'PC' STANDSD FOR PUSSY CRUSHING"
PC Principal
[grabs the paper and reads it] What the fuck is this bro?
PC Bro 11
Bro, that little kid wrote that our tolerant views and fight for social justice is just a way for us to crush puss!
PC Principal
That's not true!!
PC Bro 11
I know, bro!! We're being totally victimized!
PC Principal
That little fucker, dude!
Jimmy's house, day. someone knocks on his door, he opens it.
Representative
Hello. You're the boy responsible for the South Park Super School News?
Jimmy
That's right.
Representative
We would like to give you $26 million. [Jimmy seems interested, so he lets him in. They sit down at the coffee table and the rep opens his briefcase, taking out documents] Contracts, and the first check. We'd love to be in business with you.
Jimmy
What is this for?
Representative
I represent an organization called Geico. It's an insurance company. We think Super School News would be a great way for us to reach new customers.
Jimmy
Sorry Charlie, but I don't allow ads in my newspaper.
Representative
We've heard all about that, so we thought you could just do some ...news stories about car insurance. Just state the facts, because the truth is, everyone can save by switching to Geico.
Jimmy
That's called "sponsored content." I know the difference between the news and ads. Do you think I'm stupid?
Representative
Everyone's doing it, Jim. You're sort of the last holdout. $26 million just to write some news stories that get people thinking about their insurance coverage?
Jimmy
Sth-sth-sth, stick it up your ass!
Representative
Hm. [puts the documents back in the briefcase...] Well, they said you'd be tough. [...and brings out a gun and arms it] Do you really think you can stop ads?
Jimmy
Yes.
Representative
You can try to block ads, but they get smarter. The more we ty to shut them out, the more clever they get. There's a war coming, kid, and I'm gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it. [a bullet shoots through his head from behind. killing him where he stands. Blood begins oozing out his mouth. He falls to his knees and then onto the floor. Barbrady is in the doorway, his knees weak, but his gun drawn]
Jimmy
Officer Barbrady?
Barbrady
Come with me if you want to live! [he runs back to is car, but Jimmy is confused. Barbrady returns] Come on! Come with me if you want to live! I'm serious! [runs back to his car]
The Marsh house, day. Randy is in the kitchen browsing on his phone when Sharon appears in the kitchen doorway with a copy of the school paper in her left hand
Sharon
Do you want to explain to me what pussy crushing is?!
Randy
What?
Sharon
Your little meetings you go to at night to discuss social justice?! [drops the paper on the table. Randy picks it up and reads the front page] It's just a way to pick up on young women?!
Randy
Sh-sharon, most of the guys in my PC club are right out of college, alright? You know how college kids are. Who wrote this?
Sharon
I don't want you going over there anymore!
Randy
[stands up] I don't cheat on you, Sharon! I'm happy. Look at what's happened to our town. We have ShiTpaTown, boutique restaurants and artisan shops. We have a fucking Whole Foods, and that was all me! Diverse people are moving here, and everyone is being aware of how they talk. This is paradise, Sharon!
Sharon
[gets in his face] Is it? [turns right and walks out towards the living room, then turns around] All I know is that you've changed. Every since you joined this PC thing you just bully people. And wait for people to say anything improper so you can jump down their throats for whatever words he or she used.
Randy
He or she is an agenderphobic microagressions, Sharon. You are a bigot. [Sharon turns around and walks away again while he resumes reading the paper.]
A meeting room next to the interrogation room. The agent is there with six other agents, all looking at Jimmy. Barbrady stands off to the side against the wall.
Agent
The average human can no longer tell the difference between the news and an ad. You seem to have some mental ability that allows you to know the difference.
Jimmy
Does this have to do with me calling the school principal a pussy crusher?
Agent
The PC People are simply being manipulated, unwittingly setting the table for the new enemy of humanity.
Jimmy
You mean ISIS or ninjas?
Agent
[stands up] Something... much worse. [turns away] Have you ever felt like an ad had... intelligence? That it somehow knew what you wanted, even before you knew you wanted it? [] What if I were to tell you that ads have become smarter than us? And now they're manipulating everything we do?
Jimmy
I'd say that sounds pretty retarded.
Agent
[walks to Jimmy's end of the table, then veers away] It was our own fault. Mankind became tired of ads, so we kept inventing ways to make things ad-free. We even created ad blockers. That's when the ads had to adapt. They had to disguise themselves as news in order to survive.
Jimmy
Sponsored content?
Agent
If you really can tell the difference, then you could be the key to saving our species, Jimmy. We'd like to run a test on you.
Sponsored Content, Test 17-B
Computer
Sponsored Content, Test 17-B, Ready. Begin. [a series of news articles pop up onscreen, and Jimmy has to discern whether it's news or advertisement. "Doctor Found Dead In Apartment"]
Jimmy
That's the news. ["Dental Problems on the Rise"] That's an ad. ["Missile Test Lights Up The Sky"] That's the news. ["Vermont Experiencing Heavy Snow"] That's an ad. [a different agent clicks through the articles for him] That's the news. That's an ad. That's an ad. That's the new-oh no, that's an ad for act food. My bad.
Agent
Jesus Christ, he's off the charts.
Agent 2
Increase the intensity.
Jimmy
["Man Arrested for Murder of Entire Household"] That's the news ["Price of Precious Metal Rises Due To War"] That's an ad. News. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. News. News. Ad. Ad. Slideshow. Ad. [The test ends and the computers wind down. Jimmy's chair is pulled away from the main computer on a track.]
Agent
That's a perfect score. You are a very special child, Jimmy.
Jimmy
I prefer "handicapped," actually.
Agent
We have another child here who's special too. [a metal security shield comes down to reveal a window, and a girl on the other side of the window.] Do you know... Leslie? [she notices him on the other side of the glass and looks at him]
PC Delta house. The PC Bros are putting up yellow tape saying "SAFE SPACE - DO NOT CROSS" on it.
PC Principal
[steps outside to survey the work] Alright, that's good. Everyone get inside. Everything past here is safe space. [the bros start going inside] No reporters, no harassment. We are gonna figure this shit out. [PC Principal closes the door behind himself. Once inside, everyone is sitting around in silence. PC Principal finally speaks] All I know is that I don't speak up for minorities so that I can crush pussy.
PC Bro 16
Me neither, dude. I want social justice and now I'm being made fun of.
PC Bro 17
Yeah bro. They're taking our incredibly tolerant views and distorting them.
PC Principal
PC people are under attack. That's what this is.
PC Bro 18
Hey yeah. Bro! We're the victims now. Like, we're being marginalized. Like... that makes us pretty cool.
Topher
Yeah, I bet now we can get a lot more puss.
PC Principal
No, Topher! It's not about puss, alright?! The fuck is wrong with you?! We're being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper!
PC Bro 16
[now standing] Yeah, fuck that dude, bro!
PC Principal
Yeah. And like, if you're gonna belittle and make fun of PC people like that, then who's to say he won't do it to other marginalized groups like us? I mean, this kid could be the next Hitler. And if you guys could stop Hitler, what would you do?
PC Bro 9
I'd rip that dude apart and then go home and totally smash some puss, bro.
Other Bros
Hell yeah!
PC Principal
Nooo!
The interrogation room. Jimmy now sits opposite Leslie
Leslie
You look familiar. Don't you go to my school?
Jimmy
Yes. Uh, I'm Jimmy. Editor In Chief of Super School News. [smiles]
Leslie
I'm Leslie.
Jimmy
N, nice to finally talk to you.
Leslie
Did they bring you in and give you a bunch of tests too?
Jimmy
Yes, they did. Do you know who "they" are?
Leslie
I think they're ex-newsmen. You know, the men in suits who used to be in charge of the news.
the men are listening in on this conversation
Jimmy
I thought I recognized them.
Leslie
They told me I was special. Are you special too?
Jimmy
I prefer "handicapped."
Leslie
[makes a weird noise] I like that.
Mr. Garrison's campaign office.
Mr. Garrison
Principal Victoria, if everything you've said is true, then, why doesn't anyone know about it?
Principal Victoria
There are people who know. But they have to stay very hidden.
Mr. Garrison
I'm just havin' a hard time swallowing all this. And between me and this one over here, we can swallow just about anything.
Caitlyn
[scoffs] Oh God, you're such an asshole.
Principal Victoria
Mr. Garrison, I wasn't fired. I was replaced. This goes much higher than anyone knows.
PC Principal's office, day. He's now the one explaining things to ... someone
PC Principal
I came to this town really thinking I could make a difference. I've been called a bigot towards persons with disabilities. I've been called... [stops for an instant] Pussy-crusher, because of the behavior of a very few individuals in my PC frat. [Nathan is shown] Jimmy Valmer is off the school newspaper. I want you to take over.
Nathan
Ooooh boy!
PC Principal
And I will be reviewing your paper to make sure nobody is ever attacked the way I was again.
Nathan
I think this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
PC Principal
Jimmy almost made me lose confidence, but I know who I am. I know what I am!
PC Bro 11
[voice only] Dude! Bro! [runs into the principal's office] Oh, bro, I went online to read a news story about immigrants being discriminated against.
PC Principal
Yeah?
PC Bro 11
Well, and so I clicked on the headline and it turned out to be an ad for Reddi-Wip. so then I clicked on the button to make it go away, but then it was a link to another ad, and when i tried to cancel that, another window came up, and it was this! [approaches the desk and shows
PC Principal
Dude! [stands up and whips his glasses off] What the fuck, bro?
PC Bro 11
What does this mean, dude?
PC Principal
Bro! What the fuck, bro?!
Back at the interrogation room...
Leslie
Do you like our school, Jimmy.
Jimmy
Uh yes, Leslie, I like our school very much.
Leslie
I like our school too. I like the kids who go there.
Jimmy
Uh huh. I'm starting to wonder something about you, Leslie.
Leslie
I'm starting to wonder about you. I mean, you seem like a nice kid, but... don't you feel like you could be happier? [this sets off an alarm in him]
Jimmy
Holy. Shit.
Leslie
What?
Jimmy
Can you excuse me for a moment?
Leslie
Okay. [Jimmy leaves the room for a moment]
Agent
Well Jimmy? What do you think?
Jimmy
[looks over his shoulder] Does she know she's an ad?
Agent 3
He can spot them.
Jimmy
Does she know she's an ad?!
PC Delta house, night. PC Principal is looking at his monitor, on which is the same picture he saw at school. It's the same picture as that of Naughty Ninjas, but with additional details. The camera pans out to reveal that the picture is part of a State Farm insurance ad.
PC Principal
[softly, looking truly victimized now] What the hell is going on, bro?!
PC Bro 19
[stops by and checks in on him] Bro?
PC Principal
Bro, what the hell is going on, bro?
Caitlyn Jenner's car, Washington D.C., night.
Principal Victoria
If we're going back, remember: we don't know who we can trust.
Mr. Garrison
If they wanna mess with my town, I'll fuck every last one of them! Let's do this!
Caitlyn
Buckle up, buckaroos! [revs up the motor and drives off running over several people]

South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade, day. The new teacher, Mrs. Nelson is writing out a lesson on adverbial clauses on the chalkboard
Mrs. Nelson
Alright guys, now let's go back and talk about infinitives [begins writing the lesson on that subject]. Remember, those are verbs combined with the work "to."
Cartman
[yawns and whispers to Kyle] Oh, my fucking God...
Mrs. Nelson:
Now, usually an infinitive acts like a noun, as in "I want TO go out to eat" or [Cartman tugs on Kyle's pen, making him mess up, and smiles. Kyle pulls the pen away. Cartman pulls again] "I hope TO be chosen today."
Kyle
What?
Cartman
I'm so bored, dude.
Mrs. Nelson
Now usually, it isn't common to split TO and the verb, but sometimes you can, [Cartman pulls the pen out of Kyle's hand and throws it away],
Kyle
Knock it off!
Mrs. Nelson
as in-. Is there a problem, guys?
Kyle
Go get my pen, fatass
Cartman
I am not your slave, Kyle.
Kyle
Go get my pen!
Mr. Mackey
[over the PA system] Attention, students. Kyle Broflovski report to the Principal's office please?
Cartman
[laughs] PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!
Mr. Mackey
Kyle Broflovski to the Principal's office please, m'kay?
Kyle
Goddammit! [leaves his seat]
Cartman
Have fun, dude.
The Principal's office. Kyle arrives and sighs heavily before going in. At the desk, Mr. Mackey is looking through some drawers, but PC Principal isn't there.
Mr. Mackey
[looks up surprised] Oh, Kyle. [sits down on the chair and looks fearful] Uhh, uhh, thank you for coming.
Kyle
Where's PC Principal?
Mr. Mackey
I think he's finally lost it, Kyle. He and his PC buddies are on a hunger strike and, they're calling for people's resignations. Kyle, PC Principal had problems with Jimmy and with Leslie. And now they're missing. M'kay? Nobody knows where they are. That's what happens. You go against PC, and you just end up missing. M'kay?
Kyle
What are you talking about?
Mr. Mackey
PC Principal had issues with them. M'kay? And he had issues with you, Kyle. Whatever's goin' on, it's pretty damn scary.
Montage. First, programming code appears onscreen, then Jimmy

For years, mankind has tried to rid the world of ads. For our ancestors, ads couldn't be avoided. But everyone knew what was an ad, and what wasn't. After many years, mankind invented cable. A way to p-pay for television so there would be no ads. But somehow, the ads still found a way. And so mankind invented TiVo. A way to skip past commercials. Finally, it appeared to be the end of ads. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads were stopped. Or so it seemed. With the rise of the Internet, suddenly the ads got an en- tirely new way to attack us. Popups. The top scientific minds were brought together to find a way to stop the ads, once and for all. They invented the ad blocker. Suddenly there were no ads on phones, on computers. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads adapted. They became s-smarter. They disguised themselves as news. All around the world people read news stories completely unaware that they were reading ads . And now, the ads have taken the next step in their evolution. They have taken human form. Ads are among us. They could be your friend, your g-gardener. The ads are trying to wipe us out. But the question is... how?
The Marsh house, dinner. All the family is there.
Randy
So, um, ahem, South Park kind of sucks now. You guys wanna bail? [everyone else but Grandpa are stunned at this and stop eating.]
Sharon
What?
Shelly
What are you talking about?
Randy
It's just, you know, it used to be nice and laid-back here, but now it's all [puts his palms forward] Uuuuhhh, you know? Like like now everybody's all Uuhh-uuhhh. Let's bail. You wanna bail, Stan?
Stan
No, I don't. [Randy lowers his head and looks at his food,]
The master bedroom, after dinner. Randy is pacing back and forth across the room while Sharon stands with her arms crossed looking at him
Sharon
What's going on, Randy?
Randy
Nothing! I just... You know, we don't have to live here, we can live anywhere.
Sharon
Last month, all you could talk about was how great this town had become. What changed your mind?
Randy
[stops and looks away] ...We can't afford it. [Sharon's jaw drops]
Sharon
We can't afford it?
Randy
All these fancy new restaurants and shops and [sits on the edge of the bed] everyone wants to live here! A bowl of City beef costs ten bucks now, for Christ's sake. And there's nowhere to shop but stupid Whole Foods!
Sharon
[crosses her arms] Well, we'll just have to stop going to those places.
Randy
I had to take out a second mortgage on the house.
Sharon
You [uncrosses her arms] what?
Randy
[gets up, runs to her, and holds her shoulders] I had to, Sharon! It isn't my fault! It's the Man. Don't you see? The Man... is pricing us out of our own town.
The newsmen's headquarters. Leslie is in the interrogation room, while Jimmy looks in from the meeting room.
Jimmy
[faces the newsmen] It's just my luck. I talk to a nice girl, seem to hit it off, and she turns out to just be an ad.
Tom
Well, that's what an ad does. She was designed to entice, and manipulate.
Jimmy
This is such a fantastic story for the school newspaper. Why don't we just run it so that everyone knows the truth?
Tom
Jimmy, we're newsmen, like you. For decades we used our soft buttery voices to inform the people about what's happening. Then we watched as our entire industry was taken over by the ads. [the newsman to his right lowers his head and looks at the table] Some of our colleagues were manipulated into doing the ads' bidding. The man who came to your house with a gun was one of them. Our own Kevin Jarvis has more.
Kevin
Thanks, Tom. Jimmy, the man who tried to kill you was Brian Boint, of WXNR, Fort Collins. When he saw there was no money in news anymore he sided with the ads, even though he knew it meant the destruction of our species. Back to you, Tom.
Tom
Thanks, Kevin. The only hope for the truth to get out there, Jimmy, is for you to see through this ad's deception and to find out what they're planning. Your Super School News was a threat to them. But unless you get this little bitch to talk, we may never know why.
South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Kenny and Stan walk into view, spot Kyle, and walk over to him. Stan is carrying a copy of the school newspaper
Stan
Dude, Kyle. Will you look at this? [shows him the paper, which has a report on PC Principal sending Jimmy and Leslie on a Disney Cruise]
Kyle
"Principal Sends Two Favorite Students On A Disney Cruise. This week, students Jimmy Valmer and Leslie Meyers are being treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation for their outstanding school-" what the hell is this?
Stan
It doesn't make any sense, dude. PC Principal is using the school paper to cover something up.
Kyle
Yeah I... Ah I don't wanna get involved.
Stan
You don't wanna get involved? Dude, what's wrong with you?
Kyle
I've already learned you can't win against PC Principal. You should know of all people since he converted your dad.
Stan
What's that supposed to mean?
Butters
[runs up with Cartman] Fellas! We found out what happened to Jimmy! He got to go on a vacation for being an exemplary student.
Stan
That is not what happened! Something is very wrong here! We all have to stand up to PC Principal together!
Cartman
Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?
The school newsroom. Nathan is at the computer typing random letters on the keyboard.
Nathan
I like the school paper. I like to type with my hands. [the camera then shows Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters in the room watching Nathan.]
Kyle
Who told you that the principal sent Jimmy on a Disney Cruise?
Nathan
Uhhh. Uhhh. Uhhh, I don't remember.
Stan
You have quotes in here from Jimmy. Did you talk to him?
Nathan
Uhhh. Uhhh, I like the school paper.
Stan
[the boys look at each other] Come on, we'll get to the bottom of this. [they head out]
Nathan
[some seconds later] Did I do good, computer? [touches the screen] I think the sponsored content fooled them. I hope I made you happy. Can you see me, computer? Do you know what I'm thinking right now? [a porn popup windows appears] Ahh, thanks, computer.
The edge of town. Caitlyn, Principal Victoria, and Mr. Garrison have arrived and park on the side of the road to look at the town.
Principal Victoria
We have to make sure nobody recognizes us. There's no telling who works for who. Here, Caitlyn, I got you this fake mustache to put on.
Caitlyn
I'm not putting on a mustache, I'll look silly.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, that, that's where you draw the line, huh Caitlyn?
Caitlyn
Don't be an asshole.
Mr. Garrison
No, you're right, that's nuts! A woman wearing a mustache, that's just ridiculous, huh Cait?
Caitlyn
Alright alright, I'll put it on, fuck.
Mr. Garrison
No no, please, Cait, don't put on a fake mustache, that's c-razy. [Caitlyn puts it on] You don't want people thinking you're a weirdo, I mean, Jeez.
Caitlyn
[taps him gently like a kitten] You-hur such an asshole.
ShiTpaTown, day. A shopper leaves Whole Foods with two bags of groceries and is promptly run over by Caitlyn. Nobody bats an eye. Garrison and Victoria step out, followed by Caitlyn
Mr. Garrison
What the hell is this? What have they done to my town?
Principal Victoria
Keep your voice down.
Mr. Garrison
Since when do we have a flippin' Whole Foods?! [they walk towards it]
Principal Victoria
Everything's changed.
Survey worker
[stops the three of them] Hi there, you got a minute for gay rights?
Mr. Garrison
Gay rights? Jeez, you've already got all those. What the hell do you wanna do now? [the three walk on in]
Whole Foods. The clerk at checkout 5 is finished with Mr. Stotch's purchases
Clerk
All right, your total is a hundred twenty six thirty nine, and would you like to give a dollar to help hungry children get iPads to protect your Internet safe space today?
Stephen
I will.
Mr. Garrison
What the Sam Hell is goin' on!
The interrogation room. Jimmy and Leslie face off again.
Leslie
Why would anyone think that I'm on the principal's side? I hate the principal. I think he's a dick.
Jimmy
So you don't know anything about the principal that might be newsworthy? Super School News worthy?
Leslie
Just that he hated me and called me a blabbermouth. I don't think I'm a blabbermouth. I just like talking to people.
Jimmy
[clears his throat] Leslie, what kind of... plans do you have? Do you have any... plans?
Leslie
What kind of plans?
Jimmy
Just, you know, plans. Like what are you hoping tooo... accomplish? [the newsmen watch from the meeting room]
Leslie
I don't know. What are your plans?
Jimmy
Well, I want to pursue careers in both news reporting and comedy.
Leslie
Really? That's... different.
Jimmy
Yeah, you're pretty different yourself, Leslie.
Leslie
How so?
The meeting room. Barbrady is still bearing witness while Jimmy sits at the table with the newsmen
Jimmy
I'm starting to think that maybe all ads aren't so bad.
Tom
Jimmy, you're thinking with your dick.
Jimmy
I am not thinking with my dick.
Tom
Yes you are.
Jimmy
No, I just think that she's a-
Tom
Put your dick away.
Jimmy
She's ag- emotional
Tom
Jim.
Jimmy
Interesting, caring girl.
Tom
Jimmy, that's your dick talking. [Jimmy stays quiet] Believe me, I know how you feel. Ads promise us things. Ads are perfect. But make no mistake: [speaks slowly] all ads lie. And all ads deceive.
Kyle's room, afternoon. Kyle is at his computer browsing the Web and looking at Twitter and Instagram.
Kyle
There. Leslie's Instagram and her Twitter. Last entry was ten days ago.
Butters
What about Jimmy's?
Kyle
Jimmy never used that stuff, remember? He said he hated using the Internet.
Cartman
How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
Butters
What are you doing now?
Kyle
I'm just looking for any news articles or anything about PC Principal. [his computer is recording the conversation] Where did you say PC Principal was from?
Stan
I think it was Vermont.
Kyle
Maybe there's something from the news in Vermont that could give us a clue about- [an ad for a Vermont vacation pops up] Goddammit what the hell is this?
Stan
That's an ad for skiing in Vermont.
Butters
Wow that looks fun! [Kyle closes the popup and tries again. A couple of windows later, he gets a news article]
Kyle
Dude. Dude, look at this. "How PC Culture is changing Vermont from a state of intolerance to a s-" [a popup ad for a guitar appears] Dude there it is again!
Kenny
What?
Kyle
It's that goddamned guitar! This ad is fucking following me!
Stan
Just click out of it.
Kyle
I'm trying! Goddammit get over here!
Stan
That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar.
Kyle
[looks at Stan] It is pretty cool dude, it tunes itself.
Cartman
How does it do that?
Kyle
It's this company that does all kinds of hi-tech instruments. See look, I'll show you.
Stan
Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can- [a popup ad for Victor Frankenstein appears] Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that.
Cartman
That movie's gonna suck dude.
Stan
Hit the arrow, I wanna see where it's playing.
Kyle
[click] OH. Sorry, wrong arrow button. [a popup ad for Fun Cream ice cream appears]
Butters
Wow, what kind of ice cream is that?
At an ice cream parlor, later on. They're in a booth laughing at something
Butters
So Clyde said to Token, "Why don't you open a bank account with your mouth so I can deposit my dick in it?" [the boys laugh]
Kyle
So then what'd Token say?
Butters
Well Token was all like-
Stan
Wait wait wait wait wait whoa, whoa. What the hell are we doing?
Cartman
Eating ice cream, dipshit.
Stan
But what about Jimmy? We were all like totally trying to find out what happened to him.
Kyle
Whoa, what the hell just happened?
Butters
We got distracted. We've gotta get back to that computer! [The boys split for the computer without their ice cream, except to Cartman, who takes his... and a couple of seconds later, Kenny's]
Skeeter's Wine Bar, day. Skeeter is serving up drinks
Skeeter
Now this here is a dry Riesling. You're gonna experience vanilla after-tones and a nutty finish.
Rancher
You mean like someone put their balls in the glass?
Skeeter
No, like chestnuts, dammit!
Rancher
I just can't keep up with this town no more. Everything's gettin' all nice and fancy. I swear I'm gonna need to get a second mortgage on the ranch just to pay muh daily expenses.
Randy
Don't you get it? That's just what they want. Nobody cares about the people who lived here before. They want us to move, 'cause they wanna knock our houses down and build more lofts and villas!
Skeeter
Alright Randy, you should probably lay off the old vine Châteauneuf-du-Pape.
Randy
[now by Stuart's table] You'll all see! Pretty soon everyone who used to live here is gonna have to move. And we'll be shopping at Safeway again. [sets his glass down on the table and walks out the door]
The sidewalk in front of Skeeter's. Randy walks down the street thinking to himself...
Randy (singing)
Where has my town gone? Where has- [a leg kicks him across the face]
Randy
Oooff!
Caitlyn
You like apples? [punches him in the belly, causing him to groan] How d'you like them apples? [hauls him into the alley]
Randy
Hey, it's Caitlyn Jenner! [Caitlyn slams Randy against a wall face first]
Garrison
Check his ass!
Randy
Principal Victoria? [Caitlyn pulls down Randy's pants and briefs to reveal the PC branding]
Victoria
He's one of them.
Randy
One of what?
Garrison
Caitlyn. [Caitlyn punches Randy hard in the ribs. He groans and collapses onto the ground.]
The meeting room. Jimmy and Leslie face off yet again.
Jimmy
Okay Leslie, let's try a different approach. Let's say you wanted tooo... destroy the entire species. How would you go about it?
Leslie
Why would I want to destroy an entire species? You have the wrong idea about me, Jimmy. The person trying to change things and make things terrible is the new principal.
Jimmy
And what is the new principal trying to do, Leslie?
Leslie
He's trying to make sure that people like you and me aren't allowed to exist. I know that you're trying to help. I know that the newsmen in there are trying to help too. [Kevin glances back at Tom] But now I'm going to tell you something very important, Jimmy. [the newsmen lean in towards the monitors. A popup car ad appears, and they can't see or hear what Leslie is saying.]
The meeting room
The Chevy Ad
[a driver walks up to his truck and plays with his dog] Like a rock. I drive a Chevy, I'm a cowboy, and I drive it like a rock.
Tom
What the hell is that?
Kevin
Tom, it looks like a popup ad.
Tom
How did an ad get in here? Let's go to David at the network hub.
David
No answers here, Tom. We're trying to correct the problem.
The interrogation room. The room is now bathed in red light, a sign that the room is secure and no one can see or hear what's going on inside from outside
Leslie
You have to get me out of here, Jimmy. They're going to kill me.
Jimmy
What?
Leslie
Listen to me carefully and don't look at the glass. I feel something for you I have never felt before. I think it's trust. The men in there are sick with hatred and as soon as they realize I have no information they are going to burn me. I've seen them do it to others. Please, you have to help me, Jimmy. Don't let them hurt me. Please don't abandon me. When the lights go back on just look at me and smile.
The meeting room
Tom
David, any word on the popup ad situation?
David
Tom, we've just about got it fixed. It should be ready now. [the newsmen turn to look at the monitors, and Leslie is down]
Leslie
And that's really it, Jimmy. I want to help all of you however I can. [he looks at her, and smiles a second later]
Foot Vault, a shoe store. The boys are getting fitted for new shoes and enjoying themselves. They had gone to McDonald's and ordered chicken McNugget's and sodas, which they are now consuming in the shoe store
Cartman
And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. [the boys burst out laughing again]
Stan
Wait wait wait wait whoa whoa. What the hell are we doing?
Butters
We're tryin' on shoes and eatin' chicken nuggets, stupid. What do you think?
Stan
No. That's not what we set out to do.
Kyle
We were... We were on Cartman's computer looking up news stories about PC Principal.
Cartman
Didn't we finish doing that?
Stan
No, we didn't.
Kyle
It's like... someone's trying to... distract us. [looks suspiciously at Stan] Because they're worried what we'll uncover about PC people.
Stan
Yeah, like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because they're afraid.
Kyle
Why are you looking at me?
Stan
Why are you looking at me?
Cartman
Why isn't anyone looking at me?
Park Motel, day. Caitlyn's car is parked over two people in front of Room 10. Caitlyn closes the blinds. Mr. Garrison splashes some water onto Randy
Randy
Hey, fuck you.
Garrison
Wake up, dickhead!
Randy
[opens his eyes] Garrison? The hell is wrong with you?!
Garrison
I'll tell you what's wrong with me! There's enemies to humanity out there wantin' to put an end to all of us, and there's assholes like you helpin' them out!
Randy
I don't know what you're talking about.
Victoria
Whose idea was it to revitalize the shitty part of town into an arts and foods district called ShiTpaTown?
Randy
Garrison
Son of a bitch!
Randy
What? To take one area of town that was rappy and gentrify it for the local people to enjoy? I thought we could keep it contained.
Victoria
It doesn't contain. What's happened to South Park is happening everywhere. [brings out a photo book and flips through some pictures] Thirty miles south of here in the town of Fairplay, they've changed the area north od Downtown into NoDoFoPa. A rundown area south of the capital in Cheyenne, Wyoming, is now historic SoCaCheyWo. Channel Street in mid-Chicago is being revitalized into Chimichanga.
Randy
Oh my God.
Victoria
LoDo, SoBro, RivMo, all happening at the same time. And it isn't just in the U.S. In Cairo, the area northwest of the third pyramid is NoWe3Pi. Three miles north of Auschwitz is NoMoAuchie. It goes on and on!
Randy
What does it mean?
Garrison
In our town it all started when PC Principal arrived. He's part of a mjuch larger conspiracy, and you're his lackey.
Randy
Not me. If PC Principal has been using us, I'll take the bastard down myself.
The PC Delta house, day. A reporter files this report
Reporter
It's day two of the hunger strike started by the college-aged fraternity brothers who are demanding that all of South Park's community leaders step down. The PC frat brothers say they've gone now two days without eating any pussy, and will continue to do so until people resign.
Tom
Who is that reporter? Do we... know him?
Kevin
Tom, that's Bill Keegan, WCFO.
Tom
Thanks, Brian. [Jimmy sneaks past the newsmen in the background] He's working for the ads, obviously. Sellout douche-bag.
Newsman
That's right, Tom. He was always a douche-bag at the conventions.
Tom
Thanks, Rick. Stay dry.
The interrogation room door opens. Leslie looks up. Jimmy peeks in
Jimmy
Leslie, come on.
Leslie
Jimmy. You're gonna help me?
Jimmy
Yeah I'm gonna help you. I mean, come on.
The meeting room. Jimmy and Leslie make it to the entrance, but the sound of his crutches draw the newsmen's attention
Tom
Jimmy! [Jimmy and Leslie turn around]
Newsman 2
Oh Jesus, he let her out.
Jimmy
PC Principal is our enemy, not her.
Tom
His dick is compromised. [spreads his arms out to protect the newsmen] Stay back! [the newsmen and Barbrady step back a few feet]
Jimmy
It is not my dick. I am thinking rationally and with logic. I am taking her out of here!
Tom
Well then, [pulls a gun out of his inside coat pocket and aims it at Jimmy] I'm sorry I'm going to have to do this, Jimmy. [walks over to Barbrady and gives him the gun] Officer Barbrady, we need you to shoot these kids.
Barbrady
What?
Tom
The ad has got to him. [puts Barbrady into a shooting stance] There's no time to argue.
Barbrady
I'm not shooting any more kids.
Tom
Do you want to save your town?!
Jimmy
Officer Barbrady, we have to stop PC Principal before it's too late.
Tom
Barbrady, shoot them in their heads!
Barbrady
No! I'm not shooting any more people! Not for you, not for nobody!
Tom
You're making the worst mistake of your life, officer.
Barbrady
Maybe so. All I know is I'm done shooting people! [his gun goes off and grazes Kevin on his left shoulder, causing it to bleed]
Kevin
Augh!
Barbrady
Oh sorry. Jeez. [Jimmy and Leslie exit first, then Barbrady follows and closes the door]
Tom
Dammit!
The school cafeteria, lunchtime
Stan
Think about it, you guys. From the moment that PC Principal took over Kyle has been different. Haven't you noticed?
Butters
Yeah.
Stan
He's distracting us, either because he's too afraid or because he- [Kyle arrives with his lunch and sits next to him. Butters is stunned that Kyle showed up]
Kyle
Well what are you guys talking about?
Butters
Nothin'.
Cartman
Stan's calling you a traitor.
Kyle
What?!
Stan
Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you don't want us investigating PC Principal.
Kyle
And why do you think that, Stan?!
Stan
I don't know.
Kyle
Because if anyone has a reason for us not mess with PC Principal, it's you! Let's not forget that Stan's dad is PC Principal's little bitch!
Butters
Wuh huh, that's a good point.
Cartman
I am loving this right now.
Stan
My dad's stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle!
Kyle
It is you, isn't it?! That's why you're trying to shift the blame on me. That's very Cartman of you, Stan!
Cartman
Hoh that's low. [smiles]
Stan
Don't you dare call me a Cartman!
Kyle
N-ho, that's good! Just keep on distracting everybody! It seems to be working, Cartman!
Stan
Fuck you, Kyle! [delivers a left hook and Kyle falls off the lunch bench]
Cartman
Fight! [the kids gather round to watch. Half of them are cheering them on, the other half stay quiet. Nathan stops by to see what's going on.]
The PC Delta house, night. A lone jogger runs by it, only to be mowed down by Caitlyn and her passengers, who all get out of the car and walk towards the house
Garrison
Time to take this asshole down!
Randy
[gets in front of the group] Whoa whoa whoa, guys, whoa! We can't just go walking in there.
Garrison
Why not?
Randy
This is a safe space. We're not allowed past this. When you breach a college safe space, you're crossing the most sacred human boundary there is.
Caitlyn
J'hoh, give me a break.
Randy
Nonononono, look, this is very real, and very important in PC culture. Every human has a right to a safe space and it cannot be entered.
Garrison
[determined] I can. Watch. [lifts up the PC tape and walks under and on to the house]
Randy
Wow, how did you-? [Principal Victoria and Caitlyn Jenner do the same] Whoa.
The school newsroom, day. Nathan is at the computer typing away very slowly. The camera moves enough to reveal Jimmy and Leslie at the door
Jimmy
Burning the midnight oil, huh Nathan?
Nathan
Jimmy.
Jimmy
You sonofabitch. What have you done to the Super School News?
Nathan
I was just holding down the fort while you were away, Jim.
Jimmy
Writing headlines sponsored by PC Principal and the ads? How much did they pay you?!
Nathan
Please, Jimmy, I'm just trying to survive here.
Jimmy
Everyone's gonna know the truth, Nathan. We're getting a new edition of the school paper out by morning. Everyone's gonna know all about the ads. [Leslie punches him and he goes flying into a bookcase. She walks over and punches him five more times, then turns around and walks off to close the door. She returns and throws him up in the air. He hits the ceiling and falls to the floor. Leslie walks past Nathan, who laughs at Jimmy's misfortune]
Leslie
Deal with him. [gets on the computer and starts searching]
Jimmy
Leslie... I thought we were b-b-b-besties.
Nathan
Hey there, big man. Editor of the school paper, huh? You still don't even know half the story.
PC Delta, later. Caitlyn is moving around like a detective through the lobby
Caitlyn
It's clear.
Garrison
Where is everybody? I thought the news said they're on a hunger strike.
Randy
It doesn't make sense. Someone's always here.
Victoria
Take a look at this! [the other three adults walk over to see what she's seeing - the same State Farm ad of PC Principal and Leslie as before]
Garrison
What the hell?
Victoria
It looks like he was researching this. You see this news story?
Garrison
If this is true, then... PC Principal's trying to help.
Randy
Click on that. What is that?
Garrison
No, click out of that. What is this?
Foot Vault. Caitlyn, Randy, Principal Victoria, and Mr. Garrison are trying on new shoes, like Stan and friends did before, and enjoying themselves
Garrison
So, so then, so then Caitlyn says "Look bitch, you're married to Bill Clinton. If anyone should be afraid of AIDS, it's you."
Caitlyn
That stupid bitch had it coming. [they all laugh]
Garrison
Oh God, I love you, Cait. We're so gong to win the primaries. [they all laugh]
Randy
Whoa, whoawhoawhoa wait wait wait. What, what were we doing again?
Kyle's house, evening. The doorbell rings and Kyle goes to answer it. Leslie is outside, shivering
Kyle
Leslie.
Leslie
You're trying to find out what's going on, right? But your friend is standing in your way?
Kyle
How do you know thi-?
Leslie
I can show you what's going on, Kyle. But you have to trust me. [holds out her hand] What's the last four digits of your Sosh?
Kyle
2692 [They shake hands, and he leaves the house with her]
End of Truth and Advertising

PC Principal Final Justice
The outskirts of Moscow, day. A silhouetted figure is walking away from the city, tightly wrapped to protect against the icy wind and snow. He's dressed for a winter hike. He finds a bar and opens the door, and a bunch of angry Russian faces look back at him. The bar is dimly lit. The figure goes inside and closes the door. He loosens his scarf and lowers his hood. It's PC Principal.
PC Principal
Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others.
Russian 1
[balding, with facial stubble] Is it him?
Russian 2
[with mustache] Yes, it's him. PC Principal.
PC Principal
[walks up to the bar and puts his pickaxe aside, and drinks the glass of water waiting for him] You know, if there's one thing that makes me sick, it's when a race thinks they're superior and don't know how to check their privilege. [a Russian walks up to him and lays a hand on his shoulder. PC Principal responds with a right hook. A second Russian attacks, and PC Principal responds with a knee to the chest and slams him onto a table, which shatters under him. PC Principal then stands over him and stomps on his face, shattering his head to pieces. A third Russian lunges at him with a knife, but he kicks that Russian in the face, then delivers a head butt and snaps his neck in half. The remaining Russians back away. A fourth Russian attacks him, but he breaks that Russian's arm and punches him away. A fifth one attacks, and he punches him away. A sixth one attacks with a cue stick, but PC Principal snaps the stick in two and jabs the thick end into the Russian's right eye. A seventh one takes a shot at him, but he takes the gun and jabs the ax into the Russian's head. An eighth Russian walks up to him, but throws his hands up when PC Principal aims the gun at him.]
Russian 3
I'm not one of them! I'm not one of them!
PC Principal
An African-American flips a turtle over on its back. A transgender Filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun. What color is the Filipino's father? [The Russian doesn't know how to answer] I didn't think you were human. [the Russian lunges at him, but he fires off four shots through the Russian's head and kicks him in the face. He then notices his axe and pulls it out of the seventh Russian's head. He turns around and walks out of the bar.]
South Park Elementary, day. The kids mill around in the hallway. Bebe goes to her open locker, Wendy walks her way, Craig and Tweek walk by holding hands.
Butters
[still in his halo, talking to Charlotte on his iPhone] Yeah, everybody's pretty freaked out over here, baby. Everyone is on edge and feelin' really nervous.
Charlotte
That sounds terrible. Be careful, Butters.
Butters
I will, honey.
Kyle
Butters. [Butters' smile vanishes] Get to the bathroom. Now. [Butters is a bit alarmed]
The boys' restroom, later. Kyle is inside and locks the door. He turns to see the other four boys - Stan, Cartman, Butters, and Kenny
Stan
Alright Kyle, what's this about?
Kyle
Jimmy's dead.
Cartman
What?
Kyle
I know the whole story. PC Principal killed him, and tried to kill Leslie, but she got away.
Kenny
(Are you fuckin' serious, dude?)
Kyle
PC Principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesn't follow their PC ideology.
Stan
How do you know all this?
Kyle
Because Leslie's with me. I'm keeping her safe.
Butters
Heh, [sing-song] Kyle's got a girlfriend?
Kyle
It gets worse. Someone in this town helped these people come here. That person faked the Bill Cosby joke to get Principal Victoria fired.
Cartman
Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?
Kyle
I think it's obvious. Stan's dad.
Stan
Kyle!
Kyle
Stan, your dad is one of them. He had to be the one to let them in.
Stan
[gets in his face] You're letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you! [walks past him, opens the doors, and walks out]
Kyle
There's no way to know who we can trust.
Cartman
So what do we do now?
Kyle
There's only one thing we can do. [turns around] We have to get guns.
Butters
Guns?
Kyle
It's the only way for us to be safe.
Cartman
Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?
The neighborhood park, day. The boys are on the basketball court checking out their new guns.
Cartman
Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?
Kenny
(Now we need to steal a car and escape.)
Butters
I already feel a lot safer.
Kyle
You guys lay low and watch your backs. I'm gonna go keep Leslie protected.
Cartman
Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner. [Kyle smiles and walks off. Cartman poses with his gun] Do I look sweet, Butters?
Butters
[giggles] Yeah.
The Marsh house, dinner. The whole family is present, eating chicken, mashed potatoes, carrots, and garlic bread. Stan looks up at Randy, then gets angry. Randy notices and looks back, then gets in his face
Randy
What?
Stan
What?
Sharon
Can you pass the garlic bread, Randy?
Randy
Why wouldn't I be able to pass the garlic bread? [picks up the bowl and offers it to her. She takes some bread from it, and he sets it back where it was.]
Stan
Dad, where were you last night?
Randy
What, wait. Where was I what? Out, with friends, doing things. [wipes his face clean] Well I'm full. I'm gonna go work in the garage for a little bit. [leaves the table]
Stan
Work on what?
Randy
On stuff to do, things. [reaches back and takes some more food.] Um, oh I'm gonna take some of this with me. I'm still hungry.
Sharon
I thought you just said you were full.
Randy
Jee-sus! What? Am I on trial or something? God-damn! [takes the bowl of garlic bread] You guys are really acting strange. [his mouth remains a bit open as he walks away keeping an eye on the family]
The garage, moments later. Randy enters it and closes the door behind him. Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria, and Caitlyn Jenner wait for him at the workbench.
Randy
Alright, we're good. Nobody suspects a thing. [sets the food on the bench, next to a laptop they're looking at]
Mr. Garrison
Take a look at this.
Principal Victoria
We've got everything from PC Principal's hard drive. He was on to the gentrification around the world, and he was convinced that whatever was responsible... wasn't... human.
Randy
Not human? Then what?
Mr. Garrison
I don't care if they're aliens or vampires, we need to round them up fast and fuck them till they're dead.
Caitlyn
You don't wanna fuck a vampire, you'll get hepatitis.
Mr. Garrison
Oh girlfriend, I'm well beyond that. [Caitlyn giggles]
Randy
Oh my God. Don't you see what this means? If something not human is gentrifying the entire world, soon no human will be ale to afford it. They're trying to price our species out of existence.
ShiTpaTown, day. There are lofts there now, just as in SoDoSoPa, and the camera zooms in on one in particular... Nathan and Jimmy are seated around a coffee table in the loft
Nathan
Well? How do you like my new apartment?
Jimmy
What happened to you, Nathan? I always thought you were a nice kid. Now you've got a gun?
Nathan
Huh. Everyone's gettin' one of these now, Jim. Nobody knows whom to trust.
Jimmy
Yeah? Well guns are never the answer.
Nathan
Don't you kinda wish you'd had one back when Leslie betrayed you and nearly beat you to death?
Jimmy
Oh. I guess it would have been a decent answer then. Tou-t-t-t.. touché.
Nathan
You see, I've got expensive tastes, Jimmy. I like good food. [leaves his chair and walks around] Organic pressed juices. And I've got a thing for high-class prostitutes. [stands next to a black woman who's buffing her nails with an emery board.] Have you been introduced to my current girlfriend?
Classi
My name is Classi, with an I, and a little dick hanging off the C that bends around and fucks the L out of the A S S.
Jimmy
Nice to meet you, Classi.
Nathan
All I had to do was work for the ads and I got everything I wanted. My own loft, with all of ShiTpaTown right at my doorstep. All it took was some PC and the whole thing was set in motion.
Jimmy
Oh great. So now ads are using PC for their own gain? That's a new low.
Nathan
What is PC but a verbal form of gentrification? Spruce everything up, get rid of all the ugliness in order to create a false sense of paradise. Only one thing can actually live in that world. Ads.
Jimmy
I know I've said it before, but man, do I hate ads.
Cartman's house, night. He's in the living room watching a movie and eating chips on the sofa. The lights come on and Liane appears at the foot of the stairs
Liane
Eric Cartman, I told you to get ready for bed!
Cartman
Yeah, I just want finish this movie.
Liane
No, Eric! This is a school night!
Cartman
Mom, I'm into this movie. I'm not going to bed right now. Chillax.
Liane
You most certainly are! Right now, mister!
Cartman
I will go to bed [stands up and aims his gun at her] when this movie is over, Mom!
Liane
Eric, where did you get that?
Cartman
Turn off the light and go back to bed. I'm staying up.
Liane
Eric, you march right up to your room, and you-
Cartman
I don't think so, Mom.
Liane
Eric, you get your butt to bed!
Cartman
No means no, Bill Cosby!
Liane
[draws a gun on him] I told you to go upstairs right now!
Cartman
Whoa, Mom, what the hell?
Liane
I'm not going to tell you again, Eric! It is time... for night-night!
Cartman
Mom, put down the gun.
Liane
[advances on him] I am your mother, and you will do what I tell you!
Cartman
Okay, I am going. [walks around her, keeping his gun trained on her.]
Liane
Well then, you go right now, Mister! [keeps her gun trained on him]
Cartman
I'm going to bed now, Mom. Chillax. [begins to go up the stairs backward.]
Liane
Alright then. No comic books, just straight to sleep! I love you, sweetie.
Cartman
Okay, I love you too, Mom. Night-night. [the sound of a door closing is heard]
Liane
[caresses her pistol] Wow, he... he listened. [puts it into her robe pocket and walks towards the kitchen]
Randy's garage. day. He's in there with Victoria, Garrison, and Caitlyn
Randy
There has to be something. Some clue as to what we're dealing with.
Principal Victoria
The news stories PC Principal researched are all so contradictory, as if whatever these things are have control over the news somehow.
Randy
That sounds like vampires to me.
Principal Victoria
We have to find out who had me fired with the Cosby joke. It's the key to knowing what we're dealing with.
Stan
Principal Victoria? [the adults take notice] Mr. Garrison? Caitlyn Jenner?
Randy
Stan, what the hell are you doing in here?
Stan
Tell me what's going on, Dad?
Randy
Nothing. We're just hanging out, talking about Coldplay, alright?
Stan
[pulls out his gun and aims it at the adults. The adults hold their hands up] No! I wanna know what the hell is going on right now!
Randy
What are you doing with that?
Stan
Kyle said I couldn't trust you! What are you planning, Dad?
Randy
Stan, it isn't what you think.
Stan
Then what is it?!
Randy
Look, I need to show you something, okay? You need to see this, son. [slowly reaches into his back pocket as Stan watches intensely, whips out his gun and aims it at Stan] Ohh! Psych! Now put the fucking gun down, bitch!
Stan
I'm gonna go tell Mom!
Randy
Oh yeah? You go tell her! I'll tell her you had a gun! You'll be in more trouble than me! [Stan looks to the door, then at Randy] Stan! I am your dad. Put the gun down and sit over there.
Stan
[runs out of the garage] Mom!
Randy
Shit! [runs after him]
An aircraft carrier at sea. A helicopter drops down onto it and three sailors arrive to greet it. Other sailors stand nearby. The helicopter door opens and PC Principal, in handcuffs, is escorted out by two soldiers.
Weathers
Took a lot to hunt you down, PC Principal. You mind tellin' me why you're goin' around the world shootin' up revitalized arts and foods districts?
PC Principal
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Weathers
Try me!
PC Principal
[faces him] I don't know what they are, but they used me and others like me to try and change this planet.
Weathers
You don't know what "who" are?
Johnson
Sir! The President is on the phone. He wants to talk to you about PC Principal. [PC Principal looks at him as Weathers gets the phone]
Weathers
Yes, Mr. President? I see, sir. Yes, I understand. [lowers the phone and relays the President's orders] We're to release him immediately, no questions asked. And we're not supposed to believe anything he tells us. [the helicopter soldiers come and take the cuffs off him]
PC Principal
Huh, ain't that a peach?
Weathers
He's being set free now, Mr. President. Can I tell the commander why?
Leslie
[in President Obama's voice] This is a matter of national security. [the camera pulls back to show that she's at the Park Motel]
Weathers
I understand, sir.
Leslie
Thank you. God bless you.
Weathers
God bless you too, sir.
Leslie
May God bless the United States of America. [hangs up and puts her phone away, then leaves the bathroom. Kyle is waiting outside]
Kyle
Are you okay?
Leslie
Yeah, just feeling butterflies. And my hands are freezing!
Kyle
Here. [holds her hands to warm them up]
Leslie
Thank you, Kyle. [smiles]
Kyle
Don't worry, Leslie. I won't let anything happen to you. [smiles back and blinks]
The Marsh house. day. He has his gun drawn. Behind him are the living room, Victoria, Garrison, and Caitlyn.
Randy
I'm warning you: you're on the wrong side of this! We're just trying to get answers!
Sharon
[has a gun drawn on Randy] You pulled a gun on our son, Randy!
Randy
He pulled one on me first, Sharon!
Stan
Because you wouldn't talk to me, Dad!
Randy
[aims his gun at Stan] Stanley, let your mother and I deal with this!
Sharon
I told you to leave him alone!
Shelly
God I hate this family! [pulls out her own gun and aims it at Sharon] Why are you always taking Stan's side?!
Randy
[shifts his aim from Stan to Shelly] Whoa! Whoa, Shelly! Put down the gun, Shelly!
Shelly
You're always acting like Stan can't do anything wrong!
Stan
[shifts his aim from Randy to Shelly] She doesn't always take my side!
Shelly
[turns and aims at Stan] You shut up or I swear to God I'll use this!
Randy
Shelly, put it down, now!
Shelly
[shifts her aim to Randy] You don't even try to know me, Dad!
Randy
I want to, Shelly! I just sometimes feel like you hate me!
Sharon
I feel like you hate me, Randy!
Randy
[shifts his aim from Shelly to Sharon] I don't hate you, I love you! I need to be a better husband, [aims at Stan, who aims back] a better father! [shifts his aim to Shelly]
Stan
We all need to be better to each other! [Shelly shifts her aim to Stan, then to Randy, and then to Sharon]
Shelly
Okay, maybe I need to stop being so angry!
Randy
[lowers his gun] I love you guys. [Sharon lowers her gun]
Stan
[lowers his gun] We love you too, Dad. [Shelly lowers hers] We just wanna know what's going on with you.
Randy
Alright. I'll tell you everything. [caresses his gun] Wow, these things are amazing. [all the while Grandpa Marvin just ate. He didn't pull out a gun, and none was pulled on him.]
Jimbo's Guns, day. He's getting a lot of customers. Thomas and Laura Tucker enter. Inside are the Stotch, the Stevens, the Testaburger, and the Rodriguez parents. Clyde is there with his dad. Jimbo is behind the main counter, Ned is behind a side counter. An elderly woman approaches Jimbo
Jimbo
Alright, Mrs. Farnicle, enjoy, and remember: if the safety's on, you're good as gone. [Mrs. Farnicle leaves with her purchase] Okay, and next customer, please. [Officer Barrady, in civilian clothes, steps up with his purchase] Hah, going for the big one, huh? You must be feeling extra jumpy.
Officer Barbrady
You don't know the half of it.
Jimbo
[prepares the shotgun for him] Well, this thing should make you feel more at ease. You know, you ought-ta check out the gun show.
Officer Barbrady
The gun show?
Jimbo
[pulls up a sign and shows it to him] Yeah, it's gonna have everything! And with guns bein' so popular, practically everyone in town is gonna be in attendance!
Officer Barbrady
The entire town in one location? [this spooks him] Oh my God!
A Park Motel bathroom. Leslie is inside on the phone
Leslie
The principal has become our biggest problem. We need a news headline that will draw him back to town.
Nathan
[in his loft, away from Jimmy] Oh, you're gonna sponsor my content some more, baby? I'm all ears.
The Lofts at ShiTpaTown. While Nathan talks to Leslie on the phone, Jimmy chats up Classi
Jimmy
I've got to get to the Super School News. Hey, Classi, you think you can get me my crutches?
Classi
Mah, I don't think Nathan would like that.
Jimmy
You seem like a reasonable person. Do you really wanna live in a world controlled by ads? I mean, come on, Classi.
Classi
No. It's C-Lasssi, with an I. The little dick that hangs off the C fucks the L out of the ASS. CL-ASSSI.
Jimmy
Sorry, my bad. Look, I'm a news reporter, Claaassi, and in a world where ads control the news, there's no way to be sure anyone is ever hearing the truth.
Classi
Truth about what?
A Park Motel room. The blinds are drawn and Kyle peeks through the slats
Leslie
We can't just hide, Kyle. We have to let people know PC is the enemy before it's too late.
Kyle
Leslie, we don't know who is on their side. We have to stay safe.
Leslie
The principal is going to try and make up some crazy story. That's what PC people do. You have to get in front of everyone and tell them what you've learned.
Kyle
I... [turns aside and walks off] gave up giving speeches.
Leslie
But why? I came to you because I had heard how good you were at getting messages across. That and because... [smiles] I thought you were cute.
Kyle
I'm sure I'd have no problem giving a speech if you could be by my side.
Leslie
Well... I can't go with you, you know. It's too dangerous.
Kyle
Not if we go somewhere that's completely safe from any violence.
Leslie
Where?
Kyle
The gun show.
Leslie
Gun show?
Kyle
There'll be so many guns that nothing bad can happen.
The Marsh house. Randy has brought the laptop to the table. Victoria, Garrison, and Caitlyn join him around the dining room table as Shelly and Grandpa eat, and all their guns are on the table
Sharon
Someone purposely had Principal Victoria replaced with a new principal?
Randy
Yes. They wanted to use his PC as a means to start gentrification in our town.
Mr. Garrison
That'w why we thought PC Principal was behind it. But now we know they were just using his PC abilities to service their own needs.
Randy
When the pussy-crusher story came out in Super School News, it started to make PC Principal question himself. He started digging for answers. They didn't like that, so they tried to distract and mislead him. With this. [the distractions begin] Sorry, that's an ad for McDonald's, hold on. With... this. Oh. N, oh, there's that ad again. God these things are annoying. Anyways, whatever these beings are, they try to keep anyone from knowing the truth from [another pop-up ad] Ugh, I don't wanna see a slideshow. PC Principal said something was trying to divert and distract his subconscious mind with this. [The US-Thailand article comes up, with the accompanying State Farm ad. Stan gets a good look at it]
Stan
Wait... That's Leslie. [walks away from the table] Oh my God... It's Kyle.
Mr. Garrison
Kyle?
Stan
Kyle has been protecting Leslie. They're together. He's been making everyone feel paranoid and saying you're the enemy, Dad.
Randy
[rises from his chair] Well then, it's time to go ask Kyle why he sold out his own kind.
Principal Victoria
How will we get him to talk?
Randy
We're going to kill him with kindness. But instead of kindness we're going to use guns.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah!
Stan
Yeah!
Randy
Come on, let's go! [everyone grabs a gun and heads out the front door. Randy looks at Shelly] Shelly, you take care of Grandpa!
Shelly
Oooo-kay! [aims her gun at Marvin's head and Randy realizes what she's doing]
Randy
Nonono, don't shoot Grandpa, just literally take care of him. [follows the others outside and hops into Caitlin's car with them.]
Caitlyn Jenner
Buckle up, buckaroos! [starts the car, backs out of the driveway, and runs over an elderly woman and her dog. The dog is unscathed, but the woman is dead and mangled up]
The Lofts at ShiTpaTown. Nathan walks up to Jimmy and hands him a copy of the school paper for tomorrow
Nathan
Here it is, Jimmy. Hot off the presses.
Jimmy
What is that?
Nathan
The newest edition of Super School News, hitting the streets tomorrow.
Jimmy
Tragedy at gun show? What happened at the gun show?
Nathan
Not what happened, what's going to happen. The final sweeping underneath the rug. By this time tomorrow nobody will be asking questions ever again. The ads will have won. And I will be... The man.
Classi
I think the ads are playin' yo' ass.
Nathan
[slaps her across the face] Shut up Classiii!
Classi
Oh heeelllllll no!
Nathan
What?
Classi
Oh hell no! Yo' Down's Symdrome ass just slapped me! I'mo break your dick off! [picks him up and slams him into the glass wall that doubles as a window]
Nathan
Hang on, Classi, I'm sorry.
Classi
[punches him] I will bust yo' fuckin' ass! [punches him] I will bust yo' fuckin' nose. I ain't no Mimsy, asshole! [punches him] I'm a classy bitch! [punches him] And I do not! [punches him] Want ads! [punches him] Controllin' my news! [punches him. He groans as she lets him drop to the floor and walks away. She brings Jimmy's crutches to Jimmy]
Jimmy
Classi! Thank you.
Classi
You need my help? You got it!
Jimmy
I need your phone to call Officer Barbrady. And we have to get to that gun show, fast!
Classi
Quick! To the Classi mobile! [they leave the loft and hop into her car, and finally drive away]
The South Park Gun Show. The show's sign and trophy are shown onscreen.
Announcer
Welcome back to the South Park Gun Show. We've had over 2000 gorgeous guns come through this arena today. It's been whittled down to seven, the winners from each group. David, take us down theh line. [the seven are: Stephen Stotch, Fr. Maxi, Mayor McDaniels, Jimbo Kern, Linda Black, Ryan Valmer, and Richard Adler]
David
First we have the beautiful Yorkshire 33mm with proud owner Stephen Stotch.
Announcer
An absolutely gorgeous gun, David.
David
The playful and lovely Australian semiautomatic owned by Father Maxi.
Announcer
And there's the Mayor with her delightful Rhodesian ridgeback shotgun-rifle mix.
David
That's a favorite of the crow here. Always a favorite at these shows.
Cartman
That's a nice gun right there.
David
The judge now asking to see that Yorkshire 33mm up close.
Announcer
And there it is, just a beautiful gun in motion. Everybody loves it. [Stephen starts to prance aroundn with it, then returns to his mark. The crowd applauds its approval.] Looks like the judge wants to take another look at that shotgun-rifle mix. [The Mayor takes out a clicker and prances around with her shotgun-rifle mix. She returns to her mark and Jimbo takes his turn]
David
And next up will be the-
Randy
Nobody move! [enters the arena with Garrison, Victoria, Caitlyn, Sharon, and Stan]
Mr. Garrison
Everyone just stay where you are!
Announcer
And it looks like the gun show is under attack, David. [everyone in attendance gets their guns and arms them.]
David
Yes, six armed gunmen have entered the arena, one of which is carrying an absolutely gorgeous little Pekingese Glock 17.
Randy
Listen to me, everyone! There are beings who are purposely gentrifying the Earth so that humans can no longer afford it! We've been looking for Kyle Broflovski! Somebody's hiding him! [the spectators begin pointing guns at each other]
Kyle
[enters the arena at the far end with Leslie] Don't listen to them! The real conspiracy here are the PC extremists who have no problem killing whoever doesn't think like they do! [faces Stan] You son of a bitch Stan! How could you have sided with the enemy?!
Stan
Fuck you, Kyle! You're the enemy!
Jimmy
[enters the arena at the near end] You both got it wrong. [he's with Classi and Barbrady]
Kyle
Jimmy?
Mr. Garrison
Officer Barbrady?
Randy
Classi?
Sharon
[aims her gun at Randy] Randy??
Jimmy
Kyle, I know you probably thought Leslie was a kind, caring girl. But the truth is she's just an ad.
Randy
An ad?
Officer Barbrady
They've become sentient, They've taken human form. You can't tell what's human and what's an ad anymore.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, Jeez, are you serious?! How am I supposed to fuck an ad to death?!
Randy
Woah, flippin' ads! They're such a pain in the ass!
Kyle
You told me Jimmy was dead.
Stan
So now we know who got Principal Victoria fired!
Mr. Mackey
[looks around, then jumps out of his seat] Nobody move! Okay?! Everyone just stay where you are!
Randy
Mackey?
Mr. Mackey
Yes, I wanted Principal Victoria fired! But I didn't want any of this!
Principal Victoria
You got me fired?! Why?!
Mr. Mackey
Eighteen years of answerin' to you! EIGHTEEN YEARS! Of you always... tellin' me what to do!
Principal Victoria
If you had problems with me, why didn't you just talk to me?
Mr. Mackey
You never listen!! Nobody listens to me! They just expect me to listen to them!
Gerald
Maybe we should have realized that sometimes the counselor needs counseling.
Mr. Mackey
I don't know, maybe I got manipulated by these ads too somehow but, I should have been a better person!
Randy
We all could be better people! All of us! We all played a part!
Stephen
Maybe from now on people in this town need to communicate more! Care about each other!
Mr. Garrison
If we're gonna defeat our enemies, that's what it's gonna take! All of us, together! [with all the speeches done, they lower their weapons]
Randy
If only we'd had these before, huh?
Leslie
[now isolated] Every time you block us, we get smarter. Every time you try to stop us, we are more. If one plan fails, we will plan another. You will never be rid of ads!
PC Principal
HEY LESLIE! [she look to her left] Your species took PC and twisted it for evil purposes. [he runs towards her and drops the mic] THAT PISSES ME OFF! [he reaches her and delivers a right hook, then a left one, then does this again. He picks her up like a rag doll and holds her by the neck] You're expelled. [he delivers a final blow that goes clear through her head, but instead of blood, a day-glow blue liquid oozes out of it]
Cartman
Yes, dude!
Randy
Well, I guess there's just one last thing to take care of.
ShiTpaTown, day. The town has gathered in front of Whole Foods.
Randy
Why did it have to be like this?! Why couldn't we try to live on this planet together?! Maybe we're not perfect beings, but we built a better town. We didn't need you to do that! And we'll keep on trying to make it better!
Sharon
Randy, you're yelling at a Whole Foods.
Randy
Go on, get outta here! We know! Others will know! [holds up the latest edition of the Super School News, which has Leslie on the front page under the headline "YOUR FRIEND MIGHT BE AN AD"] It isn't going to be so easy! Not anymore! [the ground begins to rumble underfoot and the sidewalk begins to crack open. The Whole Foods lifts off like a flying saucer, turns around, and flies away]
A flag blows on a pole, presumably outside of the school.
PC Principal
Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of all the hate speech and micro-aggressions against our species. [a series of popup ads floats by] We have a new enemy out there. An almost invisible foe that is so bigoted, so racially biased they actually think we should all die. [a boy is shown at his computer at home, watching as ads fill his monitor] They are trying to attract our youth using tactics that are underhanded and unfair. [PC Principal is shown holding a school assembly as he had in earlier episodes] But no matter how hard they hit us, we cannot let them take from us our PC. And so I have been asked to stay on as your principal. A lot of changes will happen in the coming months. [Caitlyn puts a Garrison/Jenner pin on Mr. Garrison's lapel and straightens his tie. Then they bump fists and Garrison goes onstage] The bottom line is that the only thing that distinguishes those who want to kill us from those who don't is that we have the burning desire for social justice. We are at war, but the only way to win this war is to be as understanding, non-biased, and politically correct as possible.
Stan
This is going to be really hard.
End of PC Principal Final Justice

Member Berries
South Park Elementary Gymnasium. The girl's volleyball team are warming up.
Jim
Hello everyone and welcome back. We are live at South Park Elementary School where the local girl's volleyball team is about to take on the Jefferson Sabers.
Mike
And, hey Jim, it is packed. Sellout crowds tonight, first time in team history. Everyone turning out to see what's going to happen.
Jim
[Camera switches to Nichole, who is stretching] That's right, Mike. All eyes are of course on fourth grader Nichole Daniels. Will she sit or stand for the National Anthem? [The crowd stare at her.]
Mike
This week with athletes all over the country sitting down for the National Anthem, [Two people are seen holding a banner reading 'WE SUPPORT YOU NICHOLE!'] the question on everyone's mind is "What is this little girl gonna do?"
Jimbo
She's not gonna sit down. Why would she?
Randy
Screw that. I've got 100 bucks riding on this. Come on, Nichole. Sit on it!
Sports Commentator
Now please rise for the National Anthem. [they stand up.]
Randy
This is it.
Mike
The National Anthem starts. Nichole Daniels seems to be waiting. So far no si... Oh! [The camera moves to Heidi Turner, who is sitting down.] And Heidi Turner is sitting down!
Crowd
Ooh!
Jim
Might be totally unexpected. All eyes were on Nichole when Heidi Turner comes out of nowhere and sits down.
Mike
[Interrupting] And there goes Meghan Ridley! The crowd is going wild. What a turn of events! Let's check in with Dave.
Dave
And Mike, I've just looked at the girl's Twitter accounts and it appears they are sitting out the National Anthem to protest the harassment and trolling they receive on the Internet.
Mike
Complete surprise, Dave. Nobody saw this coming. Three girls now sitting down and finally, there goes Nichole.
Randy
Wow, Yeah, 100 bucks!
Jim
And, as the anthem draws to a close, this thing is over.
Mike
The final result, four athletes sitting out of the National Anthem, three of them not even black. A shocker here in South Park, thanks for joining us. [People start leaving]
Stephen
Oh my god, that was great. [The crowds empty out, leaving only a few left.]
Referee
Ah, play ball. [Blows whistle. The girls start playing.]
PC Principal's office. He's addressing the girls
PC Principal
Alright, ladies. First of all I wanna say that I completely respect your decision to protest our national anthem. Thought it was sweet. I believe you shed some light on some very important issues regarding gender equality.
Heidi
What are you doing about Eric Cartman?!
PC Principal
Ladies, I understand you're upset about the trolling you've received on the Internet, but there is no evidence that Eric Cartman is Skankhunt42.
Wendy
It is him, it's completely obvious, and nobody is doing anything about it!
PC Principal
Well he claims that he's been working at changing himself and the world around him. [presses the intercom button] Send in Mr. Cartman.
Cartman
[opens the door and enters] You wanted to see me, PC Principal?
PC Principal
Mr. Cartman, I'm gonna ask you one more time, are you or are you not the Internet troll Skankhunt42?
Cartman
It's "Skankhunt42" and no I am not.
Heidi
He's lying. Make him show you his phone.
Cartman
Unfortunately, that'd be a breach of my civil rights, but I can assure you, nobody respected you girls' poignant protest more than I did.
The U.S. Senate, day.
Joe Biden
Fellow Senators, our nation is divided like never before. While people everywhere fight for their voices to be heard, perhaps it is time for us to consider that our national anthem needs to be changed. Americans need an anthem that inspires and excites, an anthem that has something for everyone while still paying tribute to what it once was. I believe there's only one person capable of achieving this. [clicks on a handheld button and the picture behind him changes] J.J. Abrams.
Senators
[murmuring among themselves] J.J. Abrams!
Joe Biden
He saved Star Wars, and now we will ask him to save our country.
Three helicopters take to the sky and fly out of sight
J.J. Abrams' mansion. The helicopters touch down by the front gates and the senators pour out
Lady Senator
[over a megaphone] Mr. Abrams? Mr. Abrams, we need to speak with you.
Male Senator
Look, there. [a light comes on at the left end of the second floor, and a shadow stops by the window]
Lady Senator
[over the megaphone] Mr. Abrams I speak on behalf of Americans everywhere. We've come to ask you to reboot the national anthem. Please Mr. Abrams. We know you've been asked to reboot a lot.
Senator 2
[whispering] We know you're tired.
Lady Senator
We know you're tired.
Senator 3
[takes the megaphone] What do you say, sir? We all want something new and that makes us remember the things we lost. We want to 'member! We need your 'member berries! [Abrams mulls it over]
Male Senator
One light means yes, two lights means no. [Abrams reaches to his left and one light comes on. The gathered crowd goes wild.]
South Park Elementary gym, day. Cartman holds a school assembly
Cartman
Fellow students, as you know, an Internet troll by the name of Skankhunt42 has been harassing women and girls by making degrading comments on our school message board. The girls are very upset, and many male students believe that it's just because girls don't have a sense of humor. I beg to disagree. Girls rule, women are funny, get over it. Just the other day, in the hallway, I heard two male students saying how the new Ghostbusters sucked balls. I was shocked and appalled. It is time for us all to realize and accept that girls are cool, and women are funny. Wendy? Wendy, could you come up here, please? Come on up, Wendy. Wendy Testaburger, guys. [some of the kids clap, Wendy stands up and walks over to Cartman] Wendy, go ahead. Be funny. [he holds the mic to her face, and she looks at him warily. He tried harder, she leans farther away] Say something funny, Wendy. We can't wait.
Wendy
I'm not funny.
Cartman
Hey, girls are funny, Wendy. Okay? Get over it. Just do women's comedy stuff. You know, talk about how fat you are and how you wanna have sex with guy and then say "my vagina" a lot..
Wendy
I don't feel like being funny right now.
Cartman
And that's just the kind of sexist bull-crap that's gonna keep you in the kitchen. Sit your ass down. [Wendy goes back to her spot on the gym floor] This isn't a joke, you guys. Girls are funny. Bebe, why don't you come up here? Come on, Bebe.
Bebe
NO!
Cartman
No? Come on, talk about havin' sex with guys, and say "vagina" and stuff like that. Go ahead. [looks her over quickly] Girls rule, women are funny. Bebe, get over yourself. Seriously.
Bebe
Get the mic out of my face!
Cartman
[moves away] Huh. Oh my God, that wasn't really all that funny. That's weird. Um, let's see. Red? You have any zingers for the crowd? No? How about you, Nelly?
Nelly
Yeah, I got one. You're a fat fuck! [Butters got a great laugh out of that one]
Cartman
K, that wasn't really funny, it was just angry.
Nelly
[stands up] You see, what the problem is, is that when a little troll is allowed to say anything he wants anonymously, then he speaks for all you boys!
Cartman
K, that's good, now just try to say it a little funnier now.
Nelly
Go ahead and get on our school message board and see what he's saying about us! Then see if you guys think it's funny!
Cartman
Okay, and then, and then, and then just go, "my vagina."
The Marsh living room. Randy is watching a news segment on CNN
News Anchor 1
And as our country seems to be more and more divided, the only hope is that J.J. Abrams' new national anthem will appeal to everyone and bring back those nostalgic member berries we know and love.
Randy
Oh great. Everything's getting a reboot now. [There's a knock on the door and he answers it.]
Pollster
Hello sir. I'm with the Gallup poll. We're trying to get a read on how people will be voting in the upcoming Presidential election?
Randy
Oh. Oh-okay.
Pollster
Great. And will you be voting for the giant douche or the turd sandwich?
Randy
Well, this is usually a giant douche household but... we're going firmly with the turd sandwich.
Pollster
Oh, the turd sandwich, huh?
Randy
That's right. [Sharon appears behind him and sees him talking to the Pollster] You can put my wife and I both down for turd sandwich.
Pollster
Well, good luck with that, heh. So far, giant douche is leading in the polls.
Randy
[shocked] What?
Marsh Dining Room
Randy
What the hell is wrong with people?! They really think that a giant douche should be President?? It's insane!
Sharon
Why'd you say I'd be voting for the turd sandwich, Randy? You haven't even talked to me about it.
Randy
You can't possibly be thinking about voting for the douche?!
Stan
Hhhawgh!
Randy
What's wrong with you?
Stan
I just don't understand why every four years you people freak out over whether to vote for a giant douche or a turd sandwich.
Randy
[snidely] Because we're Americans. 'Cause this is America
Stan
Why are we doing this again? Why are we back to giant douche and turd sandwich?
Randy
[holds his palms out like fans] Cyyynical. Cynical maaan. You just think everything and everyone is dumb, huh? 'Cause you're a nihilist.
Stan
It's nihilist.
Randy
See, you're such a nihilist.
News Report
News Anchor 2
Newest Gallup Poll results are in and they show Giant Douche to be leading Turd Sandwich by nearly 10%. Turd Sandwich has said there's no reason to panic.
Hillary Clinton (Turd Sandwich)
Polls are of course a useful tool, but they can often be misleading. Our campaign is holding strong.
Reporter 1
[after some clamor from the press corps] Mrs. Turd Sandwich?
Hillary
Yes, Arthur?
Arthur
Uh, Mrs. Sandwich, do you believe that your opponent will gain any momentum from this poll?
Hillary
I'm sure that like me, Giant Douche realizes that polls are never the final answer.
The Garrison/Jenner headquarters. Mr. Garrison and Caitlyn are dancing around to "Cake By The Ocean"
Garrison
Yeah! Suck that poll you dumb bitch! Up 10%. Can you believe that shit?! [walks over to the table on which the radio sits] Oh, Caitlyn. I think we're really gonna win this thing! Think about it. [softly, awed] In a couple of months I will be President of the United States. [begins to worry and turns off the radio] Caitlyn, can I ask you somethin'? Uh, when we actually get into the White House, like um, what are we gonna do?
Caitlyn
What do you mean?
Garrison
Well I mean, like, you know, once we're President and Vice-President, like, what do we do then?
Caitlyn
How the fuck should I know?
Garrison
[getting exasperated] Cait, you, you heard about the poll, right? We're probably gonna win. Don't tell me you don't have a plan.
Caitlyn
What plan? I thought you had a plan.
Garrison
I don't have any fuckin' plan! That's why I have you! I'm gonna be the President and you're gonna be in charge of all foreign and domestic policies!
Caityln
I thought you were gonna do that part.
Garrison
Are you tellin' me that we're about to be voted into office and we have no idea what the fuck we're gonna do?? [makes two fists] Ohhh Jeeez!
Mr. Mackey's Office, Kyle is talking to him
Kyle
I think they called it German Collective Guilt, right? Where even the Germans who just did nothing while Hitler rose to power were, were maybe somehow also responsible?
Mr.Mackey
Uh huh, uh, m'kay, okay.
Kyle
But I can't control what Cartman does, so, so why should I feel ashamed for what Cartman does?
Mr.Mackey
Well J.J. Abrams was just rebooting the National Anthem, Kyle, so everything's gonna be fine, m'kay?
Kyle
I don't think the answer to all this is member berries.
Mr.Mackey
You don't like mem- member berries?
Kyle
Agh, never mind. I'm just gonna stay out of it. [gets up and leaves the office. A few seconds later, Mr. Mackey opens a drawer in his desk and pulls out a mason jar with member berries in it. He opens the jar and lifts the berries out]
Berries
Oh I 'member. 'Member Chewbacca? Yeah. And 'member AT-ATs? Member? Ey! Hey, 'member Ghostbusters? Ohh, I 'member. 'Member Slimer? Oh, I loved Slimer. 'Member? Ohh, I 'member. [they keep 'membering]
Mr.Mackey
How could someone think these things are bad? [plucks a berry and eats it]
Decision 2016, Commander In Chief Forum, from HBC News
Announcer
The Commander in Chief Forum, with a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Moderator
Back now with the Commander in Chief Forum. I am joined by the Republican nominee, a giant douche.
Garrison
Thanks, Matt.
Matt
Mr. Douche, some say you don't actually have a viable plan in place if you were to be elected President.
Garrison
Huh! Huh well, well who said that? The turd sandwich?
Matt
In your campaign, you said that you will deal with our country's immigrants and enemies by personally [reading his notes] fucking them all to death. How do you plan to actually achieve that?
Garrison
Well, Matt, I don't think I said I would fuck them all to death.
Matt
Okay, well, let's roll the tape on that.
Garrison
Oh, sure, okay. [they sit back as clips from previous statements are aired. First, from the time the fleeing Canadian kids were enrolled at South Park Elementary] Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's "fuck them all to death!" [At Niagara Falls] Fuck them all to death! Let's make this country great again!
Crowd
Fuck them all to death!
Garrison
[St. Louis] And then I'm gonna take all the drug pushers in our country, and I'm gonna fuck them-! [another rally] And you know those people in Syria, I'm gonna fuck them! [in Washington, D.C., all worked up] That's how we'll make sure that every terrorist on earth is fuckin' dead! [in a desert] The leaders of North Korea? I'll fuck them all, yeah! [Club Emotion] Yeah! Yeah! [another rally] The criminals in our jails?! Fuckin' dead a day after I- [another rally] Yeah! Those ads that are tryin' to kill us? I'll fuck anyone in the advertising business! And they'll all die too!
Matt
So by our estimates, it's roughly 7.6 million people you have promised to fuck to death in your first year of office.
Garrison
Uh huh, okay.
Matt
And, and, you think that's achievable?
Garrison
I do. I do, Matt. Uh, I mean, I'm not gonna just get elected, you know, and, and look like a jackass. Huh, huhuh. [fearfully] Ohhh Jeeez.
South Park Elementary, preschool room. Class is in session
Teacher
Alright kids, today we have a very special treat. One of the older students has written an original children's story and is gonna read it to you. Come on over, Eric.
Cartman
[enters] Hi guys! [takes a seat] Are you all ready to hear a story?
Preschoolers
Yeah!
Cartman
This was a book I created all with my imagination. It's called "Little Red Riding Kyle. The story of a little gay boy and his adventure with four hilarious women. One day, Little Red Riding Kyle was walking through the forest thinking about guys. He was on his way to visit his grandma, who was a little black boy named Token." Get over it. "But then, a big bad wolf who was a hilarious woman named Janet walked into the house and said 'I have a large vagina' and traded place-" [Kyle enters and pull him out of the room.]
The hallway, moments later. Kyle shuts the door behind him
Kyle
What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman
Rebooting fairy tales to try and ease the friction caused by Internet trolls.
Kyle
You really think you're fooling anyone with this fake persona?! Everyone knows you're acting this way by day so you can be horrible to people on the Internet at night!
Cartman
Why would I do that, Kyle?
Kyle
I don't really care! Just don't drag me into it! [takes Cartman's book and slams it down on the floor, then walks away angrily]
Skeeter's Wine Bar,night. Randy is at the bar with Jimbo and Stephen
Randy
What is wrong with people, huh?! How can they vote against a turd sandwich more than a giant douche?! It's senseless!
Stephen
Randy, you gotta calm down.
Randy
[grabs onto Stephen] How can anyone be calm at a time like this?! [lets go] People actually think a turd is worse than a douche!
Stephen
Look, maybe you need some supplements to help calm your nerves. Have you heard of member berries?
Randy
Member berries?
Stephen
It's a new superfruit that helps you mellow out and relax.
Stephen's master bedroom, night. He leads Randy in, opens the top drawer of his dresser, pulls out a box and sets it on top of the dresser, closes the drawer, and opens the box. The berries are chatting away.
Berries
'Member The Fugitive? 'Member Akira? 'Member Alien Nation? Yeah, I 'member...
Stephen
The guys at work told me about them. Been taking them about six months now. I'll telling you, they really take the edge off.
Berries
'Member Explorers? The little kids in a spaceship? 'Member storm troopers? 'Member?
Randy
Oh, they're adorable. [plucks one and eats it]
Garrison/Jenner headquarters. A team of advisers is listening to Garrison as he paces around the room
Garrison
Come on, people! I need answers! Real solutions! You're my advisers, for Christ's sake! How do we do this?!
Adviser 1
Maybe, if you swam in a pool in Florida, you could contract the Zika virus. Then you fuck all the people you can, and hope they eventually die.
Garrison
That would take way too long! And there's no guarantee every pool in Florida has Zika!
Adviser 2
Could you use nuclear weapons? Then fuck all the bodies after the fact?
Garrison
[walks to the table and takes a seat] Ugh! What the hell do I do? If I win I won't be able to do what I promised. But every day I keep going up in the polls. Why did the Democrats have to elect such a turd sandwich?
Caitlyn
Maybe you should just quit.
Garrison
If I quit, I look like a total jackass. [gets up and walks away, stopping by the "Pin The Tail On The Donkey" picture with Hillary's face on it.] If I win the election, I look like a total jackass. I have to keep running, [turns to face the picture] but I have to make sure she wins.
dramatic music plays out
South Park Elementary, day. The kids are in the hallway, and Butters is laughing at something on his phone. Stan, Kyle, Jimmy, Craig, and Clyde stop and look at him
Butters
Haha! You guys see what Skankhunt42 did on the school server now? Hehe, he photo shopped a picture of Heidi Turner's mom with a dick in her mouth!
Craig
I wanna see.
Butters
[shows the other boys] Look! There's Wendy's mom with a dick in her mouth too! [Jimmy laughs and takes a closer look]
Kyle
Goddammit! [takes the phone from Butters] Do you guys even care how this makes the girls feel?!
Craig
We didn't do it.
Kyle
We all know who did! And if we don't do something, then the girls will eventually retaliate against us!
Cartman
[from a distance] Help! [the other boys see him as he runs to them] Help me! Augh! Aw! [reaches the other boys]
Butters
Eric! What happened!
Cartman
A bunch of girls! They cornered me in the gym! They said all boys needed to pay! They kicked and they hit me and, and they kept me down and drew this vagina on my face! [well, it's there, but with a pair of testicles attached to it] They said it was to send a message!
Clyde
That's a vagina?
Cartman
Yeah. See, here's the top of the vagina and there's the balls. [Kyle has lost interest] It's starting, you guys! None of us is safe anymore!
Kyle
[flatly] I didn't know vagina had balls.
Cartman
Yeah, no, they do! Vaginas totally have balls! Right?
Kyle
You're just trying to start a war, aren't you?!
Cartman
What do you mean? If vaginas don't have balls, what do they have?
Kyle
It's not gonna work, Cartman! I'm not gonna let you divide boys and girls in this school anymore! when this whole thing comes to an end, you're gonna be all on your own! [walks away]
Garrison/Jenner headquarters. Garrison and Jenner now have a bank of phones, computers, and phone directories on the table and they're cold-calling people with them.
Garrison
Hello sir, how are you today? I'm calling from the Campaign for President, just seeing if uh, I can get your support for Hillary Clinton today. Yes, I know she's a turd sandwich, but you know if ya, if you look past that, you know she, she really has a lot to offer. Well, I hear you, but sometimes in life you just gotta suck a turd, you know? Hello? [hangs the phone up up with anger] Dammit! This is impossible! Are you having' any success, Caitlyn?!
Caitlyn
I've tried to get people on board, but she's just such a turd sandwich. You're just gonna have to do something awful to throw the election.
Garrison
Every time I do something awful people just get more stoked on me! It's impossible to piss people off anymore!
CNN breaking news
Anchor 2
This is breaking news. The moment has arrived. It is here. J.J. Abrams says he has finished the new National Anthem.
Garrison
Turn it up.
Anchor 2
The anthem is sure to be fresh and exciting while recapturing the moments we all knew and loved. Democratic nominee Turd Sandwich said she will be in attendance to show her support for the rebooted anthem.
Garrison
Ohhh Jeeez.
Anchor 2
Let's all hope that this new anthem puts our differences aside and unites this nation once again.
Garrison
That's it, Cait. That's what I have to do. I'm gonna sit out the National Anthem on live television. Then everyone will have to vote for that turd sandwich!
The Marsh living room. Randy is relaxing on the sofa with his bunch of member berries.
Berries
'Member Spock? Yeah. 'Member tricorders? I 'member. And 'member Bionic Man?
Randy
Ohh, I 'member.
Berry
Oh I loved Bionic Man [Randy plucks him and eats him.]
Berries
'Member the Millennium Falcon? 'member Chewbacca again? Oh I love to 'member Chewbacca. I 'member. 'Member? Hey hey hey! 'Member when there weren't so many Mexicans? Oh, I 'member.
Randy
Wai- what?
Berries
Yeah, yeah, yeah! 'Member when marriage was just between a man and a woman? I 'member! Oh, I 'member. Oh yeahhh.
Randy
[fondly] Yeeah, I remember that. [catches himself] Wait.
Berries
'Member feeling safe? 'Member no ISIS? 'Member Reagan? Ohh, I 'member. Ooo, 'member? Ooo, 'member? [Randy sits up and spits out what's left of the berries he's eaten]
Randy
What the fuck's going on with these member berries?
Kyle's bathroom. There's a knock on the door. Kyle is doing his business on the toilet
Kyle
Yeah?
Cartman
[opens the door and comes in] Hey broship. Got a minute?
Kyle
What are you doing here??
Cartman
You were right, Kyle. Okay? I drew the vagina on my face. I tried to fool people, but you keenly noticed my one tiny error in that girls don't have balls.
Kyle
I'm going to the bathroom!
Cartman
Kyle, you have to try and appreciate what I'm doing. I know that a war is coming between us and the girls. I knew it the moment they sat out the National Anthem.
Kyle
[finishes up and hops off the toilet, pulling his pants up] They sat it out because you were harassing them online.
Cartman
Suppose for one second that I'm not Skankhunt42. And that I really have been doing what I've been doing to try and stop the damage he has done?
Kyle
Why would you care?!
Cartman
'Cause I'm scared, Kyle. I don't know if you've noticed, but race wars are back. And now if we get gender wars too??
Kyle
If we could just prove who the troll was, then the girls wouldn't be wanting a war, would they?!
Cartman
Yeah but... you can't track down an Internet troll, [peers down into the toilet] it's too bad.
Kyle
Just know this, Cartman! I'm going to prove who Skankhunt 42 is, whatever it takes! Everyone is going to know! And Skankhunt is gonna pay for everything he's! ever! said!
Jim and Mike are back, this time commenting on the '49ers/Panthers game.
Mike
Hello everyone, we are live at tonight's game between the '49ers and the Panthers, but of course what everyone is really here for, the unveiling of the new National Anthem rebooted by J.J. Abrams.
Jim
And Mike, this new anthem is said to have everything the old one had but, some new surprises as well. You'd have to be an absolute asshole not to stand and support it.
Mike
This is such a big night for America that both Presidential candidates are here. [Hillary stands up and waves to the camera] There you can see the Turd Sandwich waving to all four people excited by her. [A shot of Garrison and Jenner in their own box, with Garrison waving happily to the crowd] And there's the Giant Douche doing the same.
Garrison
When I sit down to not support this thing I'm sure to lose this election!
Announcer
Ladies and Gentlemen-
Garrison
Here it is!
Jim
And the Anthem begins, let's hope this fixes America.
Announcer
For our National Anthem we now ask you all in solidarity to please rise. [Garrison sits down] Or sit, or take a knee, in order to honor America. [Kaepernick, who has taken a knee, is as confused as anyone else]
Garrison
Wait a min- what, wait, what? Wait. [tries to strike a pose that isn't standing, sitting, or kneeling, but gets nothing.]
Jim
Ohhh! And J.J. Abrams has absolutely shattered expectations, Mike! Now whether people are standing, sitting, or kneeling, they are all honoring America. J.J. Abrams is a wizard, Tom. A wizard. [Colin Kaepernick is also trying to figure out what to do]
Mike
More people sitting now as Abrams has made it irrelevant. Who saw this coming?
Jim
And there's the rest of the Anthem, all the parts we remembered and loved. J.J. Abrams has fixed America.
Garrison
No, this was supposed to! Oh! OHHH JEEEZ!
Reactions from around the town. At her house, Wendy looks at the TV in the living room, then turns left and walks away with an angry look on her face. Bebe is in her own bedroom looking at the TV with an angry look on her face too, then clicks off the TV to go to sleep. At the Daniels' house, Nichole watches the anthem with her parents in the living room, and she's looking angry too. She hops off the sofa and walks to her room. Finally, Kyle is in his room staring at the ceiling with an angry look on his face.
Gerald
[opens the bedroom door] Hey Kyle. [Kyle looks at him] You okay, son?
Kyle
Yeah Dad. Just thinkin'.
Gerald
Well um, I'll be in my office if you wanna talk. [leaves and closes the door. He walks to his office at the end of the hallway]
Gerald's office. He goes in and closes the door, turns on the radio to a jazz station on 88.1 FM and heads over to his computer, takes a seat, and pours himself some wine. He goes straight to the South Park Elementary Message Board and logs in. His user name? Skankhunt42. Once on the board, he gets to work with determination on his face. He breaks out in a mischievous smile while he's plugging away
End of Member Berries

Skank Hunt
At the school gymnasium, the parents of South Park Elementary students are watching a presentation by Dr. Schroeder about internet trolls.
Dr. Wayne Schroeder
Nobody is safe. Nobody can hide from these monsters. Internet trolls are truly predators of society. As parents we find it hard to believe our children are doing these things online, and that is why I've been asked to come and speak to you about the student who has been trolling your school message boards.
He changes the PowerPoint slide, showing a defaced picture of Heidi Turner's mother an example of internet trolling by Skankhunt42.
Dr. Schroeder
This troll is known only as Skankhunt42. [He cycles to the next slide.]
Dr. Schroeder
We believe it probable he's one of the boy students here, since his favorite target seems to be women. Here, you can see Heidi Turner's mother photo shopped with a penis in her mouth, after she defended her daughter's right to sit out the national anthem.
The crowd gasps and talk among each other.
Dr. Schroeder
Since then, this child has been trolling all over the internet. Visiting message boards, and social media, and filling it with vile comments and hate-filled garbage. [The camera pans to Gerald smiling as Dr. Schroeder talks.]
Dr. Schroeder
But trolling is on the rise with teenagers, and we all need to come together to stop it. We need every parent to look for the signs in their own child.
He changes PowerPoint to a slide titled 'Signs That my Child is a Troll'.
Dr. Schroeder
In order for us to find these secretive monsters, we need all parents to ask themselves: "Could my child be a troll?".
Sheila and Gerald's car, at night and after the PTA meeting.
Sheila
My God, what children are capable of now. What kind of hate would have to be in that child's heart?
Gerald
Well, you never know, could be someone who just, kind of thinks it's funny to stir the pot and watch everyone freak out. [Sheila gives Gerald a questioning look]
Gerald
Uh, you know! Maybe the fact that it's so not funny makes it somehow funny, to kids? Gosh, I-I certainly don't understand it.
A bridge over a river, snowing. The same picture is reposted by Butters on Twitter, and Heidi looks at it on her phone sadly. Heidi then slowly walks to the side edge of the bridge. Surveying the drop, she types on her phone whilst tearing up. The camera pans up, a splash is heard, and two white birds fly past.
South Park Elementary, day. Police cars are parked outside the school. Kyle walks down the hallway past sad kids and police officers who are interviewing the teachers. He turns his head to see Bebe bawling and another girl comforting her who is also bawling. Kyle then meets Stan and Clyde.
Kyle
Dude, what's going on?
Clyde
You didn't hear?
Kyle
Hear what? What happened?
Stan
Heidi Turner. She... she quit Twitter.
Kyle
Oh no. [Heidi walks past them, looking down.]
Stan
Yesterday after school, she wrote one last tweet that said goodbye forever, and then just got off for good.
Kyle
She'll get back on.
Stan
No dude, she threw her phone in a river. She's... she's gone.
At the South Park Elementary library, Mr. Mackey sits in front of a group of 4th graders to help them cope with their loss.
Mr. Mackey
Alright students, I know we're all dealing with the loss of a good friend. We have to accept the fact that Heidi won't be on social media anymore. I know we're all gonna miss her, m'kay. We're gonna miss, seeing what she's up to; miss seeing her silly pictures she'd post of her and her friends, m'kay.
Bebe breaks down and starts crying; Red shifts over to comfort her.
Mr. Mackey
But this is what can happen when someone gets bullied online to the point they just can't go on anymore. [Kyle angrily looks over at Cartman.]
Mr. Mackey
I know that some of you are feeling anger, m'kay. [Annie, Wendy, and Nichole are angrily looking down] Some of you are feeling a little guilt, asking how something like this can happen. But the best thing we can do for Heidi, is come together as friends, and as students, m'kay.
Mr. Mackey
So now, why don't we all get on Twitter, m'kay, and just tweet some of the, things we loved about Heidi, m'kay?
Everyone takes out their phones and an begins typing tweets on Twitter in memory of Heidi. Bebe continues weeping.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay. Oh, that's nice, that's nice, m'kay. Oh, that's a good one Sarah, uh-huh. That-that's a - that's a pretty poem. Nice Butters. Oh, Heidi would have loved this so much. This is so special, m'kay.
At the South Park Elementary cafeteria, most girls are upset and the boys are eating at a table.
Stan
Okay. Can we all agree now, [Stan glares at Cartman] that whoever is doing this, needs to stop?
Cartman
Totally, you guys; this has gone far enough. [Kyle looks unimpressed.] The girls are really pissed off at us. [He drinks from a milk carton.]
Stan
So tonight, whoever is doing this, isn't going to do it again! 'Cause if he does, we're gonna have to do something about it!
Cartman
You hear that guys? It'd better not happen again tonight! [Kyle still looks unimpressed.] I am so, seriously.
Broflovski residence, night. Ike is playing Minecraft on his computer. Gerald enters Ike's room
Gerald
Ike? Can I talk to you? [Takes a seat on Ike's bed] Come on, pull up a chair.
Ike stops playing and sits next to Gerald.
Gerald
You know, we had a big parent meeting at the school tonight, and uh, apparently, there's someone trolling the school message boards and, putting... penises in people's mouths. And whoever it was then got a big reaction from it, so he's now putting penises in people's mouths all over the internet. And... he's actually getting pretty famous!
Gerald
Sooo, Annie Jerkin's mother started an online campaign to stop internet trolling with a picture of her and her daughter, and you know what happened? She got a dick in her mouth!
Gerald
Ha-okay, okay, I know, it's just guy humor stuff, you know. We can laugh about about it here, but, it is serious too. Well, love you pal. Get to sleep, it's a school night.
Gerald smiles at Ike before leaving. In the hallway, Sheila encounters Gerald
Gerald
Oh, hey!
Sheila
Did you talk to him?
Gerald
Yeah, yeah, we talked. It was good.
Sheila
Oh, that's good.
Gerald
Yeah, well, I'd better go and get some of my work done.
Sheila
Oh, right, right, yeah.
Gerald
Yeah, don't wait up. I'll be a while with these stupid case profiles.
Sheila
All right. Night Gerald.
Gerald
Night sweetie. [Gerald receives a kiss from Sheila]
In his office, Gerald turns on the lights and puts Smokin' by Boston on his turntable in the background. He pours some wine from a hidden compartment into a glass, sits at his desk, puts on his glasses, and starts surfing on Facebook. Text boxes pop up as background impressions voice over them.
Woman 1
Hey! Just wanna remind everyone about the ice cream social to benefit homeless teens. Looking for volunteers.
Gerald
Hey, I'd like to volunteer to kick you in the vagina! Where do I sign up?!
More surfing of Facebook
Woman 2
This is my daughter at the triathlon today! Go little girl!
Gerald
Your daughter has a mustache - what the hell is wrong with your ovaries bitch?!
Camera pans away from Gerald. A woman looks appalled after reading Gerald's post on her computer. Another woman is in shown also shocked. Gerald continues his trolling onslaught.
Commentator
You've been dick-slapped!
A couple are dining at a restaurant, but the woman becomes outraged after reading another of Gerald's posts on her phone. The man also becomes outraged after she shows it to him.
Gerald types on his 2 computers along to the notes of a keyboard. In a bathroom, a man on the toilet is startled after reading yet another of Gerald's post on his tablet. Explosions of various buildings start appearing. Gerald continues his relentless assault, also targeting Annie, who becomes enraged.
2 elephants are shown humping. A clip shows how Gerald photoshops dicks into women's mouths. Then at a Boston concert, Gerald reenacts playing the keyboard by typing on his computers. A traditional man spins 2 rods that are on fire.
Finally, Gerald yawns and calls it a night, taking his glass of wine and leaving the room. South Park Elementary, day. The girls are gathered at the playground, and Wendy paces back and forth
Bebe
You should've seen what he said about my mother on her Instagram! Pages and pages of disgusting things!
Annie
This is an attack on all of us! It's time to make the boys suffer!
Wendy
It has to be swift and serious. We have to make a statement. The girls in South Park aren't going to be treated like afterthoughts anymore!
Girls (except Heidi Turner)
Yeah!
A backview shot of the boys is shown, with the girls in the background.
Annie
This has gone on too long and it's time to do something!
Girls (except Heidi Turner)
Yeah!
Clyde
[The boys are now the focus.] What do you think they're talking about?
Butters
They're talking about how they're gonna get us - what do you think? That's how the world works now. You get blamed for the group you belong to, even if you didn't do nothing!
Boy's Restroom, outside.
Butters
What are we gonna do about them?
Boy's Restroom, inside. The boys are gathered and Stan paces back and forth
Kyle
The girls want to see Cartman punished so we have to prove it's him.
Craig
We're never gonna prove that and you know it! We have to make him stop!
Butters
He's not gonna stop, he's loving all this! He wants the girls to hurt us!
Clyde
Then let's end it.
Jimmy
What do you mean?
Clyde
Cartman is the cause of all our problems. Always. We all know what has to be done.
The boys look at Clyde with surprise and dread. Stan stops pacing
Clyde
It's not like we haven't talked about it before - fantasized about how we'd do it.
Kyle
Yeah, but not like we'd actually do it.
Stan
Clyde's right.
Kyle
Stan... You can't be thinking that we'd-
Stan
What else do we do Kyle? You know better than anybody what a monster he is.
Token
He pushed everyone too far.
Butters
It's him, or us!
Kyle
Are we seriously talking about doing this?
Craig
How would we ever get away with it?
Stan
We do it out in the woods. I know how to get him to go.
In the school hallway, Cartman listens to some music while sitting. He notices the boys walking up to him
Cartman
'Sup dudes?
The boys are all looking down. Stan talks in an unenthusiastic tone.
Stan
After school, we're gonna go to my uncle's cabin - in the woods. We're gonna have a slumber party and play Counter-Strike all night with no one around to bother us.
Cartman
[Stands up excited] Are you serious?! All night broship Counter-Strike party? That's fucking sweet! Does your uncle's cabin have good wifi?
Stan
Yeah, but don't tell anyone where you're going. We don't want adults to know cause there's gonna be a ton of junk food.
Cartman
Bros!! Dude, that's so awesome! This is gonna be the best night ever!
Counsellor's office. Mr. Mackey sits at his desk holding a bunch of Member Berries.
Berries
'Member TIE fighters? Oh, 'member Jawas? 'Member? Hey, 'member Jurassic Park? Ooh, you love Jurassic Park. 'Member Jeff Goldblum? Oh, I 'member Jeff Goldblum - he was really tasty. [Mr. Mackey plucks one berry and eats it] I love Jeff Goldblum. 'Member?
Mr. Mackey
Mueeh...
Scott Malkinson barges into the counselor's office, startling Mr. Mackey who quickly puts away the Member Berries in his desk drawer.
Scott
I can't do this anymore! I can't take it!
Mr. Mackey
Oh! Er, hi Scott.[Scott sits on the chair in front of Mr. Mackey.]
Scott
Nobody ever pays attention to me! Nobody cares! I just want to end it all!
Mr. Mackey
Scott, come on, we've talked about this. You don't wanna quit Twitter.
Scott
Why not?! Everyone would be happier if I did!
Mr. Mackey
Who'd be happier?
Scott
Everyone.
Mr. Mackey
Well, what about your parents, huh? How'd you think they'd feel if you quit Twitter?
Scott
I don't think they'd even notice!
Mr. Mackey
Of course they'd notice. They'd be saad, m'kay, they'd be saad. You've got so much ahead of you Scott; so many posts and tweets still ahead of you. You haven't even started to see what social media has to offer you. You can't-you can't just end it all. Not now.
Scott
You're right, I guess I don't want to quit Twitter.
Mr. Mackey
There you go, m'kay? But now you come back here anytime you're having bad thoughts, m'kay?
Scott
Okay, thanks.
Scott leaves the office. Mr. Mackey starts to retrieve the Member Berries, but Scott barges in again, forcing Mr. Mackey to return the Member Berries again.
Scott
Twitter would be better off without me! I'm quitting!
Mr. Mackey
Okay, okay. Now, Scott-[Scott takes the seat again]
Scott
What's the point!? Better to just end it all now!
Mr. Mackey
O-kay...
In the woods the boys, who are still looking down and unenthusiastic, and Cartman, are trekking along a dirt path, bringing along their electronics.
Cartman
This is gonna be so awesome. Just hanging with the bros playing Counter-Strike all night. Alone in the woods - you pumped Token?
Token
Yeah, I'm really excited.
Cartman
I'm totally gonna do some massive pwnage. Whoever's on my team will be stoked. My laptop's so fast it doesn't lag at all. I can jump around like a pwnage powerhouse.
Clyde
I'm sure you will.
Cartman
You guys all seem kinda, like, bummed out. Is everything cool?
Stan
Everything's fine Cartman. We'll just get there sooner if maybe we don't talk much.
Cartman
Okay, cool. Goin' a long way to play Counter-Strike. Guess it's sweet though there won't be any adults to screw it up for us. How much further now?
Kyle
We're almost there.
At sunset, they arrive at the cabin.
Cartman
This place has sweet wifi, right? Gon' be so awesome.
In the city, at a campaign-headquarters during the day, a supervisor is walking around.
Man
Oh my God. Oh my God! Oh my God!
Supervisor
[Walks to the man.] What's wrong?
Man
Someone keeps trolling our campaign site!
The supervisor takes a closer look at the man's computer screen.
Man
He just keeps leaving horrible comments, and now he's attacking me personally!
Supervisor
Aww, don't let him get to you.
Man
Don't let him-?! He took a picture I posted and put a dick in my mouth! Who does that?!
Supervisor
Someone who probably still lives with his mother and hates himself. He obviously has nothing better to do. Just let him wallow in his own misery.
At his house, during the day, Gerald leaves the house very cheerfully. Steal My Sunshine by Len starts playing as Gerald strides down the road. He cheerfully gets out of the way of a car after the driver honked. Passing by 2 neighbors arguing about the election ignorantly, he nearly gets knocked over by a biker, but blissfully passes it off.
At the supermarket, Gerald picks up a bottle of wine and happily skips to the checkout, passing by the Member Berries' section
Berries
'Member the Cantina? Oh-hoh, I 'member. 'Member Star Destroyers? Yeah, I love Star Destroyers! 'Member?
Woman 3
[To the cashier.] I have a coupon for that too. An-and those are 6 for $4 with this coupon. [To Gerald] Sorry.
Gerald
Oh, no please. It's no problem at all!
On his way home that evening, Gerald slowly dances back to his house.
Outside his office at school, Mr. Mackey is locking up, but Scott Malkinson walks up behind him.
Scott
I'm gonna do it! [Mr. Mackey turns a worried, then frustrated look] I'm gonna quit Twitter, I mean it this time!
Mr. Mackey
Ohh, Scott, uh, I-it's sort of after hours, m'kay?
Scott
They all laugh at me. They won't be laughing when I do it! I'll show them!
Mr. Mackey
Hah, alright Scott. Come on inside. Huumm...
He unlocks the office door, then goes inside with Scott.
In the woods, at night, the boys finally reach the cabin.
Cartman
Oh, dude, is this it? This is cool. So isolated. [Camera shows a hole and shovel in the ground] Check it out, there's a shovel next to a hole dug in the ground.
Inside the cabin, Cartman eagerly goes over to the table at the far end and puts his items on it, while the boys form behind him.
Cartman
Dude, is this where we're gonna play? I call dibs on this side! What's the wifi called? Is there a password?
Kyle closes the cabin door. Everybody takes out a weapon, except for Cartman.
Cartman
I don't see it - I don't see it coming up on my laptop. I don't know, I think maybe the wifi's not working. Where's the box? [Cartman picks up his devices]
Cartman
You gotta unplug it and plug it back in. [Turning around] You guys? You guys...? There's...no wifi...
Clyde
The girls are gonna do something drastic to us. We have to take matters into our own hands.
Cartman
What are you...What are you guys talking about - What-
Stan
You brought this on yourself, Cartman. We're sorry.
Cartman
Oh my God. Oh my God, you guys are gonna break all my stuff so I can't get online!
Kyle
Just put your stuff on the table and step back.
Cartman
Please! Please don't break my stuff you guys! This is like, 2 Christmases and a birthday worth of stuff! You guys can't do this! Please!
Token
Let's just get it over with!
Cartman
No, don't-get-it-over-with! Don't break my stuff! I'm not SkankHunt, I'm not! You guys, you guys, you don't have to do this! You-don't-have-to-do-this! We can still just play Counter-Strike, and forget everything! Oh-my-God, there's no wifi - We can use my phone, to make a hotspot and we can still play Counter-Strike! And it'll be sweet! You guys, come on, please! Please, you can't!
Clyde
I can't listen to this!
Cartman
Please, Clyde! Clyde, you're my friend! Please, y-you know how much - I - need - my - stuff!
Craig
Let's just get it over with! [Walks up to Cartman]
Cartman
No please! If I can't get online, I won't-how would I-I- Mumbling.
Craig stabs Cartman's laptop with his knife. The rest of the boys start advancing forward.
Cartman
No, God! No! Don't! Don't!! Don't!! Oh my God!!
Cartman's electronics are knocked onto the table, and subsequently destroyed by the boys
Cartman
Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Oh my God!! Aahh!! Niah!! Niaah!! Iaahh!! Iaahh!! Niaaahhhh!!!
Cartman passes out. Outside the cabin after some time, the hole is filled up, and Token pats the soil with the shovel. The boys look horrified.
Stan
What have we done?
Kyle
What we had to do.
Cartman
[Off screen.] Iaahh!!
In his bedroom, with the lights off, Mr. Mackey is sleeping when his phone starts ringing. Mr. Mackey jolts up from the ringing, puts his glasses on and sees the caller is Scott Malkinson.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, Goddammit. You've got to be kidding me. [Sighs, then answers phone.] This is Counselor Mackey. What's going on Scott?
Scott is on his phone while off his bed, grabbing onto a pillow.
Scott
I swear to God I'm gonna do it this time.
Mr. Mackey
Okay Scott, just try to calm down. You don't want to quit Twitter.
Scott
Why does it matter? People would be happier if I just did it!
Mr. Mackey
That's not true, no one would be happier. [Brings the phone away from his face.]
Mr. Mackey
This fucking kid, oh my god... [Brings the phone back to his ear.] Everybody thinks you're a great kid, Scott.
Scott
I-I talked to my dad. He said, "I don't have the guts to do it!". Well, if I'd quit Twitter, he'd be sorry!
Mr. Mackey
Okay, umm, how 'bout this, just umm, promise me you won't quit Twitter tonight, and we can - we can talk all day tomorrow, okay? M'kay?
Scott
I don't know if I'll make it through the night!
Mr. Mackey
[off phone] Oh, for fuck's sake...
Scott
I just feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff, you know, and being chased by hate. And the only way out is to jump!
Mr. Mackey
[on phone] Uh-huh, okay, go on with that.
Scott
I keep thinking about what the kids at school would do, when they find out I left all my social media. Like they would finally see all the damage they've done.
Mr. Mackey
[off phone] Goddammit, just do it already...
At home, at night, Gerald is again trolling online with Smokin' by Boston playing. However, just before leaving, his computer screen lights up with a Google alert, notifying Gerald that he was mentioned on CNN. Gerald clicks on the video link.
CNN Reporter
Another internet troll is wreaking havoc on message boards, this time attacking a Danish website for women with breast cancer.
Gerald
I made the news...
CNN Reporter
The troll, who goes by the name "SkankHunt42", ...
Gerald
[He claps his hands.] Yes!
CNN Reporter
...caused the website to temporarily shutdown. Danish Olympic Gold Medalist Freja Ollegard, who started the website, spoke out about the incident. [The inset video of Freja Ollegard zooms in.]
Freja Ollegard
I am not shocked. I am not sad. I am not giving this pitiful person the satisfaction of being anything. [Gerald listens intently].
Freja Ollegard
This little troll can have his fun. I am going to be the bigger person. I am going to show the people of Denmark are not so easily broken down.
Gerald
Hmm...Game on whore. Game on.
Gerald starts furiously typing on his computer, and a shadow appears on his wall by the computer screen's illumination. The camera pans to the shadow.
At South Park Elementary the next day, Kyle walks through the hallway again, but this time the girls are angrily slamming their lockers before walking away. He meets Stan and Clyde again.
Kyle
What's going on?
Stan
You didn't hear?
Kyle
Hear what?
Stan
The troll, SkankHunt, Kyle. He was all over the internet last night!
Kyle
No, that's impossible!
Stan
It wasn't him Kyle! We took Cartman out for no reason. [Cartman walks past looking down] We can't undo what we've done.
Kyle
Oh my God. Oh my God...
Inside Bebe's room, the girls are gathered. Wendy looks unsure.
Nelly
The time has come. We said if the trolling didn't stop, there would be severe consequences. Get the word out to every girl in school. It goes down tomorrow!
Wendy
Oh my God...I don't know if I can go through with this.
Nichole
We all have to be on-board Wendy. Every girl in school, or it means nothing.
Annie
Don't forget what you said Wendy: "For too long girls here have taken the backseat! Things have to change!". Now they'll have to listen.
At South Park Elementary, the following day, Gortoz a Ran by Denez Prigant plays in the background. Annie hides behind some hallway lockers till her boyfriend passes by. She catches up and gives a note to him, then leaves. The note reads: "I'm breaking up with you forever. Annie.". The boy falls to his knees, drops the note and yells as tears stream down his cheeks, 'No!' in slow motion.
Kevin receives a note too from Red, as well as all the boys with girlfriends. Girls run down the hallway holding notes like a deadly mob. The library. Clyde, clutching his hair, cries alone at a table with a note in front of him, tears streaming down his face.
Kindergarten couples also break up too, as a girl gives a boy a note that reads: "I brake up.". This results in the boy face planting into his toy blocks construction. Token also receives a note from Nichole at the basketball court that reads: "I break up. Goodbye. Don't call. Nichole". Token falls to his knees, broken.
In the Boy's Restroom, 2 boys who received notes resort to hugging each other for comfort. Playground. Kyle is sitting alone on the swings with his class picture in hand, and his eye starts tearing up when he sees Cartman fade from the picture.
In the hallway, any boys are crying in corners, notes strewn and crumpled. Stan walks down the hallway, glancing at the boys before encountering Wendy. Wendy regrettably holds out the note in her hand. Stan hesitantly takes the note, and reads: "This is goodbye forever, Stan. I can't fix you. Wendy". When Stan looks up, Wendy is gone from view
End of Skank Hunt

The Damned
[Simply Heidi. Her guest is Freja Ollegard]
Simply Heidi
We are back again with the brave Olympic gold medalist from Denmark, Freja Øllengård. Freja, you've talked about being trolled on the Internet and its consequences.
Freja Ollegard
Yes, Heidi. I believe trolling has a tragic effect on innocent people.
Simply Heidi
You have been the victim of horrific degrading attacks, spearheaded by a troll called [puts on her glasses] skankhunt42.
Gerald
[watching on his computer, holding a glass of wine] Nice.
Freja Ollegard
I've tried to just ignore the trolls, but that only seems to make them attack me more.
Simply Heidi
It must be so awful for you to create a Web site for women like yourself who are breat-cancer survivors and these... monsters get on and somehow make light of it. Even going as far as... ridiculing masdectomies.
Freja Ollegard
Yes, it's very disgusting, but I still try very hard to believe in the goodness of humanity. [cheers from teh studio audience.]
Simply Heidi
I can tell you that the support for you on our Web site has been overwhelming. We'd like to share some comments we've received, many from doctors who believe your Web site is saving lives. The first is a comment from a physician in Spain: "You go girl. You are doing great things. Don't let trolling stop you." And that is from Dr. Juerdior Titsgo [Freja is alarmed at the name], in Spain.
Gerald
[exults at his coup] He shoots, he scores! [Freya knows she's been trolled again and puts her face in her palm]
Simply Heidi
And there's this one: "Believe in yourself and don't listen to the haters. You're an inspiration." That's from Hungarian physician Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff.
Audience Member
Oh no...
Gerald
HA! [throws an air ball] From the 3-point line!
Simply Heidi
I'm sorry, am I missing something?
[The Broflovski house, day. Police cars are in front and a couple of officers are at the door. Officer Barkley rings the bell]
Gerald
Oh! Police! [sheepishly] Yes?
Officer
Hello, sir, we're conducting an investigation.
Gerald
Uh... regarding... uh regarding what?
Barkley
Do you happen to know this child? [shows him Cartman's picture from Photo Day]
Gerald
[relieved] Hoooh. Sure, that's one of my son's friends.
Barkley
Well, I'm afraid he's... quit Twitter.
Gerald
Hooo... another one, huh?
Barkley
Yeah, but this one's different. The events surrounding his quitting Twitter were very suspicious. Most people that quit Twitter leave at least three paragraphs stating that they're quitting Twitter before they quit Twitter. This child just stopped using it.
Gerald
Kyle! [looks up the stairs]
Barkley
We're simply trying to gather information on whether this was a Twitter suicide or a Twitter homicide. [Kyle appears at the top of the stairs]
Gerald
Kyle, have you seen your friend Eric online?
Kyle
[panics a bit] No. Uh, he quit.
Barkley
D'ya happen to know why, son?
Kyle
He probably got fed up with all the negativity and decided to end it. [shrugs] I don't know.
Barkley
Without tweeting a goodbye? People don't just quit social media. They post long drawn-out messages on social media, explaining why they're leaving social media.
Gerald
Look, officers, why don't you just go ask him why he quit Twitter?
Barkley
At where, sir? at where?
[Kyle's room, moments later. Kyle runs in and closes the door frantically, then whips out his phone to talk to some people]
Kyle
Okay, that was the cops! The cops were here!
Clyde
The cops? For what?
Token
You know for what! You know what we did to Cartman! [he's video-chatting with the other boys on his computer, in several windows]
Craig
We did what we had to do.
Kyle
But we were wrong!
Butters
[under his bed covers] It's not the police we have to worry about, it's Eric. He's gonna get us
Jimmy
Hey. W-we all just have to stay cool, okay?
Butters
It doesn't matter. He's comin'. He's comin' to get us.
[Stan's room. He's not part of the conversation. He sits on his bed looking at selfies of Wendy on his phone. Wendy on her bed reading a book and smiling at the camera. Another selfie of her in the sun. A selfie of her sitting at a counter. A selfie of her at a beach making a victory sign with her right index and middle fingers. A picture of Cartman licking the ass of a life-sized picture of him. That picture has him looking at a phone which has a picture of him looking at a phone...]

Randy
Stan? [Stan's door is open, so Randy walks in] You can't just stay in your room all day.
Stan
What happened, Dad? [Randy walks up to the bed] Everything's upside down. [Randy sits] Everyone's taking sides and splitting into groups. [thoughtfully] Everything sucks.
Randy
[rubs the back of his neck] Yeah, everything sucks. [lowers his hand] Everyone's divided. Nobody's getting along. And there's people like your MOTHER who are thinking of voting for a DOUCHE because she doesn't have a BRAIN.
Sharon
[off screen] Go to hell, Randy!
Randy
I don't know what's wrong with people in this town. More and more are agreeing with your mother. I tried getting on community message boards and swaying people's minds but... it always ends up with some asshole talking about vaginas and photoshopping a dick in my mouth. That's where we're at today. Everything sucks.
[Clinton campaign headquarters. She and her staff prepare for the debate]
Aide 1
Here's everything to prepare you for the debates, ma'am. Just try and stay focused no matter what your opponent says.
Aide 2
Don't let him rattle you. He's gonna do whatever he can to try and mess with your head. Bon't buy into it. Whatever he says, just respond with "My opponennt is a liar, and he cannot be trusted."
Clinton
Got it.
[The Presidential Debate]
Announcer
Decision 2016. The first Presidential debate, with moderator Lester Holt.
Lester Holt
Okay, let's get right into it. Our first question is for you, sir. How will you deal with ground troops in Syria?
Garrison
Everyone, I need to just speak from the heart here. Uhm, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I've gotta come clean. Uh, I had no idea I would get this far, [Holt looks confused] but the fact of the matter is, I should not be President. Okay? [Clinton's aides watch from a back room] I will fuck this country up beyond repair. [Clinton's aides smile at this admission] I'm a sick, angry little man. Please, if you care at all about the future of our country, vote for her. Okay? She's the one who at least has some experience. She, she's not as bad as you think, I promise. And unlike me, she's actually capable of running this country.
Clinton
...My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted.
Aide 1
NOOO!
Aide 2
Oh my God, she's such a turd sandwich.
Clinton
What he is saying is simply not true. Do not... believe it.
Garrison
[throws his hands up and then faces Clinton] I am giving you this, lady. I AM GIVING you this! What the fuck are you doing?! [faces the audience again] Okay, look, look, just, vote for her, she... she knows politics. She really wants to put this country first.
Clinton
My opponent is a liar-
Garrison
Would you just please shut up?
Clinton
-And he cannot be-
Garrison
Get out of your own way.
Clinton
-cannot be trusted.
Garrison
[in exasperation] Okay, okay, look. [stands up again] She doesn't mean what she's saying. She just doesn't know how to take this because... it's very weird and her advisers probably t-
Clinton
My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted. [as she says this, he throws his hands up and turns his back to the camera]
Garrison
Fuck, oh fuck, why the fuck does it have to be her? I am so fucked.
[South Park Elementary, day. Four of the seven boys who destroyed Cartman's electronics are in PC Principal's office.]
PC Principal
Alright boys, I've had just about enough of playing games. [before him are Kyle, Stan, Butters, and Token] The four of you were good friends with Eric Cartman, and yet none of you seem to know why he left social media. [Butters fidgets a bit] Nobody's get anything to say? Well I have a theory. I think... that Eric Cartman... was somehow forced to leave social media as a retaliation for Heidi Turner quitting social media! Now, because of the actions of one sexist, bogoted, racist troll! [sweeps his hand across his desk and knocks a stack of papers to the floor]
Butters
[lets out a] Eeeaaaahhhh!
PC Principal
We have a gender war on our hands! Make no mistake, gentlemen! Our community is under attack! And if we don't get to the bottom of it... there's gonna be more students like Eric Cartman... wandering the hallways with no connection to the rest of the world.
[The school hallways, later. Cartman walks down the hallway dejected. The kids around him are looking at their phones or talking on them as they go about their usual business. Cartman sees Kevin on his phone and sighs, then continues walking.]
Voice
[gruff whisper] Eric. [he looks up. By some exit doors is Heidi]
Cartman
Heidi? Heidi Turner?
Heidi
Come with me.
Cartman
Where? [she turns and walks off to her left]
[The neighborhood streets. Heidi walks, then stops and waits for Cartman]
Heidi
Join us. [points to a park] here.
Cartman
The park?
Heidi
I know how you feel, Eric. I know how hard it is when school gets out. With no phone, no human contact.
Cartman
[begins to cry] I miss my stuff.
Heidi
Come on. There are others like us here. [guides him into the park. A car appears and slows down]
Driver
Look at them, Martha. Do you see them?
Martha
What are they?
Driver
Lost souls who have quit Twitter. Damned to just wander the earth and hang out and stuff.
Martha
They seem so lonely. [they both look at their phones]
[Skeeter's Wine Bar, night. The doors open and Randy rushes in]
Randy
Okay, what?! The fuck?! Is wrong with you people?! I just saw a new poll that says more and more of you are thinking about voting for that douche!
Stephen
Some are. A lot of people like what he has to say, alright?
Randy
You're tellin' me that after that debate, you still wanna vote for that guy?!
Stephen
More than ever.
Ryan Valmer
Yyyup.
Randy
Did you see the same debate I saw?!
Stephen
Don't you get it, Randy? There's people in this country who are sick and tired. Tired of hearing all the rhetoric. Tired of Washington failing us while they pat their own backs. Finally someone comes along and says what he feels. That's why people like him. You can say what you want, at least he doesn't sound like another politician.
[Douche 2016 campaign rally at Pepsi Center. Garrison is speaking]
Garrison
America, please listen to me. I have no idea how to be President. I am a complete jackass, and I have made a giant mistake here. [the crowd cheers his honesty, which stuns him] Nononono, nononono, why are you clapping? I'm not a good person for the White House. I am not a good person, period.
Man
Finally, someone who doesn't talk like a politician.
Garrison
I am peeing my pants... at the thought of being President, okay? [more cheers go up] No! Shut up! Listen to me! [the crowd quiets down] You don't want a guy like me in the White House! You don't even wanna know the shit I've done!
Random Person
Wooohooo!
Garrison
I have scissored with another woman when I had a sex change!
Man 2
He's so honest!
Garrison
No, no! I'm not the guy you want going to Russia to negotiate with Putin. I'll probably end up gettin' drunk and tryin' to suck his dick. [more cheering. He turns away from the mic] OHHHH JEEEZ
[Ike's room, day. Gerald peeks in and sees him at the computer.]
Gerald
Ike, got a minute? [enters and sits on Ike's bed] Let's talk, buddy. [Ike pauses his game and goes to his bed] You know, the school really wants us to keep talking to our kids about trolling on the Internet and how serious it is. I guess the troll from the school message boards is now harassing a famous Olympic athlete from Denmark, heh. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah well, she kinda called him out and said he could never get her to quit social media, and you know, you might say she's askin' for it. But uh, now this troll is being copied by other trolls who are all dog piling to see if they can get her to quit and, well God only knows what they're gonna do tonight. Well, goodnight, pal. You be sure to let your mom know we talked more about the horrific consequences of trolling. [steps outside, then leans back and smiles at Ike, then leaves and closes the door]
[The park, day. Heidi and Cartman are sitting on a bench while a duck stands on the ground before them.]
Heidi
I want to tell you... that I'm sorry.
Cartman
For what?
Heidi
When women first started getting trolled on the school message boards. I was sure it was you. I was wrong.
Cartman
You weren't the only one. I guess I didn't deserve a second chance. I really tried to make changes. I really tried to become a better person. To sh-show that I was trying to listen.
Heidi
So when you held the assembly that woman were just as funny as men, you... you weren't being sarcastic?
Cartman
[earnestly] Women are funny, Heidi. Get over it. Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fuckin' mind.
Heidi
Do you miss your friends?
Cartman
I don't have any friends. I don't know if I ever did.
Heidi
You do now. [smiles at him]
Cartman
Kewl.
[Douche 2016 campaign rally at Pepsi Center. Garrison is speaking]
Newt Gingrich
Hello Florida! Please put your hands together and welcome the next President of the United States! [makes way for Mr. Garrison]
Garrison
I hate all of you so much.
Random Person
Yeah!
Garrison
I seriously hold so much contempt for each and every one of you pieces of shit. [cheers] If you vote me in as President I'll seriously throw up and have lost all faith in humanity. [more cheers]
Randy
[watching on TV] I agree.
Garrison
I don't wanna be here. Please just let me go. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know anything. I'm scared. I'm completely clueless how to proceed. I just... spew bullshit and cry myself to sleep at night. Stop thinking that I'm anything more than a douche in over his head. For fuck's sake, please.
Randy
Shit, I'm startin' to really like this guy.
[Skeeter's Wine Bar, day.]
CNN Anchor
And after stating that he was not fit to be President, Secretary Clinton responded with "My opponent is a liar and he cannot be trusted."
Patron
I am so confused.
CNN Anchor
In other news tonight, Danish gold medalist Freja Øllengård is the apparent victim of extreme trolling once again. [Gerald walks into the bar and watches the report]
Gerald
Oh. Eh hey, can you turn that up?
CNN Anchor
The athlete from Denmark has been the target of relentless online attacks that began with the troll skankhunt42. [Gerald smiles and looks around to see if anyone has figured out it was him who's the troll] Last night the trolling took a vicious turn when Freja Øllengård finally succumbed to the pressure and committed suicide. [Gerald's smile vanishes.]
Field Reporter
Paul, Danish women's volleyball champion Freja Øllengård has been pronounced dead outside her apartment in Copenhagen. [there's fear in Gerald's face] The four-time girls' medal winner took her own life after jumping 17 floors off the balcony of her building. [footage is shown of her doing this, with a klieg light focused on her all the way down. She lands on a car and shatters, blood going all over the place. The car's alarm turns on]
Paul
Freja Øllengård, dead at the age of 38. [Quickly, Gerald runs to the restroom and into a stall. A patron watches him enter and continues doing so until the scene ends]
Gerald
[on the toilet seat] Oh my God! Oh shit! Oh shit oh my God! Oh God oh no-oohh!
[The Stotch house. Someone knocks on the door and Stephen goes to answer it.]
Randy
I was wrong, Stephen, I'm votin' for your guy.
Stephen
[surprised] What?
Randy
It's just... [walks in] I see what you mean. He talks like an ordinary person. And he has a lot of the same emotions I do, you know? He's got my vote.
Stephen
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
Randy
[turns around] What?
Stephen
You wanna vote for that douche?! He'll ruin this country!
Randy
You were just voting for him yesterday!
Stephen
Yeah, but not anymore!
Randy
What happened??
Stephen
I don't know.
Randy
What the hell is wrong with people?! You just don't flip back and forth like that?!
Stephen
You just did.
Randy
[processes that reply] ...I did. What's going on, Stephen? Why does everything suck this hard?
Stephen
I don't know. Nobody knows what to think anymore.
Randy
But how did we get here? Completely confused and with shit for choices? It's like... it's like there are other forces at work.
Stephen
I'm just tired of thinkin' about it. Come on, let's relax and' have some member berry pie.
Randy
[thinks a moment] Member berry pie... [drops the thought] Okay, I love member berries. [follows Stephen to the dining room table]
[At the table. Randy has served himself a slice of member berry pie.]
Berries
'Member Tattooine? 'Member the torture droid? I 'member? Hi, 'member Goonies? I loooved Goonies. 'Member Chunk? 'Member? 'Member the trash compactor? Oh, the trash compactor.
Randy
[picks some berries up with a spoon, but stops] Wait a minute... [a camera pans away from the Stotch house into space, then moves east to Europe, then zooms in on Denmark.]
[Copenhagen, Denmark, at Rosenborg Park. Someone speaks over loudspeakers at Freja Øllengård's funeral outside the cathedral.]
Troll Hunter
[in a Danish accent] Citizens of Denmark, we are under attack. As our ancestors did in days long ago, we must rise to defend our families. [Freja's casket is slowly brought to the altar outside the cathedral] A troll has come into our village and taken from us a beloved princess. He then returned to his secret hiding place, crawled back to his little cave, thinking the Danes would simply cry and run. [a mourner sobs] No. What this troll doesn't realize is that we have been planning our own attack. I'm announcing here and to the world that a plan to destroy the troll is underway. For in Denmark there is one thing we have known for centuries. To get the troll to come out of hiding, you must say its name.
[Community park in South Park, day. Heidi sits on the bench alone, waiting. Cartman walks up and sits next to her]
Heidi
Hey.
Cartman
Hey. [long pause] I was thinking again. About how women are just as funny as men. And then I realized... that the only way to really be sure is to see if African-Americans think they're funny.
Heidi
Why is that?
Cartman
Because, black laughs matter.
Heidi
...Is that a joke?
Cartman
Yes, it is.
Heidi
I don't get it.
Cartman
Yes, you do. [Heidi just looks downward] Heidi, does it ever get any easier? Living in this world?
Heidi
The hardest part is not having any followers. I used to go places just to show them where I was.
Cartman
You wanna go somewhere? I'll follow you. [Heidi smiles]
[Hillvale Farm, day. Organic fruits and vegetable. Pick your own! YES! We Have Member Berries! Randy drives in and reaches the farm house, then steps out of the car.]
Jud
Mornin'. How can I help ya?
Randy
Yeah, I have some questions about uh member berries?
Jud
Yeah'. Everyone wants member berries these days. [turns left and walks off] Right over heah. [Randy joins him] Don't know what makes them so popular. I've had to get rid of all mah pumpkins, mah onions and mah peppahs, just to make room for more membah berries. [the voices of member berries get louder as they approach the berry grove. There are berries as far as the eye can see.]
Randy
Oh my God, there's this many?
Berries
'Member the 80s? Oh, 'member the 90s? Yeah yeah, but 'member the 80s though? Nonono, 'member the 90s?
[The supermarket, which is not a Whole Foods Market, day. Gerald walks out with his groceries looking at his phone. He approaches his car, which has a note under a windshield wiper. Gerald notices is, takes it from the wiper, and reads it. "Gerald Broflovski." He opens it, and reads the message inside, written in red marker: "I know who you are." Panicked, Gerald looks around and gets paranoid. He gets into his car quickly.]
Gerald
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! Protocol Zero. No evidence, clear history. E-mails! delete, delete, delete, erase, erase, trash, trash. [reaches into his glove compartment and pulls out a hammer called "Protocol Zero." He leaves the car with phone and hammer in tow. An elderly woman draw near as he smashes the phone to bits on the roof of his car. Once he's destroyed the phone, he gets into his car and peels out. He rushes home and runs up to his office. He turns on his computer and begins to delete stuff in the Gerald folder he has on there. After that he opens up the computer and pulls out the hard drive. He takes the computer apart, puts it all in a duffel bag and drives to Stark's Pond, where he sets up a portable foot-operated catapult and launches the duffel bag into the pond. He quickly rushes home again and sites next to Sheila on the couch. Sheila just glances at him]
Shelia
I saw Nancy Morris today. She has a different hair color. Again. I swear she doesn't think anyone even notices. Her natural hair color must be clear.
Gerald
[rushed] Our computer's broke.
Shelia
...What?
Gerald
It broke and I had to throw it away.
Shelia
I thought if a computer isn't working, you try and get it fixed.
Gerald
No now you just throw it away.
Shelia
You had all my recipes on that FileMaker program on your computer.
Gerald
I'll get us a new computer tomorrow. Then I can see if we can pull your recipes up from Ike's computer, and that way we- Ike's computer! Shit! [runs upstairs]
[Ike's room, moments later. Gerald runs in and towards the computer]
Gerald
Move move move! [pushes Ike out of the way and gets to work] My computer is off the network, and, and this computer didn't mirror that computer, but they did share the same Time Machine schedule, so then, would any of my files be accessible? No, because they didn't know each other's IP addresses. What if you can access my e-mail account from this computer through iCloud? If I go to iCloud, my e-mails are deleted. Good. Except there's a new e-mail. [It's from unknown] That shouldn't have come in. Why would an e-mail to me have come in if I deleted everything? [he reads the e-mail. It says the same thing the note did] "I know who you are." [spins around and points at Ike] You? Do you know who I am? Do you know who I am, Ike?
Ike
No, but I want to, Dad.
Gerald
[thinks of the Biblical sense] Not like that, smartass! [turns back to the computer and works on his account] Delete! Delete the account, not the e-mails! [gets an e-mail: "You have a Google alert!" He clicks OK and reads] "meet me under the freemont bridge. 9 am tomorrow." [panics] Oh God...
[M burgers, day. Cartman and Heidi are eating lunch there.]
Heidi
You dip your French fries in the sweet & sour sauce?
Cartman
Yeah. It's the best, dude. Try it.
Heidi
[tries it and eats] Wow, that's really good. I'm starting to feel like life isn't gonna be so bad.
Cartman
Yeah. I think I am too. Heidi, can I ask you something?
Heidi
Yeah, of course.
Cartman
Do girls... not have balls?
Heidi
Girls do not have balls, no
Cartman
So when a girl goes to scratch her balls, how does that work? [she wonders why he's asking] I just don't understand what's at the bottom of a vagina.
Heidi
[munches on a fry] Do you want me to show you?
Cartman
...Holy shiiit.
End of The Damned

Wieners Out
The camera runs through the mountains.
Narrator
Long ago, in the deep and frozen lands of Scandinavia, there were creatures who wreaked havoc on humanity. [A troll is seen] The Troll. They dwell in rocks, in caves, isolated from civilization. The creatures were ugly, fat and slow-witted, but some could look and behave like human beings. These are the most dangerous. Now, the creatures have returned, this time, a thousand miles across the sea. [Earth is seen as it rotates. It zooms in on America, and an internet troll is seen] Today, the monsters believe they can go undetected, [Different trolls are seen] free to attack and then retreat to the darkness. But in Denmark, we have dealt with the trolls before, and now and now, we shall deal with them... again.
The Broflovski living room. Gerald looks at the note, reading 'I know who you are'. Kyle comes up.
Kyle
Dad, can I talk to you?
Gerald
Sure, Kyle.
Kyle
All the girls at school are really mad. It's like, one guy gets online and says terrible things about girls and it reflects badly on all of us.
Gerald
Uh huh.
Kyle
Everyone's sad, everyone's depressed and nobody knows how to move forward.
Gerald
Good.
Kyle
I guess what I'm saying is, I'm starting to feel a lot of guilt, just for being a boy. How do I not feel that?
Gerald
Sorry Kyle, I have to meet someone. Talk to your mother. [gets off the couch] I love you! [walks away]
Butters' bedroom. Butters Skypes with Charlotte while she is in her room.
Butters
It's been a rough few weeks, Baby. The girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board, parents are all freaking out about the election and, and I tell you... you are glad to not be living in this country right now.
Charlotte
Butters,I'm sorry, but I told you not to Skype me anymore, right?
Butters
[becomes shocked] But Baby, I love you! I need you! You can't break up with me!
Charlotte
I have to stand with my girlfriends.
Butters
Oh my god, I can't believe they got to you. [starts shouting] Those sneaky snakes in the grass!
Charlotte
Who?!
Butters
Well you know who, the girls in my school! They all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them!
Charlotte
This is a time when women and girls have to stick together.
Butters
So then it's true! You're all snakes in the grass! Every [slams the keyboard] last one of you!
Charlotte
[ends the call]
Butters
Oh Charlotte? [presses on the mouse] Are you there? [presses on the mouse] Honey?
Gerald walks under the Freemont Bridge incognito and meets with Dick. Dick blows a puff of smoke at him.
Gerald
[takes off his sunglasses] I don't know why you are harassing me. I don't even own a computer.
Dick
My name is Dick.
Gerald
Are you with the NSA or Homeland Security?
Dick
No! I'm a colleague.
Gerald
A colleague?
Dick
You probably know me as "Dildo Shwaggins".
Gerald
Dildo Shwaggins from Pussystores.org?!
Dick
We need to talk.
Gerald
You're just a troll?! [turns to his left, raises his arms, and looks up] Oh thank god!
Dick
We're on the same team, Skankhunt.
Gerald
[lowers his hand] Wait, but that means I went "Protocol Zero" for nothing. Oh shit [throws his cup of coffee]!
Dick
What's "Protocol Zero"?
Gerald
[circles around and then sits] Everything's gone! I destroyed my computers, my phone! [looks at Dick] Why couldn't you just say, "I know who you are. I'm a troll too,"? Why do you have to be so fucking cryptic?!
Dick
Us trolls have to be careful. You know that.
Gerald
Look, I'm not really a troll, okay? I just started as a Yelp reviewer and got sick of how everyone's stupid comments sounded. I just like messing with people 'cause it was funny. I got carried away!
Dick
These are really dangerous times, Skankhunt. There are there are things happening in the world and trolls have to come together.
Gerald
For what?
Dick
Someone is trying to wipe us out! Our way of life is in danger.
Gerald
It's not a way of life! I was just doing it for the LOLs.
Dick
That's not true. I've studied your work. You're one of the best trolls I have ever seen.
Gerald
[stands up] No, no! I am done with this crap. I thought my wife was going to find out, [grabs his sunglasses] but that was too spooky. [puts on his sunglasses and walks away].
Dick
Gerald, we need each other. The Danish [raises his arms] are planning something horrible against us.
Gerald
[stops and faces Dick] I'm not one of you, okay? I just need to stop. [tries to climb up the steep dirt, but falls down].
South Park Elementary School Playground. A group of boys come together and form a semi-circle around Kyle.
Kyle
[talks while pacing back and forth] Guys, I've been thinking this over a lot and ... we need to be more active in showing the girls that we respect them. There's a big girl-volleyball game tonight and we should all go and show our support.
Stan
You really think that's gonna make a difference?
Kyle
I do. We need to show the girls that not all boys aren't the same and that we are willing to change. [stops pacing]
Butters
Well why don't you just shut the fuck up, Kyle? [talks while walking] All I've been hearing in a few weeks is how [stops walking]this is our fault, how boys need to change. Well I'm getting pretty sick of it. Everyone else seems to be proud about who they are, but not us; and then we get Uncle Kyle here telling us that the girls are right!
Kyle
Butters?
Butters
[turns towards and points at him] This is a war [walks from Kyle] on all of us. You want to listen to Uncle Kyle, we'll go ahead. Pretty soon [stops walking, and faces Tweek and Craig] they'll be locking us all up. And don't think you're safe either, Tweek and Craig. Just 'cause you're gay does not mean that you aren't looked down upon for being boys! [turns to his left] The world wants us all to feel shame just because we were all born with [points downwards] wieners!
Kyle
Butters, you need to calm down.
Butters
No! [walks towards Kyle] We tried doing it your way, Kyle. We tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us?
Clyde
Nowhere.
Butters
[turns around] Right! It turned us against one of our own match, that's what it did! What happened to Eric Cartman is the girl's fault, not ours!
Token
That's true!
Butters
I'm done feeling guilt. I'm a boy, dang nab it! And you know what? I'm proud of my little wiener. Mark my words, the moment is coming when you all need to decide; are you with your kind, [points at Kyle] or are you with Uncle Kyle.
The Broflovski living room. Gerald taps his fingers with boredom on the dinner table. Sheila then checks on her husband.
Sheila
Gerald, you've been sitting at the table for three hours now. You okay?
Gerald
[stops tapping] I'm great! Totally good. Just sitting down and ... doing nothing. Is there a problem with that? Is there a problem with just wanting to sit and just be? Is that illegal now?
Sheila
Not at all, Gerald. I'm sorry.
Gerald
I'm totally happy. I'm happy. I don't need to do anything to make me happy, fuck.
Sheila
Well! I know you said your computer was broken. So, I went ahead and got you something. [takes out iPad from a bag] Here, it's your own iPad.
Gerald
[gets frightened, stands up and tries walking away from Sheila] Ah! Ah ah, ah! No, no! I'm good. Get that away from me.
Sheila
[turns to her husband] You don't like it?
Gerald
No, sorry! I love it! I'm just swearing off electronics for a little bit. [leans closer to the iPad and speaks softer in a harsh tone] Or maybe I can just get on a couple of message boards. [backs away and speaks normally] No, I'm good! I don't need it!
Sheila
Gerald, [walks closer to Gerald] what's going on?
Gerald
Nothing, Sheila. I'm fine. [turns so his body faces the table] I'm just trying to make some changes and less electronics is part of it. I'm sorry, Honey. Everything is okay. Promise.
Sheila
Okay, Gerald. I'll make us some lunch. [walks to the kitchen] Oh uh, did that guy outside talk to you?
Gerald
[faces the front window] What guy outside? [walks towards the window and sees Dick on the other side of the road from his house] What the fuck? [checks on Sheila and then whispers to Dick] Go away, go! [waves his arms sideways] Go! Go away! Go go!
Dick
[shows a note to Gerald that says "WE REALLY HAVE TO TALK", then drops the paper to show the other note saying "IT'S IMPORTANT"]
Gerald
[whispers quickly, closes the blind and curtains of the window, and then walks away]
South Park Elementary gymnasium. A large crowd of people watch the girls volleyball game.
Sports Commentator
Welcome students and parents to tonight's matchup between the South Park Cows and the Bona Festa Demons.
Kyle
Dude, this is awesome! Did you see how many of the boys I've got to come out tonight?!
Stan
Yeah! This is a pretty sweet turnout!
Wendy
[smiles at Stan]
Kyle
This is exactly what we needed. Thank god people listen to me.
Referee
[blows whistle]
Sports Commentator
And now please sit, stand, or kneel for the National Anthem.
National Anthem plays
Butters
[takes off his pants and underwear, pulls his shirt, and raises his fist causing people to be shocked]
Jason
Holy crap, dude. Look at Butters.
other boys gradually start to follow Butters' actions except for adults, Kyle, and Stan
Kyle
Oh [hits his face] no!
South Park.
Gerald
[walks through town depressed and then quickly dodges a bicyclist] Son a bitch! Ahhh! [walks near the Community Center, reads a sign about addiction problems, and checks the group]
South Park Community Center. A group of guys are in a social group hosted by Randy.
Randy
Gerald. Hey come on in. You're not alone, bud. We're all facing the same struggles and trying to do something about it. Anyways please continue, Richard.
Gerald
[sits on the available chair to the right of Randy]
Richard
Well like I was saying, I've been addicted to memberberries for the past two months now.
Randy
It's okay, man. You're not alone.
Richard
It's just, you know, 'membering is more fun than thinking. I want so bad to go back to when things were good. When I was a kid, you know like, the 80s and the 90s, and things made sense.
Randy
And that's how we got here to this very memberberry election.
Gerald
What is this?!
Randy
What have been your struggles with memberberries, Gerald?
Gerald
I, I don't even know what a member--.
Berries
[muffled from Michael's pocket] 'Member the Dagobah? Yeah, I remember the Dagobah. That's where Yoda lives. 'Member Yoda?! Oh, I 'member!
Randy
[coughs] Michael, are there memberberries in your pocket?
Berries
Oh, 'member Corellian Corvette?! I remember Corellian Corvette!
Michael
[sqishes the memberberries] Nope!
Randy
Anyway, Gerald, what has your experience been?
Gerald
I don't even know what memberberries are.
Stephen
Gerald, come on. The first step towards healing is admitting you've got a problem.
Gerald
Yeah. [stands up and points at Stephen] Well you've got a fat pussy, and you should go and fucking kill yourself! [calms down] Sorry, I think I'm in the wrong place. [walks away]
South Park Elementary: Principal's Office. PC Principal talks with Wendy, Bebe, Annie Knitts, and Nichole.
PC Principal
Make no mistake! I want to be very upset. However, as a community, we have all decided that people have the right to protest the National Anthem.
Wendy
They took their wieners out!
PC Principal
[points upwards] Correct! [lowers his arms] But they did so peacefully and without malice towards others.
Wendy
This was an attack on us. This is exactly why we sat out the National Anthem in the first place!
PC Principal
I want you to understand something, ladies. [positions his hands parallel from each other] I am in a PC Pretzel here because if I say [moves his hands to his right] they can't protest even though [moves his hands to the left of him] you protested [moves his hand back towards the middle] and the only difference is that their protest included physical gestures, then I'm body shaming!
Bebe
So you're just gonna let the boys take their wieners out whenever they want?
PC Principal
That's what happens when you sit out the National Anthem.
South Park Elementary: hallways. Stan and Kyle put their stuff in their lockers. While hearing Butters, they face him in shock.
Butters
[speaks through a microphone while rallying a group of boys with their pants pulled out] We walk together in peace! We walk together in peace! We're not poor for feeling ashamed in who we are! We're not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born! Wieners out!
Wieners Out Boys (expect Butters)
Wieners out!
Butters
Don't let anyone tell you you are somehow nice because you're a boy! Don't let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener, as if your wiener is a bad thing!
Wieners Out Boys (expect Butters)
Yeah!
Butters
What makes us different makes us beautiful! No more shame, no more doubt, no more bigotry!
Wendy
[runs away from the rally]
Wieners Out Boys (expect Butters)
Wieners out!
Butters
Don't be an Uncle Kyle! Be proud of who you are!
Stan
[pulls down his pants and joins the rally]
Butters
You are either with us or against us! It's really that simple!
The Broflovski master bedroom. Gerald brushes his teeth when he suddenly hears a flute playing. He checks the window and sees Dick playing on a tree branch.
Gerald
[whispers] Damn it! [waves his arms away from the window] I live here! Stop that! [shuts the curtains and lies on the bed next to Sheila]
Sheila
[stops reading and faces Gerald] You don't have to work tonight?
Gerald
No, nothing!
Sheila
Wow! I don't remember the last time you were able to get in bed the same time as me.
Gerald
Got all caught up with work!
Sheila
Hey, I'm not complaining. [closes her book] It feels good to have you here.
Gerald
[gets off the bed and runs away] I'm going on a run!
South Park. Gerald is going for a run.
Gerald
[gets surprised by the car honking at him] Ah! [raises his fist] Fuck you! ["flips" his index fingers] Fuck you!
The Broflovski master bedroom at 2:43 a.m. Sheila is sleeping.
Gerald
[talks from the master bathroom] Yeah!
Sheila
[fully wakes up]
Gerald
Screw you, Skank! You fat little bitch! Go kill yourself, whore!
Shiela
[gets off bed and walks near the master bathroom].
Gerald
Yeah, fuck you, bitch! Fuck you! [chuckles]
Sheila
Gerald? [opens the door, gets scared of the Gerald's creepy face, screams, and runs away]
Gerald
[lays iPad in the sink and chases Sheila] Oh, sorry, Hun! Sorry!
The Broflovski hallway. Kyle notices Sheila screaming and exits his room.
Kyle
Everyone all right, guys?
Gerald
Everything's fine, Kyle. Go back to bed.
The Broflovski kitchen. Gerald and Sheila sit down on the table to have talk.
Sheila
[wipes her eyes with tissue] One night you, you say all of our computer stuff is broken and you, you hide everything and then you show up with all of this new equipment and now this! Please, tell me what's going on!
Gerald
Nothing is going on!
Sheila
[points at Gerald] You hissed at me! You went [faces to her right, hisses, and then faces back at him].
Gerald
Okay, okay. I'm going to tell you the truth, Sheila. I watch porn on the Internet. I'm sorry. I'll try to stop.
Sheila
But I know you watch porn. You told me you watched porn and I told you that I don't care, Gerald.
Gerald
Oh yeah! But uh, it's uh, but this is different.
Sheila
Why?! Because it's not normal porn?
Gerald
Right!
Sheila
Like something really embarrassing?
Gerald
It's really embarrassing.
Sheila
Tell me!
Gerald
It's... porn! It's... uh, piss! Porn! Piss porn!
Sheila
Piss porn? Like people peeing on each other?
Gerald
[stands up] See?! [walks closer to Sheila] It's so embarrassing! No wonder I hid it, right?! [wipes his forehead] Whew! [moves closer to Sheila] I'm sorry! It's good to get it out in the open though. [walks to bed]
Sheila
Do you want me to pee on you?
Gerald
[stops and turns around] No!
Sheila
You only like watching other women pee?
Gerald
[walks closer to Sheila] Oh no, no! It's not like that.
Sheila
[turns around] Because they're pretty? You have to watch around a video because I'm overweight and old?
Gerald
No! I, I, I want you to! I just couldn't ask.
Sheila
You do, promise? [faces Gerald]
Gerald
[in complete shock] Yes?
The Broflovski master bedroom. Gerald lies on the bed with his top off. Romantic music plays as Sheila walks out of the master bathroom and onto the bed over Gerald's head, while wearing a sex outfit and peeing on him. Gerald gnarls moving his head back and forth.
Sheila
Am I doing it right, Gerald?
Gerald
Yep! [gnarls]
Ike
[watches Gerald and Sheila from the hallway]
Gerald
So hot, I mean [gnarls] warm! [gnarls some more]
Kyle
[walks behind Ike and gets shocked by Gerald and Sheila's actions]
South Park Elementary: hallways. Eric Cartman sits on the stairs sewing a necklace and Kyle approaches him.
Kyle
Hi, Cartman.
Cartman
[looks at Kyle] Hey, Kyle.
Kyle
I'm so sorry, what we did to you. This Internet troll has everyone going crazy. We shouldn't have assumed it was you. We shouldn't have broke all of your stuff.
Cartman
Cool. That's cool.
Kyle
No! I know it's not cool. I know you're figuring out how to get back at us.
Cartman
I saw a vagina, Kyle.
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
I'm not holding a grudge. I'm happier now. I have purpose.
Kyle
You saw who's vagina?
Cartman
My girlfriend's. She stood six feet away and flashed it really fast. But in that instant, you know what I saw? I saw that humankind can colonize Mars. I saw the potential of our species to terraform other planets and reach the infinite.
Kyle
[lays his hand on his forehead] Yeah right, okay. [lowers his hand] I'm being serious, Cartman. Butters needs to be taken down a notch and you're the best at that.
Heidi
[overlaps Kyle's last few words and approaches Eric] Eric, hey! I got us both chocolate milks.
Cartman
[stands up and talks to Heidi] Of course you did 'cause you're amazing. Look at what I made you.
Heidi
The pink and blue one?!
Cartman
That's what my baby wanted.
Heidi
[raises her arms and cheers] Yay, [lowers her arms] put it on me!
Cartman
[puts the necklace on Heidi and faces Kyle] Oh sorry. Heidi, you know Kyle?
Heidi
[faces Kyle] Oh yeah. Hey, Kyle. [talks to Eric while they hold hands] The show's on at five tonight if you want to watch it at your house or my house.
Cartman
Oh either way, we totally can. I, I guess Kyle has something to talk to us something about first, um. [talks to Kyle] Go ahead, Kyle.
Kyle
[in complete shock] The, the school is in trouble and, um our friends are...
Cartman
He said something about us working together to take down Butters.
Heidi
Why? What's going on, Boo?
Cartman
I'm not sure, Boo. [faces Kyle] Could you start from the beginning, Kyle? [faces Heidi] Heidi is amazing at figuring stuff out.
Kyle
[pauses in complete shock]
South Park park. Gerald sits on a bench and starts gnarling after seeing a dog pee on a tree. Dick sits down next to Gerald.
Gerald
It wasn't suppose to be like this. I just thought it was funny making people get wild up. It was just stupid-harmless-lock-room humor, till I made that lady kill herself.
Dick
[sighs] You can't deny who you are, Skankhunt.
Gerald
[speaks softer and faces Dick] Don't call me that here! Why can't you just go away?!
Dick
Because we're all in danger. Didn't you see the video I sent you?
Gerald
No! Don't you get it?! I went "Protocol Zero"! I broke my phone, I delete all my email accounts so that nobody can trace me [faces away from the bench] ever again!
Dick
They will be able to, [faces Gerald] everyone. You need to see this video, Skankhunt. The whole world is about to change.
Sizzler. Kyle sits with Cartman and Heidi next to each other.
Cartman
[talks to Kyle] You want to know what's really going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Even though women have made great gains in the last century, there are still a part of men who aren't comfortable with women having power. It really just comes down to that, and then you have social media which allows men to anonymously say horrific things like "Women aren't funny," even though Heidi's like the funniest person I'be ever met.
Heidi
Shut up.
Cartman
[talks to Heidi] No, it's true. Get over yourself.
Kyle
[starts to get bored]
Heidi
I don't even try to be funny.
Cartman
I know. You don't have to 'cause you're awesome.
Kyle
Cartman, will you just help me mess with Butters to stop his little agroclub from getting any bigger?
Cartman
[talks to Kyle] Like mess with Butters how? [lifts mug] What do you mean "mess with Butters"? [drinks from mug]
Kyle
You know what I mean. Come on! We need the old Cartman back!
Cartman
[gets mad] Oh I see! You have a problem with Heidi.
Heidi
What?
Cartman
You're threatened by her because she actually has interesting things to say and she is funnier than you.
Kyle
That's not true at all!
Cartman
[talks sarcastically] Oh she's not funnier than you, [speaks with anger] or is she just not funny because she's a girl?
Heidi
Babe, stop. I don't think he meant anything by it.
Cartman
[talks to Heidi] Sorry, babe. It just really ruffles my feathers.
Heidi
[talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, I think it's great you're trying to patch things up with everyone, but the truth is Eric and I are just kind of out of it now.
Cartman
[talks to Kyle] Look, Kyle, we're just out of it now.
Heidi
We gave up social media and the ugliness that goes along with it and we're in a better place.
Cartman
Humans on Mars.
South Park park. Dick and Gerald are sitting together on a bench.
Dick
I'm warning you, Skankhunt, [takes out his laptop and types] this video is really gonna rock your world.
Gerald
[talks softer] Can you please call me "Gerald"?!
Dick
[gives Gerald his laptop] It's very obscure news story from the BBC in England. Hardly anyone has seen it over here. [presses a button and faces away from the bench] This is why we all have to come together, Skank.
Internet video is played.
BBC Reporter
Since the dawn of the Internet, message boards and chat rooms have lit up with people who insight and insult for no apparent reason. They're called [picture of guy with an actual troll behind him is shown] trolls, and a controversial company in Denmark is working to make them a thing of the pass. "The days of trolls hiding behind nicknames and message boards are over!" the Danish claim. [Danish music is played] As a new website, [Troll Trace headquarters is shown] Trolltrace.com will soon be up and running. In less than a month, the servers will become active. Anyone can take any troll comment and send it through the Danish service where a real name and real physical address will be attached.
Bedrager
[World spinning with the word "STIMULATION" is shown] Every message, every comment [comment is scan, world stops spinning, and a tracer is shown] ever made by trolls will retroactively be given a tag [troll's true identity is shown] with the author's name, location, and [police barge into the troll's house] whole Internet history.
Gerald
[in complete shock] Fffffuuuuuccckkk!
Dick
I told you.
Interview is shown
BBC Reporter
And this is the man who has masterminded it all.
Bedrager
What this will allow people to do is trace back harmful and hateful postings or emails. You see, the troll hides behind a protective layer if you will that Internet enmity provides. We intend to strip them of that protection so that everyone will know who they are.
Gerald wipes his forehead of sweat.
BBC Reporter
And what about people who will use this to spy on others who aren't trolls?
Bedrager
Uh, what do you mean?
BBC Reporter
Once your servers become active, anyone can trace anything onto the Internet back to whoever wrote it. How do you stop that from happening?
Bedrager
Oh oh, right. [coughs and faces the camera] This service is only for tracing the identity of trolls. Thank you. Kom ud trold, komme ud og dø.
The video ends.
Dick
I Google Translated the last part. He said "Come out troll, come out and die".
Gerald
This can't be happening.
Dick
By next week, everything everyone has ever done online is going to be available to the public.
Gerald
[closes laptop] Then it's over. I'm dead.
Dick
[faces Gerald] You're not dead, Skankhunt. There's still hope.
South Park Elementary cafeteria.
Kyle
[shouts] Everyone, can I have your attention please?! [everyone has his attention] I know the past few weeks have been very difficult, for all of us. I know now more than ever that something has to change. I thought a lot about this the past few days. I've seen a lot of things I never thought I would have see. These are all complex issues we're all having to face, and now that I know that after you break it down, there's really only one answer. [pulls off his pants, holds his shirt, and raises his arm]
The girls get upset]
Boys
Yeah! [one of them says "That's right." as they all gradually pull off their pants]
Butters
Good for you, Uncle Kyle!
Some of the girls leave while some of the boys lift Kyle up.
Secret room. Dick drags Gerald who is wearing a bandana over his eyes.
Dick
[takes off the bandana and crumples it in his shirt] Fellow trolls, let me introduce you to Skankhunt42.
Ten other trolls are seen in the meeting.
Gerald
I'm not necessarily Skankhunt42.
Troll #1
It's okay, Skank. You're with your kind.
Gerald is in shock and Dick closes the door of the room.
End of Wieners Out
 	
Douche and a Danish
South Park Elementary playground. The boys and girls are yelling at each other as Nelly and Butters are about to fight each other.
Jason
Hit her!
Random Boy
Hit her, man!
Annie
Kick his ass, Nelly!
Red
All boys should die!
Lola
Take him out!
Nelly
I don't care if you're a boy, I'm gonna kick your ass!
Butters
[is seen with his pants put down and shirt pulled up] Anytime anywhere, skank.
Boys (except Butters)
Yeah!
Boys (except Butters)
Yeah!
Nelly
Pull up your stupid pants first.
Butters
Why? You're afraid to fight me like a man?
Clyde
Kick her ass, Butters. She called you stupid.
Wendy
He is stupid! Look at him!
Jimmy
At least he's not a zzzzitty-faced ggirl.
Boys (expect Butters and Jimmy)
Yeah!
Cartman
[walks from the girls side of the fight to the in between Nelly and Butters and spreads his arms] Hey hey hey! Whoa, guys! Guys! [crowd stops yelling] Hasn't this gone on long enough? Aren't we tired of being so divided at skewl?
Annie
Get out of here, Cartman; nobody's buying it.
Red
Yeah, everyone knows you're the worst!
Heidi
Hey, leave him alone! [walks from the boys side of the fight to near Cartman] Eric tries to help [spreads her arms] and you call him names?! [talks to Cartman] Sorry, babe, I had to step in.
Cartman
It's cool, Baby.
[Heidi and Cartman kiss each other and causing the others to be flabbergasted]
Wendy
Heidi?!
Annie
[faints]
Cartman
Heidi has been really hurt by all of this, you guys. And I think it's time for us to all try to come together, as a skewl.
Presidential speech break room. Publicist speaks with Garrison.
Advisor #1
All right sir [gives Garrison his lines], don't be nervous for your speech; I know we're down a bit in the polls, but there's still a great chance we can win the Swing States.
Garrison
There's [flips through pages] still a chance, are you serious?!
Publicist #1
Just one thing sir, be a little careful of what you say about women. Uh, seems like that might be losing us some votes. [walks away]
Garrison
[puts his hand under his chin] Oh you don't say?
A campaign rally, later. "Make America Great Again." Chris Christie is at the podium]
Chris Christie
Ladies and gentlemen, out country's divided like never before. And we all know that only one man has the guts to say what we're all thinking. Please, welcome the man who with your help will soon be the next President of the United States! [Mr. Garrison comes out to great fanfare and takes the mic.]
Crowd Members
Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! Douche! [somewhere in there a man shrieks. Garrison lights up a cigarette and starts pacing]
Garrison
So I'm standin' in line at the airport, waitin' in security 'cause of all the freakin' Muslims. [cheers and applause]
Supporter
Ow!
Garrison
And the TSA security people all look like black thugs from the inner city; I'm like "Oh good, you're gonna protect us?" [laughter] Well maybe it's good they're all gang members. At least they can tell the difference between Muslims and Mexicans, 'cause God knows I can't. [applause] You know, I'm standin' there in line and you know what I do? I stick my finger in this chick's asshole, [applause and laughter] and she turns to me and says, "Hey, aren't you that guy that's running for President?" I say Yeah. She says "Why you got your finger in my ass?" I say "I'm just keeping it warm, honey, 'cause that chick next to you is way hotter and I'm gonna stick it in her clam." [the men are clapping, the women just look at him now] Yeah, let's make America great again. No dude wants his finger in some ugly bitch's ass. [the men laugh] You gotta be careful though, it's only about half an inch away, you know, that asshole and that clam, so you gotta be careful. Right dudes? [A woman gets up and makes her way to the aisle] Oh. Oh, where are you goin'? Are you leavin? [the woman turns right to leave the rally] I'm sorry, did I offend you? Where did I lose you, honey? You've been okay with the "fuck everyone to death," all the Muslim and Mexican shit, but fingers in the ass did it for ya? [she reaches the door and exits] Cool, just wanted to see where your line was! [some more women get up, one of them leaves with her husband] Oh yeah, look, I guess some more broads are leavin'. Oh Jeez you were so on board, I can't believe I let that little offensive mark slip. Poor girls. Did you get your feelings hurt after "Fuck all the immigrants" and?" Jeez, I'm sorry. Jeez.
[Trolltrace.com, day. A camera zooms into it. Lennart Bedrager dances into view.]
Bedrager
[in a weird accent] Hello. Are you tired of hate speech? Are you sick of sexism and-a bigotry? Then please, help the Danish put an end to trolls.
Danes
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
Bedrager
Right now, the people of Denmark are working on a biometric computer superstructure which will allow people all around the world to identify the trolls in their communities.
Danes
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
Bedrager
But to make this dream into a reality, we still need your donations. We are just a few million kroners away, so please donate via the social media of your choice.
Danes
[four windows open and some Danes sing out] Tjing tjang tjing nutillej.
Bedrager
Just imagine it, knowing who said what on the Internet.
Dane 1
The whole world will be-a peaceful and happy.
Dane 2
Like-a here, in Denmark.
Dane 3
Help fund our project on social media today!
Danes
Together, we will rid the world of trolls. Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang lu, Tjing tjang tjing nutillej!
[The darkened room from last episode. The trolls are gathered there again to plan their next move.]
Dick
Fellow trolls, we have gathered together because our anonymity is being threatened. Individually, we are some of the most notorious trolls in Colorado. We must now find a way to unite. Each one of us has the power to make message boards go haywire, The power to make individuals buckle and fall. Imagine if we use those skills against a common enemy.
Troll #2
They have an entire government at their disposal.
Dick
And we... have Skankhunt42.
Gerald
[sighs] It's Gerald. Alright?
Dick
I believe that he... is the key to stopping all this.
[South Park Elementary Gym, day. PC Principal is holding an assembly]
PC Principal
Alright everyone, listen up. This school is falling apart, and it needs to stop. Boys are harassing girls, and girls are stereotyping boys as- Not now, Mr. Stotch! Put it away!
Butters
[with his pants down and dick out] Well okay. [pulls his pants back up.]
PC Principal
Now I've asked for some ideas and a couple of students wanna try and help. Please welcome Heidi and Eric. [they come up wearing matching shirts: "COME TOGETHER as a school"]
Cartman
Hey you guys?
Heidi
What's up? [the other kids stay silent]
Cartman
Guys, we have a lot of problems facing our skewl. I don't know if many of you know Heidi but she's really smart and really funny.
Heidi
Eheh, stop, Eric.
Cartman
You are. And she's come up with a pretty cool idea. Tell 'em, baby.
Heidi
Thanks, babe. I don't know if you guys have heard, but right now, Denmark is trying to make trolling a thing of the past. They're asking for help, and I thought "why not a school fundraiser?"
Cartman
Yeah, but the way you said it was actually way funnier, remember?
Heidi
What? How did I say it? [from here their voices get softer and softer until they're whispering to each other]
Cartman
Remember, you were like "Oh, what if we had a fundraiser?" in uh, what was it? [they hold hands] Remember, you- it was like uh-
Heidi
When was this? Were we at Denny's?
Cartman
Yeah, we were having uhh, that dessert thing. What was that, that-?
Heidi
[giggling] Oh, and you kept spilling it and everything?
Cartman
Yeah, yeah, remember? Remember that there was that, that guy that had that, what was it
Heidi
He had that weird haircut and you kept saying that it looked like he had a dick on his head.
Cartman
Yeah yeah yeah, that's when you said that- don't let anybody- [they get lost in the moment for a few seconds whispering to each other. The other kids lean forward trying to understand what they're discussing. Cartman notices, then] Oh hey guys. Wha-what's up? Oh right. A school fundraiser. Tomorrow, we'll be going to each individual class with more information. And after that...
Heidi
Then we should all come together [mimicking Cartman] as a skewl. [Cartman giggles and sighs happily. Bebe throws up involuntarily]
[Campaign headquarters. Garrison's advisers are exasperated after his disastrous rally. Caitlyn is polishing her nails]
Advisor #1
Sir, what were you thinking? We said to be careful how you talked about women.
Garrison
[satisfied with himself] Yeah I don't know, I guess I just kind of screwed the pooch on that one. [checks for any Pabst Blue Ribbon cans with beer left in them]
Chris Christie
We are way down in the polls. I don't know how we recover from this.
Garrison
Oh really? Jeez that's too bad. [dusts off his pants and checks his shoes]
Chris Christie
A lot of us have staked our lives on backing you! You can't just go bonkers like this!
Garrison
Hey, sorry. I didn't realize women were racists.
Advisor 2
You have... millions of supporters who are looking to you to lead! They're gonna wanna know what you're gonna do about this!
Garrison
I mean, I don't know. Nothin'. Whatever.
Chris Christie
You wanna tell them that? They're outside. [Garrison is horrified.]
[Campaign headquarters, outside. a crowd of people wait to hear from Garrison. He cracks the door open and looks out]
Supporter 1
What's goin' on?!
Supporter 2
What are ya doin?!
Garrison
[steps outside] Oh, uh hey everybody. Uh, looks like we're tanking in the polls, but you know what? It's fixed. I was never gonna win in the first place. I knew it from the beginning. And on November 8th, when I lose, I'll be able to say "I told you so!" [grins. The crowd is not amused.]
Supporter 2
This son of a bitch pulled a fast one on us!
Supporter 3
It's like he's not even trying!
Garrison
Oh no, I'm I'm trying. I just-
Supporter 2
Get him!
Garrison
Shiiit! [he runs off, and the crowd gives chase] Ohhh Jeeez! [people in the crowd come armed with shovels, pitchforks, bats, axes, knives, guns... One person even has a chainsaw he has trouble starting up.]
Supporters
Kill him! Tear his head off! Don't let him get away!
Supporter 4
[ginally gets that chainsaw going] Yeah haw!
[The Airport Hilton. A concierge walks the hallways, humming to himself, and stops by a private conference: "Rape Victims Anonymous"]
Andrew
[knocks on the door]
Anonymous821
What do you want? Go away.
Andrew
Hey, just checking to see if you needed any more refreshments for the conference room?
Anyomous821
We're fine. We don't need anything.
A Troll
[within the room] Some more creamer?
Anonymous821
Just some more creamer.
Andrew
Alright, well, I just wanna say "thanks for choosing the-" [the troll shuts the door]
Anonymous821
Okay, we're clear again.
Dick
You were saying, Skankhunt?
Gerald
Alright, look. How do you troll somebody?
Troll 4
Say really fucked up shit and make them quit social media?
Gerald
No, no, no, it's not about one person. It's about pushing people's buttons so that they'll react in a way that pushes other people's buttons. Look, you don't just troll a woman with cancer to get a reaction from her, it's all about the group of people that are gonna come to her defense. They're gonna be so self-righteous that another group of people will eventually find those people totally annoying. You're just setting them against each other. It's like the fission reaction that sets off the fusion explosion. The Internet does it all, and you just sit back with your glass of wine and laugh.
Anonymous821
Wow... that seems kind of... mean.
Gerald
It's not mean if it's hilarious.
Dick
If we all worked with you, Skank, could we do it? Could we troll an entire country?
Gerald
If we all worked together? Maybe. [makes a fist with his left hand] Maybe.
[South Park Elementary, day. Mrs. Nelson has a lesson on mammals on the board, but Heidi is talking to the class about something else.]
Heidi
Hey guys. Today we're gonna start our school fundraiser. It's an idea I came up with called "Danishes for Denmark."
Cartman
[almost whispering] It's awesome. You're doing awesome.
Heidi
We need everyone to do their part, so later on in the cafeteria, we are all gonna need to- [the classroom door opens and Heidi looks to see who opened it. Mr. Garrison rushes in and gets to work immediately]
Garrison
[frantic] Okay children, let's take our seats! Let's uh, get back to our lessons on grammar, shall we?
Stan
Mr. Garrison?
Garrison
Okay, does anybody, uh, remember where we left off? No? Alright, uh, who can tell me what an adjective is? [to Mrs. Nelson] You can go now, I'm back. [to the class] Who can t-who can tell me what an adjective is?
Token
Uh, aren't you running for President?
Garrison
Adjectives usually come before what? They come before nouns, that's right.
Chris Christie
[clears his throat] Mr. Garrison, you can't just act like nothing happened! You're spiraling out of control, and you have to answer to the people!
Garrison
I don't know what you're talking about! I am a teacher! [back to the board] Okay, adjectives describe nouns, and there are several types of them-
Chris Christie
Mr. Garrison.
Garrison
What are some examples of adjectives you can give me for this sentence? Anybody? [writes "Jack threw the ball." on the board.]
Chris Christie
You sold people a line, Mr. Garrison, and you have to make good on it!
Garrison
The yellow ball. That's a good one. Or we can say "the slippery ball," can't we?
Chris Christie
Come on. [his advisers come in.]
Garrison
What else about the ball? No, please! [The advisers gather around him and carry him off] What else can we say about the ball, children? No, please! Leave me alone!
Butters
The bouncy ball?
Garrison
[grabs a chalk stick and scratches it against the blackboard] No! No, I'm not going back! Please! They're gonna kill me, children! Please! Help me, children! Help me! [Chris Christie shuts the door]
[The Broflovski house, day. Gerald and Dick arrive and go inside. They carry with them keyboards, computers, cables...]
Gerald
Okay, come on. Office is upstairs. [they run into Sheila] Oh, hi honey.
Sheila
Gerald, you're back from your convention?
Gerald
Yeah, it went really well. This is uh, my IT guy. Gonna help me get my office computers set back up.
Sheila
Well, can I make you guys somethin' to eat?
Gerald
Don't worry about us, hon. Lots of work to do. Love you so much! [he and Dick go on upstairs.] Ike, no Internet tonight. We need all the bandwidth we can get. Say hi to Dildo Shwaggins.
Dick
Hello. [Gerald closes the door]
[Gerald's home office. Gerald and Dick sit on the floor putting the computers back in place.]
Dick
I gotta hand it to you, Gerald. You have a really nice home, nice family.
Gerald
Yeah? Well now you see I have a lot to lose if they find out who I am.
Dick
And who is that?
Gerald
What?
Dick
I've studied your work. You're so good at lashing out at the system. Bringing people down off their high horses. Why do you do it?
Gerald
I told you, it's just funny to me. I do it for the lulz.
Dick
I don't believe that. I think there's more to Skankhunt. When I was in school, kids teased me. Called me "midget," even though I'm not. My mother was a little person, but she actually married a guy who had gigantism syndrome. She thought, if she was a little person and had a baby with a giant, I would come out normal. [Gerald stifles a laugh] We can't let these Danish pricks take our online lives, Skank. For some of us... it's all we have.
[The school cafeteria, day. A banner over the kitchen entrance reads "SCHOOL FUNDRAISER. LET'S ALL WORK TOGETHER." All the kids are making Danishes and PC Principal supervises it all.]
Heidi and Cartman
Let's come together as a skewl.
Cartman
We can work together hand in hand to make the whole world understand that
Heidi and Cartman
We came together as a skewl.
Cartman
Put our difference aside, feeling hope now feeling pride.
No more fighting, it's time for something new.

Heidi and Cartman
Let's come together as a skewl.
[During the song, the following things are seen: Two kids come up to get some trays with freshly backed Danishes on them, two other kids hand them the trays. Stan, Wendy, and Millie spread frosting on the Danishes. Butters and Nelly do the same at another table. Red passes by. Nichole and Token prepare the batter, as do Tweek and a girl. Clyde and Bebe pack the Danishes up and hand them to Nelly, then move on to the next box. By the time the song ends, the kids look tired. Annie, Kyle, Kevin, and another girl are putting frosting on their Danishes.]
Heidi
I really feel like this is the start of something new! We're gonna help Denmark, and Denmark is gonna put an end to trolls.
Cartman
And then maybe everyone can finally be as happy as we are.
Heidi and Cartman
Let's come together as a skewl.
Cartman
Terraform Mars.
[Shi Tpa Town, day. Mr. Garrison rans past City Wok]
Garrison
Oooooohhh. [stops to catch his breath, then sees his advisers and runs again] Oohh!
Adviser
He went this way!
Chris Christie
Get back here! You're acting like an idiot! [Behind the advisers is the crowd of supporters with their weapons]
Supporters
Get him! String him up! We put our faith in you, asshole!
[The trolls are in their own homes now.]
Dick
Test test 1 2. This is Dildo Shwaggins. We are ready to commence the trashing of Denmark. All trolls report in.

Alright, engaging Twitter... now! Prepare for overreaction on my mark. 3... 2... Mark.
[South Park, day. Sleet falls to the ground as the wind howls through town. Thunder rolls by. Garrison, dripping wet from the sleet, finds a door and steps inside - it's the South Park Community Center. He sees the members of Member Berries Anonymous seated around a circle, with an empty chair waiting for the random walk-in. Garrison's spray tan is washing off.]
Randy
Hey, Mr. Garrison. Come on in, bud. Have a seat, you're not alone.
Garrison
You, you're not gonna try and lynch me too?
Randy
No lynchings here, little cowboy. Take a seat. [Garrison takes the seat] You wanna share with us what you're goin' through?
Garrison
[crying softly] It's all my fault. I just wanted to get rid of all the immigrants, you know? [takes out a napkin and blows his nose with it] I just- I thought we could fuck them all to death, and everyone started listening to me. Next thing I know I actually get the nomination from the Republicans!
Randy
It's not your fault, little guy.
Garrison
It is my fault! I told people I could make the country great again, but I didn't have a plan!
Randy
Not your fault.
Garrison
I got caught up in people cheerin' for me, bein' in the media every day. I, I led this entire election down the shitter.
Randy
You've gotta stop blaming yourself.
Garrison
Well then, whose fault is it?!
Randy
Here, catch. [tosses a member berry at him]
Member Berry
Member Lando Calrissian? Member tauntauns? Member? Member feeling safe?
Garrison
What the fuck is this?
Randy
That... is why millions of Americans want you to be President. But there's more...
[The Broflovski house. Gerald is in bed, sleeping. Dick knocks on his bedroom door and Gerald wakes up. He checks for Sheila, but she's not in bed. He gets up to answer the door, and Dick shows him the latest headline: DENMARK IN TURMOIL!]
Dick
It's started! [smiles. Gerald smiles back, then grins.]
[The living room. Gerald and Dick run down to the sofa and take seats]
Gerald
Did they pick it up on Yahoo?
Dick
Don't know, but Google has it as the number one story.
Gerald
Oh, shit! Go to, go to Huffington!
Bill Keegan
Millions of people took to the Internet last night after shocking claims were made about the Danish company LEGO and their ties to ISIS.
Gerald
Oh yes! This is CNN front page right now.
CNN Anchor
It now appears the country of Denmark was the victim of a massive troll. The country is still reeling from the LEGO hoax story.
Bill Keegan
Tom, by the time the hoax was revealed the damage had already been done. Millions of people got on the anti-Denmark bandwagon, and when millions more came in to support Denmark, hundreds of millions more got on the anti-Denmark bandwagon.
Dick
We did it! We did it! [Kyle appears at the top of the stairs]
Gerald
Oh, Kyle! Ahh, hey, I didn't think you'd be leaving yet.
Kyle
I have a fundraiser at school.
Gerald
Well, did you see what was all over the Internet? Everyone's ripping on LEGOs.
Kyle
What?
Gerald
Yeah, now the whole world is blowing up with Danish jokes. It's hilarious.
Dick
The Guardian has a bunch of stories up about how the Denmark government isn't responding to even interview requests.
Gerald
Wow, fuck Denmark, huh Kyle? That's gotta be what just about everyone is thinking now. Fuck Denmark. [Dick grins]
[Trolltrace.com, day. Its executives run inside the building for an emergency meeting.]
Dane 2
Sir, public opinion of Denmark is-a very very shit.
Dane 3
All our social media pages are-a filled with million and millions of-a horrible comments.
Dane 4
And our crowd-funding sites are taken over too.
Dane 5
Everyone is making fun of us like we were goofballs.
Dane 6
How could-a this-a happen?
Lennart
Because that's what trolls DO! I should have known that once they got wind of our little plan, they would start trolling us!
Dane 7
So then Denmark isn't funding ISIS?
Lennart
Of course not!
Dane 1
But-a how do we prove that to the rest of-a the world?
Lennart
We can't respond, it will only make the trolls stronger! Our only choice is to go offline
Dane 5
You mean we have to quit Twitter?
Lennart
Everything, you ignoramus! The only way to stop the bleeding is for Denmark to get off social media! Pokkers Du Trold!
South Park Elementary, day. In front of the school, the kids have set up their Danishes for Denmark stand. Some of the kids are dressed in what appears to be Danish outfits]
Heidi
Hello. [a car rolls by] Buy a Danish to help stop trolling? How come nobody's stopping? Maybe this was a terrible idea.
Cartman
It was a great idea. [spots another car driving by] Hey! Hey, buy a Danish for Denmark?
Driver
Heheh, fuck Denmark
Butters
[runs up with his boxes and throws then down] That's it! I am through with your stupid crap! Every house I've been to just rips on me and and says Denmark is stupid!
Cartman
What?
Kyle
[arriving] It's true. Denmark got trolled last night. They left social media.
Heidi
Then, all of this was... for nothing.
Butters
I told you fellas! This is what you get for working with a bunch of stupid girls!
Wendy
How is this our fault?! At least we actually did the work!
Clyde
Oh yeah? You guys fucked up all the frosting!
Annie
You assholes overcooked them! [the kids begin to argue with each other]
Heidi
Oh no! This was a terrible idea! [leaves the booth]
Cartman
Heidi! [follows her]
[the side of the school, moments later. Heidi reaches a tree and sobs on it a little. Cartman catches up to her]
Heidi
I'm so stupid!
Cartman
Don't say that.
Heidi
Why did I even think I could bring the boys and girls together again?
Cartman
Because you're smart and funny, that's why. It was a great idea, Heidi. [puts his hand on her shoulder] I think that somehow... trolling is playing a bigger part in this than anyone even realizes.
[The member berry anonymous meeting. Mr. Garrison is still there]
Randy
Every great empire reaches a point where going backward can seem more appealing than forward. When the world is changing so fast it makes us yearn for the old ways, when life seemed simpler. But it doesn't mean those old ideas are good for us now. We have to face one hard reality as a country. [stands by an easel with a Star Wars poster on it] The new Star Wars was not as good as everyone thought it was. It may seem fun to go back and recycle the past we loved, but we end up with no sustenance.
Garrison
I thought you were gonna explain why people want a guy like me to be President.
Randy
Well, that's important too, I guess, but, it's just a symptom of the same thing. See, when a civilization has become so big it starts to get lazy, then that's [removes the Star Wars poster to reveal a picture of a member berry orchard] when you get member berries. They're noting new. They date back all the way to the Roman Empire. [shows a painting of a woman giving her lover some member berries.] Once too many Romans ate the member berries there was no more growth. They rested on their laurels just eating and 'membering all the good stuff.
Garrison
I think those are just grapes.
Randy
Thought so too till I zoomed in. [removes the painting to show a closeup of just the berries]
Member Berries
Member?
Randy
You see, we all wanna go back to when we were kids. Simple ideas like a big man to protect us, keep us safe. Instead of a fresh new Star Wars we want the old, just recycled and plopped in our tummies.
Garrison
You almost make it sound like J.J. Abrams is responsible for this entire election.
Randy
Does this look familiar? [removes the closeup to show J.J. Abrams wearing a cap on which is written "MAKE STAR WARS GREAT AGAIN."]
Garrison
[takes a good look at the picture, then stands up] Ohh Jeeez.
[Trolltrace.com. Lennart Bedrager sits in the conference room alone]
Dane 2
Sir! We got a message from overseas. You really should see it.
Lennart
A message how? We're completely offline.
Dane 2
This was sent on VHS. Whoever sent it is-a completely offline too.
Lennart
Put it on the screen. [a video pops up with Cartman and Heidi on it.]
Cartman
People of Denmark, we know that you've been the victim of trolling. So have we. Maybe we can help. I'm not sure if you know my girlfriend Heidi but... She's really smart and really funny.
Heidi
Stop baby, no I'm not.
Cartman
[whispers] You are, babe. Stop it.
Lennart
Who the hell are these people?
Dane 2
Just listen.
Cartman
[whispers] Go on, babe, just tell them. Tell them.
Heidi
I have an idea. I might be able to figure out the source of who trolled you last night.
Lennart
Get everyone back inside. If this girl really is that smart and funny, we might have another shot here. [the other Dane goes away]

M Burger. Cartman is smiling while on a date with Heidi.
Heidi
What are you thinking about, Babe?
Cartman
Just thinking about how much we could accomplish if... people weren't so close-minded.
Heidi
You're worried about him again, aren't you? Your friend, Kyle?
Cartman
[sighs] He's not a bad person, Heidi.
Heidi
Then talk to him babe. Tell him what we're doing. Maybe you can get him back.
Cartman
You're right. You're right, Heidi.
The Broflovski residence. Gerald is at his office trolling people.
Gerald
[repeatedly clicks on keyboard and talks softly] Ha ha, yeah. I'm yours, bitch. Ha ha. [speaks louder]. Suck it! [moves the mouse] How about a dick in your mouth?! There you go! Ha ha, ha ha ha ha. [notices the door bell ringing] Aw! [walks to the front door, and opens it]
Trolls
Hi Skankhunt!
Gerald
[gets shocked] Ah! [tries looking behind him] What are you guys doing here?!
Dick
We came to celebrate!
PurpleheadedQueeflicker
Not everyday you troll a whole country.
Anonymous821
[showed a case of John Adams beer] We brought some beer. Let's have a trolling party.
[The trolls have sat down and laughed each other]
PurpleheadedQueeflicker
We did it!
Dick
I think if anything, we proved that trolls really can have an effect on the world.
Trolls
Yeah! Yeah!
Troll 7
You said it!
SupersexyLisa18
Thanks to us!
Dick
And I think on the next one, [raises his beer] we're only gonna get better.
Troll 4
No doubt about it.
Gerald
Wh-what are you talking about "next one"?
Dick
Skankhunt, we got an entire country to sign off social media and... stop what they were doing. Imagine what effect we can have on the rest of the world?
Anonymous821
We're like super-trolls who could change anything.
Gerald
[leans to Dick] Can I talk to you for a second?
[Gerald and Dick walk to the kitchen]
Gerald
Why did you bring them here?!
Dick
What do you mean? We're all on a team, Skankhunt.
Gerald
That was a one-time deal so nobody would find out who we are!
Dick
But you saw what we did when we worked together? Just think what we could do to like the Presidential Election.
Gerald
The election?! I don't give a shit about the election! You don't troll to be political!
Dick
Of course it's political!
Gerald
No, I just do it to laugh, like I did when I was a kid! Don't you just remember being a kid and calling someone a fag for no reason?!
Dick
I remember being called a fag for no reason.
Gerald
Right! Like it was just fun, right?! Getting political doesn't do anything for me. I just like remembering when I was a kid. That's it. You need to get those people to go and then you need to go.
Dick
Okay. [puts down his beer mug] Sure, Skankhunt. Whatever you say. [walks away]
Marsh kitchen.
Garrison
Presidential election is only two weeks away. We have to [lifts a bag of memberberries talking] destroy these things.
Jar Berries
'Member the Bi-wing fighters? 'Member the Service Droids? I 'member.
Randy
[setting up experiment] That's much easier said than done. They're resistent to just about everything I tried.
Experiment Berry
'Member, 'member Mos Eisley? 'Member the Rancor, 'member? 'Member sand people? 'Member the Cantina? 'Member-- [gets torched by Randy and screams] My eyes!
Jar Berries
What's going on now? They're using a torch on him. Oh, are they gonna use a torch on us?!
Experiment Berry
Ah, Aaaaah! [stops getting torched] 'Member Bespin? 'Member Wedge? I loved Wedge. 'Member?
Randy
Uh, there has to be something.
Garrison
Try the acid.
Experiment Berry
'Member Mon Mothma? 'Member the rebel transports? [screams while acid is poured on him]
Jar Berries
They're trying to destroy us. They are?! Our whole species?! They can't do that?! Yeah they can! 'Member the Death Star blowing up Alderaan? Oo, Alderaan, I 'member.
Experiment Berry
[keeps on screaming until Randy runs out of acid] 'Member the Cloud City? 'Member IG-88, the bounty hunter droid? 'member, that was fanta'tic.
Randy
Damn it! [takes off flashlight] These things are impossible to get rid of.
Broflovski bathroom. Kyle sits on the toilet, using his phone and then hears a knock from the other side of the door]
Kyle
[tilts head up] Yeah.
Cartman
[opens the door halfway and leans] Hey, Broship. You got a minute?
Kyle
Oh, what do you want now?!
Cartman
Just a second. Please, Kyle?
Kyle
Hurry up!
Cartman
Okay, [walks with Heidi in the bathroom] come on, Baby.
Kyle
Ah! Dude, what the fuck?
Cartman
Kyle Kyle, I know you haven't had a serious girlfriend, but you've stop caring about seeing each other in the bathroom.
Kyle
I'm going to the bathroom!
Heidi
Eric really cares about you, Kyle. He feels like he's losing you and he's really upset.
Kyle
Why?
Cartman
[walks away from the toilet] I remember not that long ago, Kyle, when you told me in this very room I believe, that you were going to prove who the troll was no matter what. Do you remember that, Kyle? Where's that Kyle?
Kyle
[looks down] I have to stay with my group, Cartman.
Cartman
[walks to the sink] No no, I know. Being in groups is great; you get to gang [opens sink draw and grabs Lysol spray] up and smash people's stuff, pull up your wiener in the cafeteria. [sprays Lysol at Kyle and walks near Heidi] I wonder what the old Kyle say about this Kyle. I wonder if old Kyle would be pretty disgusted right now by who he's become. Heidi's been working with Denmark now, Kyle. I want to show you what she's done. It's gonna change the way you think.
Gerald's office. Gerald keeps on trolling.
Gerald
Ha ha ha. ha. You stupid bitch. God. Fuck you! Nobody cares about your fat, little-- [sees FaceTime call from Dick] Ah. Oh no, not again! [accepts his call] Yes?
Dick
Hey, Skankhunt, it's Dildo Shwaggins.
Gerald
I told you to stop FaceTiming me while I'm on the computer. It's very distracting.
Dick
Well you haven't been answering my calls, so I know this is the only way I can only talk to my buddy.
Gerald
I'm trying to just use the Internet! People should be able to use the Internet without being harassed.
Dick
[sighs] Oh, alright. Look, [grabs his guitar] I wrote a song about our friendship. Can I just play it for you?
Gerald
No!
Dick
[sings badly while strumming his guitar] Two lone wolves on the plains of darkness. The Valkyrie flies from the wailing clouds. The last of the--
Gerald
[ends the call] Bye! Jesus, what is wrong with people?! [drinks wine] Huh. [keeps typing] Nobody cares about your fat sister with Lyme Disease, skank.
Turner residence. Cartman, Heidi, and Kyle walk near Heidi's room. Heide blocks the door before they go in.
Heidi
[To Kyle.] This is gonna seem a little weird to you, okay?
Kyle
What is?
Heidi
Before I quit Twitter and threw my phone away, I was trying to prove who our school message board troll was.
Cartman
Like you said what you would do, Kyle, except she actually meant it.
Heidi
Before I stopped searching, I learned something. [opens her door] Take a look.
[Cartman, Heidi, and Kyle enter Heidi's room. Kyle walks closer to Heidi's wall to his shock]
Kyle
What is all this?
Heidi
To try and prove who the troll was, I started to for patterns in how students used emojis; then I crossed-referenced that with the troll's writing. I call it "emoji analysis". People can hide behind a fake name, but the way they use emojis gives them away.
Kyle
Wow, that's pretty smart.
Cartman
She's funny too, Kyle.
Heidi
After I had eliminated nearly every student, I have started to realize that the troll's emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kid's. That's when I realized it; whoever Skankhunt42 is on the school message boards, it isn't a student, it's an adult.
Kyle
You mean like one of the teachers?
Heidi
I think... it's one of the parents.
Kyle
Are you sure?
Heidi
I had enough examples of the teachers' texts and emails to do an emoji analysis, they were much more in lines with Skankhunt's, but still not a match.
Kyle
Emoji analysis, it's genius!
Cartman
You're not giving her credit for being hilarious.
Denmark. People are living their usual lives while some mourn at Freja Ollegard's grave. The setting moves to TrollTrace Headquarters.
Danes
[sing] En junker red ved juletid
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej Omkring ham dalet sneen hvid

Tjing tjang tjing nutillej Han stred sig frem i regn og blæst Med et der segnede hans hest Tjing tjang lu Tjing tjang lu Tjing tjang tjing nutillej [stop singing]

Dane 8
[runs towards Bedrager] Sir, take a look at the [shows Bedrager analysis] statistical analysis. The servers are working.
Bedrager
So then we don't need any more funding?
Dane 9
[walks to Bedrager] No, sir. Using Heidi's emoji analysis, we have the final piece of the puzzle.
Dane 5
So far we have narrowed down the location of the troll attack on Denmark. [walks to map of the U.S. with state of Colorado highlighted] It is a location in the middle of the United States: a place they call "Colorido".
Bedrager
Colorido? That's a very goofy name.
Dane 5
We believe that very soon the servers will give us the place in Colorido that the troll originated.
Bedrager
[walks closer to map] Hmm hmm. Go on and hide in your cave, little troll. Soon, everyone will know where you live.
Marsh kitchen. Randy gazes the berry with electricity while its in pain.
Randy
[stops putting in electricity] Damn it! [takes off flashlight] Nothing kills these things!
Garrison
We have to keep trying. [walks to the jar and grabs it] Where did they go?
Randy
They're not in the jar? [turns around] That's it. Look, it's over.
Garrison
No, I'll go find more. [leaves kitchen]
Randy
[follows Garrison] It's over! Don't you get it?! [walks closer to Garrison] Even if we've found a way to eradicate them now, we don't have time to implement it nation-wide.
Garrison
Then how do we stop them from getting me elected President?
Randy
[walks away from Garrison] There's no other choice, Mr. Garrison. [stops walking] The American people have to be made to understand what's going on here. [turns around] You're gonna have to talk to them.
Garrison
[raises his hands near his head] No, no! I am done giving political speeches: I've tried being dirty, I tried being vulgar. [spreads his arm a little] Nothing matters!
Randy
[walks closer to Garrison] For the first time ever, [stops walking] you're gonna have to speak from the heart: not make it about you.
Garrison
Well that's just impossible.
Randy
You know what these things are capable of. Even if you lose the election, another one like you is gonna rise up and take your place. J.J. Abrams is seeing to that.
Garrison
[lays his hand on his face] Don't you get it, Randy? I'm not a politician. I never was.
Randy
All I know is that for the future of our country, you're gonna have to give one last speech: the speech that everyone needs to hear, a speech where you finally just talk like a normal human being.
Garrison
Oooh geeeeez!
[Kyle's room, day. Kyle is at his desk working on math problems. His door is open and Cartman walks in.]
Cartman
Hey man, can we have a quick chin wiggle? Look, the other day when you said Heidi wasn't funny, that was pretty lame, man.
Kyle
She wasn't being funny.
Cartman
Oh my God, will you let it go?! Why do you have to have this hangup against women?!
Kyle
I don't!
Cartman
You do, Kyle! You have to think about the things you say! They matter! [turns to leave]
Kyle
Cartman, [leaves his chair] I did some research on the Danish Web site you've been helping out. You do realize that once TrollTrace is online, anybody can use it on anyone, right?
Cartman
Yeah, to catch trolls.
Kyle
So somebody, like Heidi, could use it to see your entire Internet history. Everything you ever said and did on the Internet, even before you were together.
Cartman
[a look of fear crosses his face] Well, Heidi doesn't actually use the Internet. We've sworn off that stuff, so it's kewl.
Kyle
Right, but somebody, like me, could look up your entire Internet history, print it out, and give it to Heidi. I would imagine there's some things you've done or said on the Internet you wouldn't want Heidi to know about.
Cartman
[thinks for a moment] ...Uh oh. [the recent past flashes through his mind, stopping off at the moment he saw Heidi's vagina in his room with the lights out, then moving on to the day he saw Ghostbusters]
[The Bijou, day. Cartman and his mom leave the theater]
Liane
Did you like the movie, hon?
Cartman
No, it sucked! I'm gonna send Butters an e-mail right now. [whips out his phone and types] "Dude, don't bother with new Ghostbusters. Totally not funny. Chicks ruined it." [puts the phone away] Can we get ice cream now? I wanna get the taste of ass out of my mouth. [fast forward to the present]
[Kyle's room, present day]
Cartman
How can they make what I said on the Internet available to the public? That's bullshit!
Kyle
It's available to everyone, stupid!
Cartman
I gotta go! [runs out]
[Randy's kitchen, night. The lights are out, only the moon shines in through the window above the sink.]
Unknown Memberberries
Heehee, hurry! Come on, we have to hurry! Let's go.
Memberberry 1
[rolls away from toaster] This way, this way! We have to go this way, 'member?
Memberberry 2
[bounces away from toaster] Oh, I 'member!
Memberberry 3
[rolls away from toaster] Come on, we have to hurry! [rolls while Berry 1 bounces]
Memberberry 4
[bounces away from toaster] 'Member Jabba the Hut? [bounces while following the others]
Memberberry 2
Yeah! Come on Tubbs, you have to keep up! 'Member?! [rolls while following the others]
Tubbs

Memberberry 1
Okay, almost there.
Memberberry 4

Memberberry 1
Shh.
Memberberry 4
[talks softer] 'Member the Battle of Endor?
Memberberry 3
[stops] Oh I 'member. [berries keep on moving].
Tubbs
Hehehe. Are we almost there?
Memberberry 1
Shh.
Memberberry 2
Come on, 'member?
Memberberry 4
Oh I 'member!
The Broflovski residence. Dick rings the doorbell and Gerald answers.
Dick
I miss my friend.
Gerald
Oh you got to be--Are you joking?!
Dick
I don't know how things got derailed but, I-I'm sorry if I made you upset. I want to be buddies again.
Gerald
Buddies like when? When were we buddies?
Dick
Come on, let's just have a couple of beers and do some trolling.
Gerald
I don't have time for you! I'm sorry, dude, but I have a life. I have a wife, and kids, [raises his arms] and shit to do!
Dick
Why are you mad at me'?
Gerald
Because you won't go away and let me just have fun!
Dick
I refuse to believe that Skankhunt is that shallow.
Gerald
[turns to his side] Oh here we go!
Dick
When you Photoshopped penises in Kesha survivors' mouths, it's not just to make people laugh.
Gerald
[faces Dick] Yes it is!
Dick
If someone Photoshopped a dick in your wife's mouth, would you just think it was funny?
Gerald
You mean my [shows his phone to Dick with image of Sheila Photoshopped] fucking screensaver.
Dick
It's true. You're just an asshole. I thought you were the ultimate rebel. I actually looked up to you and you're nothing but a super... dick.
Gerald
And what are [points at Dick] you, Dildo Shwaggins? Huh? You think you're a fucking political activist hauled up in your shitty little midget condo. You're nothing but a pissed off little giant, lashing out at everyone because you can't get laid!
Dick
At least I have a reason to be angry. What do you have, that it's funny? Hurting people is just worth the laughs?
Gerald
Stop trolling me.
Dick
One day you're gonna wake up and realize that you don't have anyone either.
Gerald
Stop fucking trolling me. [shuts the front door]
TrollTrace Headquarters. Dane 2 walks to Bedrager while singers sings "Tjing Tjang Tjing".
Danes
Den jomfru sad i høje torn
Tjing tjang tjing nutillej Og vendte ham som til forn Tjing tjang tjing nutillej

Dane 2
We have it! We think we have it! [stops walking] The emoji analysis worked. We've found the IP address of the troll that trolled us.
Bedrager
[turns around] Triangulate the servers.
[servers triangulated an area on North Colorado]
Bedrager
Focus everything on that area. It's time to see what these puppies can do.
Fort Collins, Colorado, MLKKK's house. MLKKK types at his computer and hears an air-raid siren and then turns on the TV.
News Reporter
Once again, if you live in the city of Fort Collins, there is a chance that all your emails and your entire Internet history has been made accessible to the public.
MLKKK
[checks his neighbor who is seen running out of the house screaming]
Fort Collins Citizen 1
[exits the house] Who the fuck are these emails to, and what the, what the fuck is MarriedButHorny.com?! [throws the Mac at her husband]
MLKKK
[sees his phone and picks it up with caution] Hello?
Unknown Caller
I know where you live now you son-a bitch.
MLKKK
[throws his phone on his desk and runs away to his car where he drives]
Fort Collins Citizen 2
I've been hacked! Help me I've been hacked!
Everyone in Fort Collins is panicking.
Fort Collins Citizen 3
They'll never forgive me! [jumps down from a high building]
MLKKK
[quickly presses the brake pedal, but crashes to the car in front of him. He leaves his car behind]
Fort Collins Citizen 4
[gets out of her car] They know everything I said about them! The club knows--
MLKKK
[pushes the woman] Get away from me! [runs away, but then gets stopped]
Unknown Caller
Hello MLKKK! You called my daughter "R2-D2". You know how long I waited this day, you son-a bitch! [throws a gasoline and lights a match on MLKKK, causing him to burn in pain]
Unknown Caller's Daughter
Is he burning, Pa?!
Unknown Caller
He's burning bright, little girl.
A highway. A toy car is driven with a few Memberries on them. The berries talked while the song "Africa" is played.

Memberberry 1
Hey you, shut the fuck up!
Memberberry 2
Yeah, we're gonna kill you, 'member?
Mickey
Oh, I 'member. [trunk gets shut]
The Memberberries dance and talk while "Africa" is playing.

Gerald's work office. Gerald watches a news report on his computer.
News reporter
Complete panic and mass-hysteria tonight as the City of Fort Collins has been hacked.
Gerald
Oh my god. Oh my god, they've done it.
News reporter
The Danish are taking complete credit for the cyber-attack, blaming its successfully exposed and notorious troll. [MLKKK's picture and identity is shown] The man has been identified as the Internet troll MLKKK, and was burned alive by one of his apparent victims.
Gerald
Ah!
News reporter
The Danish claimed this was only a beta-test and soon the servers will be available worldwide. [turns his head to his left] Wait, so like they'll be releasing everyone's Internet history? Uh, I gotta go. [runs away]
Gerald
No! No no no no no! [FaceTimes Dick] Dildo, they done it! The Danish figured out how to hack everyone's Internet history!
Dick
[ends the call]
Gerald
Ahhh!
Mars in Cartman's fantasy. There's a severe dust storm.
Cartman
Not kewl! Not kewl! [holds onto a rock and sees someone caught in the storm, flying away] Not kewl! [tries to walk to the station]
Unnamed character 3
[holds onto a station] Wait!
Unnamed character 1
Have fun! [gets blown away by storm]
[roler coaster gets damaged]
Cartman
It's all falling apart! Weak!
Cartman's room. Heidi notices Cartman is worried.
Heidi
What is it, Eric? What's wrong?
Cartman
I-I, I don't know.
Heidi
Come on. We don't keep secrets, remember?
Cartman
It's just hard.
Heidi
You said you wanted to be perfectly honest with me, always.
Cartman
And I do. [breathes heavily] This one time, [wipes his nose] I think it was over the summer I went to see the new Ghostbusters movie.
Heidi
Yeah.
Cartman
And, and during the movie I was like "Wait, where is my phone?" and I couldn't find it; and then Jimmy said "Ha ha ha, screw you, Cartman," and he was holding my phone and he ran off with it and said, "I gonna send a bunch of texts and emails from your phone so that everyone thinks it's from you,"; and I was like "No, that's not cool!" and he said "Yeah," and he said a bunch of mean stuff before I went to go get him and I took my phone back; and I'm just worried th-that people look at my Internet history, they're gonna think all that stuff came from me!
Heidi
Well I'm glad you told me, 'cause now I know.
Cartman
So you totally believe me?
Heidi
Of course. [Cartman and her touch hands] You've never given me a reason not to believe you, babe.
Cartman (fantasy)
[sees Mars restored] Kewl! [leaps]
Heidi
You have no reason to worry. People will know it wasn't you. With emoji analysis, everyone will be able to tell exactly where any comments came from.
Cartman (fantasy)
[holds onto a rock, noticing a severe dust storm] Ugh! No, [lets go of the rock] nooo!
A campaign. Mr. Garrison gives a speech.
Garrison
My fellow Americans, we live in an un-presented time of uncertainty. I want to speak to you human-to-human because with God's grace, this will be the last time you ever hear from me. When I started this campaign I was saying a lot of shit because I was angry, [Gerald is seen in a bar, worried] and then I turned that anger into pushing buttons by more and more outrageous. Slowly, people started paying attention to me and I guess it made me feel powerful. Well now the chickens have come home to roost. [Kyle, Ike, and Sheila are seen having dinner in their home] Sooner or later, we all get exposed. [Gerald sees his family having dinner] We're all held accountable for what we say, what we do. [Garrison is seen again] There is only one thing that matters now. On November eighth, you must vote against me, and show the world that you didn't think the new Star Wars was all that good. When you're in that voting booth, remember that every vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote that shows the world we agree that The Force Awakens was more like a happy day reunion's special than a movie. The choice is yours, America. Please make the right one.
Clinton's office. Two FBI agents enter.
FBI agent 1
The Danish claim they will soon have the ablity to publish anyone's Internet history. We have to act fast, Mrs. Sandwich.
Clinton
I'll have you treat me with more respect. Haven't you seen the polls? It's president elects Sandwich.
FBI agent 1
We may not want to get too far ahead ourselves. [takes out a file of Skankhunt42 from envelope] TrollTrace must be stopped. [gives file to Clinton]
Clinton
Who is Skankhunt42?
FBI agent 1
We believe he's the only one who can save you now.
A restaurant. The memberberries are together.
Memberberry 1
Here we are. We made it.
Tubbs
We did?
Memberberry 2
Yeah, we have to go with Plan B, 'member?
Memberberry 3
Ooh, I 'member.
Memberberry 4
[talks to Hostage Berry] Sorry asshole, end of the line for you.
Mickey
That's okay, I 'member. [gets pushed into a drink]
Waiter
[grabs the drink and brings it to a table] Here you are, ma'am, gin and tonic.
Caitlyn
[grabs drink] Thanks.
Waiter
Should be an interesting election this year, huh?
Caitlyn
[takes a sip] Buckle up, buckaroos.
End of Fort Collins

Oh, Jeez
South Park Community Center, night. The 2016 Presidential Election Night Viewing Party is over. Hillary's campaign poster is seen on an exterior wall. One man is passed out on the lawn off to the right with a bottle of beer nearby, another man throws up after walking out the doors. Most everyone there is either tired or disappointed. Inside, there are a few more people watching the results
Bill Keegan
And uh, definitely a bit of a surprise here. Looks like America has voted for a change of pace. The world is in a bit of a shock, uh... Is this? We're, we're for sure this is for real, right?
Randy
What have you done?! You maniacs! [a man seated near the entrance pulls a gun out his back pocket and shoots himself in the head, falling off the chair.]
Bill Keegan
We uh... I guess we're going live to the acceptance speech now? Uhh okay, here we go.
President Elect Douche
[with Caitlyn beside him] The people have spoken. Just as J.J. Abrams did with Star Wars, I will make this country great again.
Randy
This isn't how it was supposed to happen.
President Elect Douche
All my efforts this past week have paid off. And now, let's begin... fucking them all to death!
Butters' house, day. Cartman is at his front door knocking. Butters answers it
Cartman
Hey hey Butters, can I talk to you?
Butters
What do you want?!
Cartman
[walks in] Do you remember an e-mail I sent to you a few months ago, after I saw the new Ghostbusters movie? In which I might have said something to the effect of it totally sucking balls because women aren't funny?
Butters
Well I don't know, Eric.
Cartman
I just need to see exactly what I e-mailed you, Butters. And then I need you to e-mail me saying what an awesome prank that was e-mailing you "Ghostbusters sucked balls" when actually I told you it was really funny several times in person.
Butters
NO! I'm not doing anything for you! You're a traitor!
Cartman
A traitor?
Butters
Yeah! Boys and girls were at war, but you go and kiss your little girlfriend's ass! Whatever happened to sticking with your kind?!
Cartman
Sticking with my kind? You guys broke all my stuff!
Butters
Because girls drove us to break all your stuff, dumbass! If anyone should be pissed at chicks, it should be you! But no, you got your bitchy little girlfriend pullin' your strings now!
Cartman
Please do not call her that, Butters. I really like her.
Butters
Oh God, listen to you! [mimics his last sentence] "Please don't call her that I really like her." You've changed, Eric! You've really changed! Now get the fuck out of my house! [Cartman is taken back, but closes his mouth and walks out the door. Butters slams it closed behind him]
Channel 9 News. A reporter stands near some scaffolding around a newly-walled city
Tom
A historic election, and all the votes are in. Except of course in the city of Fort Collins, Colorado. It's been several days now since Fort Collins was hacked. Everyone's e-mails and Internet history became accessible to the public after being targeted by the Danish Trolltrace program. According to our eye in the sky, their votes will not be tallied anytime soon.
Eye in the sky
It's complete bedlam inside the city limits, Chris. [traffic accidents at every intersection, a broken fire hydrant spewing a geyser of water, three giraffes running through the streets...] Since the city was hacked there have been murder, suicide, and complete lack of civility. We also understand that nearly everyone within Fort Collins who was married is now divorced. Back to you, Tom.
Tom
This barricade behind me was put up not only to make sure nobody goes into Fort Collins, but also to make sure nobody gets out, since there's no telling whose Internet histories they've seen
Dangling Man
[at the top of the barricade] Please! [Tom glances at him and the camera zooms in] My wife is so pissed at me! [a bullet strikes him from the air and he falls to his death several stories down.] Guh!
Tom
[faces the camera] The defiant Danish company is still declaring Trolltrace a success, and claims that it will be available worldwide at any moment.
South Park, night. A helicopter flies over the kids' neighborhood and a camera on the chopper scans the area. A night sun comes on and focuses on a house. It's Gerald's house - he looks out a living room window and panics
Gerald
Oh God... [he looks up at the sky and sees the helicopter] Oh God! [he goes outside for a better look. Two government vehicles pull up right away and agents pour out of them]
Lead Agent
We have him. The subject is home. [Gerald looks around, then runs inside and closes the door]
Inside the Broflovski house. Gerald runs past the stairs as Kyle and Ike come down to see what's going on.
Kyle
Dad, what the?
Ike
What's goin' on, Dad? [Sheila comes out of the kitchen]
Gerald
[runs up to her] They're coming for me, Sheila! They know everything!
Sheila
About what??
Gerald
Everything I did online! It's over!
Lead Agent
Sir, if you'll come with us?
Agent 2
We need to speak with you?
Sheila
[shields him] You people really have nothing better to do?! What he did online is his business! Or maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the one that likes being peed on and I sucked him into it. Did you know that urine is 100% sterile?! How dare you burst into our home! [a shot of Ike and Kyle looking confused]
Gerald
Sheila!
Sheila
Urologia has been around since the time of the Greeks!
Agent 2
Sir. Please come with us now. [Gerald walks towards them]
Sheila
Gerald, you don't have to listen to them.
Gerald
I'm sorry, Sheila. Please know that I love you so much. Goodbye Kyle, Ike. [all three look on helplessly]
Neighborhood park, night, the bench. Heidi and Cartman are there again. They're wearing Beauty and Beast shirts, respectively. Cartman looks helpless
Heidi
I can't believe it, babe. I really didn't think things would end up like this.
Cartman
Yeah. Neither did I.
Heidi
I just... feel so disconnected from the world, you know? I really thought this was gonna be the moment that proved girls could do anything, like you always say.
Cartman
You can't stop believing that. Now more than ever you have to stay strong.
Heidi
I'm just glad I have you. At least I know you believe girls are smart.
Cartman
You are smart, Heidi.
Heidi
And funny too, right? You're always saying how people need to get over that girls are funny.
Cartman
[getting emotional] You're funny. Oh my God, when Amy Schumer talks about her vagina I seriously lose my shit.
Heidi
Hey, are you okay? This election really got to you too, huh?
Cartman
Yes, Heidi. For the first time I'm really scared for the future.
Heidi
Me too, babe. [scoots in and rests her head on his shoulder] Me too.
Freemont Bridge, night. One of the government vehicles stops at one end of it and the agents take Gerald out of it.
Gerald
Where are you taking me? [the agents take him down the riverbank to the riverbed] Wait! Please, there's been a mistake! Someone set me up! I'm not Skankhunt42! [the agents take him to a shadowy figure under the bridge] Dildo?
Hillary Clinton
[comes out of the shadows] Hello. Mr. Cunt.
Gerald
Turd Sandwich... I don't understand.
Hillary Clinton
Things... have not turned out the way they were supposed to. This election was stolen. And while this government is still in power, we have to prove it. We've come to ask for your help.
Gerald
My help?
Hillary Clinton
Leave us. [the agents leave and head up the riverbank] As I understand, there's quite a lot you've done online you don't wanna have come out. But I also understand you weren't trying to get a woman to kill herself. You were just being funny.
Gerald
Exactly!
Hillary Clinton
The Trolltrace program is the most sophisticated of its kind. The government has only a few short weeks to try and use that technology to stop the President-elect from taking office.
Gerald
What do you want me to do?
Hillary Clinton
You've proven one thing: that you have the ability to pretend to be someone you're not. We wanna send someone into Denmark undercover and steal their technology.
Gerald
You mean like... like James Bond? [looking hopeful]
Hillary Clinton
Totally like James Bond. You and I need each other, Skank. What do you say?
Mr. Garrison's house. Randy knocks on the front door repeatedly
Randy
Garrison! Garrison, what the fuck have you done?! [Caitlyn answers the door] Where is he?!
Caitlyn
He's resting. He's had a busy week.
Randy
[goes inside] Yeah I'll say he has! [sees him on the sofa and walks up to him] Do you have any idea what you've done to our country?!
Garrison
Yeah. Fuck them all.
Randy
You admitted you didn't know how to run a country! You agree people were supporting you just because they like the new Star Wars, and you begged me to help you lose!
Garrison
I changed my mind. The new Star Wars was actually really good.
Randy
No it wasn't!! Something else has to have happened!!
Caitlyn
Maybe some people enjoy nostalgia and going back to what feels comfortable.
Randy
There's nothing great about rehashing all the old Star Wars moments into a new- [Caitlyn vomits out a gusher of member berry juice.] Ah! Aaah! Aaaaaah! [bits of member berries are on Randy's face] Aaah. [member berry voices are heard] I, I suppose... I suppose I can watch it one more time. Give it another chance.
Turd Sandwich's office
Agent 2
[hands him a dossier] You're flying to Denmark under the guise of being a foreign ambassador. The Danish think you want to help them. Here's your fake passport and here are your nifty camera glasses. [the lead agent hands those over to Gerald]
Gerald
Wow...
Agent 3
Once inside the Trolltrace building, you will plant this. [the fourth agent walks forward with a briefcase] Looks like an ordinary briefcase, but at exactly 9:30 Danish standard time. the case will open, detonating an EMP device that will take out their entire facility.
Agent 2
It'll fry all their equipment, servers, and backup computers. After it detonates we'll be on the roof to pick you up.
Gerald
[smiles] And then everything can go back to normal.
Lead Agent
One last thing: to pass yourself off as the ambassador, you have to pretend to be from the Turkish Islands. Are you any good at... changing your voice?
Gerald
That depends. Are you asking me? Or are you asking... [does his first impersonation] me, Andy the drunk sheriff? *hic* [next impersonation] Or me, the old Irish dart player? [third impersonation - Peter Griffin] Or me, from Family Guy? [fourth impersonation - Stewie Griffin] Or me, from Family Guy? [fifth impersonation - Chris Griffin] Or me, from Family Guy? [The lead agent and Agent 2 give him thumbs up]
Ike's room, day. Ike is playing Minecraft when he gets a FaceTime call - it's his father.
Gerald
Hi Ike, it's Daddy. Everything OK there? [Ike look around] Listen, buddy, you remember how we talked about trolling and just between us guys we agreed it was pretty funny? [Kyle walks by Ike's room, hears Gerald's voice and stops to look inside] Well it turns out that even the-
Kyle
Dad! [runs into Ike's room] Where are you?
Gerald
Oh, hey Kyle.
Kyle
Dad, what's going on? Mom is freaking out.
Gerald
Tell your mom everything's fine, okay? I'm helping out the government. It's top-secret stuff, but everything's finally gonna be okay.
Kyle
No, Dad, I need you back home. Please, I-I'm so confused right now.
Gerald
Kyle, you've gotta lighten the fuck up, buddy. Every day with you it's "Dad, I feel guilty about this. Dad, I'm so confused about that." You're a kid. You're supposed to just laugh and make fun of shit. [smiles] Stop being such a pussy, okay pal? Fuck. [hangs up, leaving Kyle a bit stunned]
Ike
Daddy called you a pussy.
South Park Elementary gymnasium. PC Principal stands before a big screen with speakers on either side
PC Principal
Alright everyone, listen up. I know that many of us were shocked to the core with last night's election. But we cannot allow our school to be any further divided. It is time to try and start the healing process, and so here, to try and help us heal, is Bill Clinton. [claps. He's the only one to do so. Bill Clinton steps out from behind the screen]
Bill Clinton
Hi kids. I'm Bill Clinton, and I was almost the first gentleman in America. Thank you. Even though we might have lost the election, it doesn't mean that my work to be a gentleman is goin' to stop. I'm gonna ask all you boys to agree to join Bill Clinton's Gentleman Club. [its logo shows up on screen] But I can't do it alone. Sometimes, I wish there were two of me. Oh wait, there are. Oh Bill!
Bill Cosby
Yes, Bill?
Bill Clinton
Come on out here.
Bill Cosby
Hello, boys and girls.
Bill Clinton
I'm Bill
Bill Cosby
And I'm Bill
Bill & Bill
And together we're Bill and Bill
Two birds of a feather comin' to your school Gonna show you all about what gentlemen do. When you're not quite sure how you feel Ask Bill and Bill.

Bill Clinton
Say, Bill?
Bill Cosby
Yes, Bill?
Bill Clinton
Would you like to join my gentlemen's club?
Bill Cosby
You know I would, Bill.
Heidi's room, day. She's writing some stuff down when Cartman enters her room.
Cartman
Heidi? Heidi!
Heidi
Hey babe. What's the matter?
Cartman
Sorry, I have to talk to you. It's really important.
Heidi
Okay.
Cartman
Heidi, we... have to get to Mars.
Heidi
I know, babe. You've talked about how humankind needs to get to Mars for a few weeks now.
Cartman
No, Heidi, we have to get to Mars like, now. [walks around a bit] I've seen what's gonna happen when Trolltrace goes online. I think... a lot of people have said and done things online that will make a lot of other people angry and, it's going to be very bad. Humankind is going to destroy itself and its only hope are the people who go to Mars, where there's no wifi. So nobody can see what anybody said or did on the Internet, ever.
Heidi
Babe, there's no way to get to Mars right now.
Cartman
Yes. [walks up to hold her hand] Heidi, I think there is. But you have to totally trust me, and know that I'm doing this to save... us.
Heidi
I trust you with everything I have.
Cartman
That's kewl.
Copenhagen, day. "Tjing Tjang Tjing" plays. The arrivals area is shown, and Gerald descends on an escalator. The music switches to an action-paced score.
Ticket Agent
Your name, please?
Gerald
Miller. Von Miller. [adjusts his cuff links] I'm the ambassador of technology from the Turkish Islands.
Ticket Agent
Oh yes of course, Ambassador Miller. You're here to support our country's-a Trolltrace program, yes?
Gerald
That's right.
Ticket Agent
Your escort is-a right over there. [points to her left. Dane 5 waits at the exit holding a welcome sign up: "AMBASSADOR VON MILLER"]
A Trolltrace vehicle. Dane 2 is driving, Dane 5 is in the passenger seat, and Gerald is in the back seat.
Gerald
Nice little country you have here. Really clean.
Dane 5
Yes, ambassador. Denmark is ranked the nicest place to live in all the world almost every year. [the car stops at the Trolltrace entrance and the occupants step out] This is it, ambassador. All of Trolltrace is housed in this building.
Gerald
Mhm. [takes a picture. They go inside and Gerald looks around the lobby] Wow, this is really impressive. [takes a few more pictures]
Lennart Bedrager
[appears] Thank you for coming. [Gerald turns around] Welcome to Trolltrace. I cannot tell you how much I've been looking forward to your visit, [somewhat ominously] Ambassador Von Miller. We have so much to talk about. Won't you join me upstairs for frikadellers and leverpostejs?
A table at a restaurant. Stan is in a chair.
Stan
I can't imagine how you're feeling right now. I know that the election didn't go the way you'd hoped. What I want to say is, I'm sorry. [Wendy is shown facing him across the table] I know that girls have gone through a lot lately, and I just want you to know that... I'm here for you.
Bill Clinton
Okay, okay, that's good, but now, make sure she knows how you're gonna change.
Stan
I am gonna change. I, I am.
Bill Clinton
Whether she takes you back or not.
Stan
Yeah well, but I, but I want her to take me back.
Bill Cosby
[pops into view as he leans back on his chair] Yeah, but if you're just changin' to get her back, then you're bein' selfish again.
Stan
Okay, look. The bottom line is, you still have to have faith... in boys, because... because I miss you, Wendy. [some knocking nearby. Stan and Wendy look in the direction of the knocking]
Butters
Traitor! [Stan, Wendy, and Bill Clinton see him outside with four other boys - Craig, Clyde, Tweek, and Francis] Fuck you, Stan! You're a traitor! [drops his pants to show his wiener and puts his fist high up in the air]
Stan
Go away Butters! [Cosby leans back to see what's going on]
Bill Clinton
Who's that?
Butters
How dare you be ashamed of who you are?! [steps forward and presses his wiener onto the window]
Bill Cosby
Oh, he's pressin' pickle!
Trolltrace building, boardroom. Gerald and Lennart enjoy a meal, surrounded by servers outside the room.
Lennart
Enjoying the frikadellers?
Gerald
Oh. Yes, they're nice.
Lennart
And the leverpostejs are seasoned to your liking?
Gerald
Ah, I wouldn't know. Ha, haha.
Lennart
You keep-a checking your watch, Ambassador Von Miller. Are you late for something?
Gerald
No, no I, I-I'm just anxious to get a look at your servers. They must be quite impressive.
Lennart
Yes. Well a database that can identify everybody's Internet activity is-a very complex. I'm so pleased you want to help us rid the world of-a trolls. Do you happen to recognize... [clicks on a remote controller and a black and white picture of Freja Ollegard appears onscreen] this woman?
Gerald
Ahhh... no.
Lennart
Her name was-a Freja Ollegard. She was Denmark's-a national treasure. [pours himself some Gold Top wine] She had an amazing breast-cancer awareness website, and some... troll... decided to Photoshop-a wieners in her mouth. [Gerald stifles a laugh by putting a napkin over his mouth]
Gerald
Oh, wow. That's terrible.
Lennart
Her final straw was when she was trolled on a live TV show. [pours some more wine into a second glass] When the troll posted comments about-a breast cancer with-a fake doctors' names. Would you like to know what the doctors' names were? The first one was a Dr. Boobsoff. Dr. Cootsier Boobsoff. [Gerald stifles a second laugh] Then I believe there was a Dr. Juerdior Titsgo. [Gerald stifles a third laugh] But probably most insensitive of all was when the troll said he was Dr. Ipples. Dr. Now I'm Only-n Ipples. [Gerald stifles a fourth laugh, but it's getting harder and harder to do so. Lennart notices and gets in his face] Are you alright, Von Miller?!
Gerald
I'm fine. I... I think the frikadellers gave me a little heartburn. Ah, if you wouldn't mind, could I see the servers now?
Lennart
It would be my pleasure.
The Stotch house, night. The doorbell rings and Stephen answers it.
Bill Clinton
Hello, I'm Bill Clinton, and I was almost the First Gentleman in America.
Stephen
Oh my gosh! Honey, it's the nearly-Gentleman!
Bill Clinton
May I come into your lovely home?
Stephen
Well of course, that's very gentlemanly of you. [Clinton enters]
Linda
Oh my goodness, it's him. Hello, sir.
Bill Clinton
Hello, ma'am. I wasn't expecting someone so stunning. [takes her right hand and kisses it] I'm so sorry for the intrusion, but I was wondering if I could speak with your son.
Stephen
Oh. Well, I'm afraid Butters is grounded for pressing pickle at the nail salon again.
Linda
Stephen, this is a guest, a gentleman.
Stephen
Uh but, but of course we'll make an exception. [takes Clinton upstairs and to Butters' door] Butters has been grounded quite a lot lately. Don't know what's gotten into him. [unlocks the seven locks and latches used to keep Butters in his room]
Bill Clinton
Well, maybe I can help.
Stephen
That'd be great. No matter how hard we ground him, he remains defiant. [finally opens the bedroom door. Butters is standing on his bed looking out the window, with his wiener out] Butters, stop smooshing snake! The gentleman is here to speak with you.
Butters
[over his shoulder] What?
Bill Clinton
Hello, young man. Come on, sit down. Let's talk.
The Marsh house, dinner time. The family is eating dinner, but Stan is missing and Randy is still under the influence of member berry juice.
Randy
Well, I don't know about you guys, but I sure am excited. America is going to be great again. Aren't you excited, gang?
Shelly
No I'm not excited! It sucks, Dad! This country is gonna suck for four years!
Randy
Aww, come on, Shelly. We've learned that women can be anything. Except for President.
Sharon
Randy! You just spent the last month convincing me that the only reason people wanted to go back was because of a childish nostalgia they all had for the new Star Wars!
Randy
Have you really watched it, Sharon? It has more to offer than just nostalgia. Let's all watch it again tonight.
Sharon
What?! I don't wanna watch Star Wars any more than I- [Randy vomits member berry juice on her]
Shelly
Dad, what the hell is wrong with y- [Randy vomits member berry juice on her]
Trolltrace headquarters, day. Lennart Bedrager opens the server vault.
Lennart
Please, ambassador, explore the servers at your leisure. Let us know if you have any questions.
Gerald
Thank you. [the Danes leave, and Gerald goes into spy mode, entering the vault and locking it. He takes pictures every few steps and passes by Dick unaware]
Dick
You can stop being an idiot now.
Gerald
[notices him] What the-? Dildo?
Dick
Skankhunt.
Gerald
What the fuck are you doing here?
Dick
I was sent here by the government to do international espionage like James Bond.
Gerald
Nononononono, that's what I'm doing. Hillary Clinton says I was the only one capable of-
Dick
Of being smart and funny enough to pull it off. Yeah, that's what she told all of us.
Gerald
All of us? Who? [Dick looks to his left and Gerald follows his gaze. The other trolls in their group are there with their own briefcases]
Anonymous 821
Hey Skankhunt.
Gerald
What the hell is going on?
Dick
Don't you get it? The government made some kind of deal with the Danish. They handed us over so they wouldn't go forward with their Trolltrace program. They wanted the troll who killed Freja Ollegard and his associates. We got sold out because of you!
Gerald
No! [runs to the vault door] No, you've got to let me out of here! I'm not one of them! [pounds on the door in vain. The briefcases begin to beep]
Anonymous 821
[notices] Hey look, it's 9:30. The briefcases are about to go off. [When the briefcases pop open, they prepare to die, but they get rickrolled instead.]
Butters' room, night. Bill Clinton is still talking to Butters, who's still mad. They sit side by side on Butters' bed.
Bill Clinton
What do you think you're gonna achieve, young man? Do you really think all this pickle-pressing is gonna get you anywhere?
Butters
Well, I'm just angry, Mr. Gentleman. I'm tired of girls saying boys need to change. Somebody has to stand up for our rights!
Bill Clinton
What happened, son? Did a girl break your heart?
Butters
[suddenly tears up] No.
Bill Clinton
I know. I know how hard they can be. But... somethin's about to happen that you aren't aware of. [stands up and walks off a bit] You see, Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. And trust me, my wife is a crazy bitch. She and all the other women in the world are about to get payback. And we are all completely fucked. It's my fault, really. I've done things my whole life that gradually broke her spirit. And now that she's lost everything, let me assure you: she is piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiissed. [walks back to the bed and sits down] Now, our only chance is to keep our heads low and act like we're changed men. Because, we're very close to the end.
Butters
The end? Of what?
Bill Clinton
Women are sick of our shit, son. And soon, they're gonna know everything we've said and done online. And unless we start kissin' their asses, we're all gonna be put in a big chamber underground and milked for our semen.
A hill in Hawthorne, California. Cartman and Heidi make their way to its crest.
Heidi
Eric, we're so far from home.
Cartman
We aren't gonna see home again, babe. We're gonna make it. There's no turning back.
Heidi
You really think there's hope?
Cartman
Yes. I do. [before them is SpaceX]
End of Oh, Jeez

Members Only
Tom's Rhinoplasty. A government agent speaks with Bannon.
Government agent
The political world is watching, Bannon. [gives Bannon a file] We need to make sure the president elect has a smooth transition.
Bannon
All indications are that his transition [flips a page] is going to be fine.
Surgeon
[walks by] We're just doing some finishing touches, but everything went well. You can see him now if you like.
Caitlyn
I'll go.
Caitlyn walks into a technologically advanced room where Garrison is seen having a blond, push-back wig put on his head by a mechanical arm.
Garrison
[talks with Caitlyn] Well, do I look presidential?
Caitlyn
Honestly, you look twenty years younger.
Garrison
They really worked on my stank face. Look! Whenever I don't know what people are talking about, I just do this, [lowers his body] like look. [shows his stank face] I can do this. [shows his stank face again] This is, this is my stank face. [shows a different stank face] It's like, I'm not listening to you, see? [shows his other stank face] They did a really good job on my stank lips.
Caitlyn
It's an amazing transition.
Garrison
Now I feel ready to take care of business and do what really matters... [sits up straight] in just a minute, I'm gonna do the UV rays a bit longer.
[the machine closes enseals Garrison]
SpaceX. Cartman and Heidi walk to the desk.
Secretary
Can I help you?
Cartman
Hello. I understand that you're trying to get to Mars. This is my girlfriend, Heidi. She's really smart and really funny.
Secretary
...Okay.
Cartman
We've given up social media and we'd like to be somewhere as far from the internet as possible. Is it true Mars would have really shitty Wi-Fi?
Secretary
...That'd be an understatement, yes.
Cartman
Well, we'd like to go. We can't tolerate this world anymore and we'd like to talk to whoever we can about getting to Mars as soon as possible please.
Secretary
Uh-huh. Take a number and join the others.
Cartman
What others?
[Cartman, Heidi, and the secretary turn their heads see a bunch of other people waiting, including Cher singing]
Cher
[garbled and auto-tuned] If I could turn back time...
Cartman
What the fuck, dude?!
Secretary
Lot of people want to leave the planet right now.
Cartman
Ah god dammit, is that Cher?!
Cher
[garbled and auto-tuned] Do you believe in leaving the world, oh...
South Park Elementary, principal's office.
PC Principal
God [knocks down papers] dammit! [knocks down lamp] How the fuck did this happen?!
Mackey
[knocks the door and opens it] Uh, sorry PC Principal, but someone wants to speak with you.
PC Principal
I told you to leave me alone, Mackey! [slams fist on the desk] I'm not in the mood!
Mackey
But, but sir, the president elect is here. [moves away from Garrison]
Garrison
[enters the office with two Secret Service agents following him] So sorry for the intrusion. You're not too busy, I hope.
PC Principal
Uh, not at all. Please uh, have a seat, Mr. Garrison.
Garrison
Excuse me?
PC Principal
Uh, please have a seat, Mr... President.
Garrison
That's better, bitch. [sits down and takes out a piece of gum]
PC Principal
Certainly want to uh, congratulate you on the election.
Garrison
Do you remember the day you fired me, PC Principal?
PC Principal
I know we've had some differences, uh...
Garrison
I was upset because a bunch of immigrants were changing my class and I believe your response was that I needed to go and "learn their language", "be more open-minded".
PC Principal
I'm sorry that your position here at the school was terminated.
Garrison
Are you really? [makes stank face] Are you really sorry? [makes different stank face] Because you see PC Principal, you helped create me. You insisted that I was a bigot, that I was an intolerant relic left over from another time. But now, I'm your president. And if there's one thing I've learned about becoming president, it's that your penis can get really dry. When all the skin on your penis is drying out from working so hard to get elected there's only one thing that can fix it, isn't there? Saliva, from a good friend who once doubted you. I need you to fix my problem, PC Principal, so that we can be even-stevens. What do you say, bud?
PC Principal
[is in complete shock]
Outside of unknown club. Two people got out of the club. The berries head to a tiny door.
Unknown Berries
Oh, 'member when it fell in her drink. Yeah, I 'member.
Memberberry 1
'Member when Han shot Greedo?
Memberberry 2
Sure, I 'member Greedo.
Tubbs
Ha, I 'member Greedo.
Memberberry 3
'Member?
Memberberry 1
[knocks at the small door]
Guard Berry
[opens small window] What's the password, 'member?
Memberberry 3
Yeah, I 'member.
Memberberry 1
You 'member?
Guard Berry
I 'member. [opens the door, lets the berries in, and then closes the door immediately]
Inside a Memberberry bar. Random berries keep on saying "'Member".
Memberberry 1
Ha ha, 'member this place? [hops away]
Memberberry 2
Sure, I 'member. [rolls away]
Memberberry 4
[hops away] 'Member the Tantive IV?
Memberberry 1
Oh, I love that ship. [stops moving]
Memberberry 3
[goes with the other berries and talks to an old berry] Hi, it's us, 'member?!
Don
Ah sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 4
We did the thing with throwing Mickey in the drink, 'member?!
Don
Ah sure, I 'member; just 'cause of youse, we won the election.
Tubbs
Yeah yeah, 'member?
Don
Waiter, round of drinks for our heroes here, 'member?
Waiter Berry
I 'member.
Don
You done good poisoning the lady's drink. Now our man is in office, 'member? But I still have things I need you to do.
Tubbs
Hehe, hehe, I 'member.
TrollTrace Headquarters: vault. Gerald repeatedly knocks on the exit door with all his might.
Gerald
Please, you have to let me outta here!
Dick
Skankhunt, stop!
Bedrager
[talks from above] Yes, please. You're making a very jackass of-a yourself.
Gerald
[walks to see Bedrager's face]
Bedrager
Well well, what do we have here? Looks like your little troll-party.
Troll 4
You Danish pricks, you tricked us!
Bedrager
We didn't trick you, your own government did. They thought if they handed you over to us we would agree not to go forward with the TrollTrace program.
Gerald
You can't hold people prisoner! I haven't done anything! People are gonna be looking for me!
Bedrager
[takes out his phone] By all means, [tosses the phone to Gerald] contact whoever you want. Of course, you'll have to tell them why you're here.
Dick
What are you gonna do with us?
Bedrager
We're going to use you to set the world on fire. When the servers go online, there will be chaos, panic, and war. And from the ashes, a new world will rise: a world where everyone is happy, and singing, and has no secrets, [yells] like Denmark! [punches a railing]
Dick
You think you can turn countries in the world against each other? Our president will never let that happen.
Unknown supermarket. Garrison and Secret Service agents enter the store.
Garrison
Hey everybody! [walks to a checkout line, takes a mic, and hums "Hail To The Chief"] Guess who's here? It's the President of the United Fucking States. [mic drop, then walks around the store] Oh, it's been a while since I've heard from you guys. Hi, Janice. [takes a small bottle of water from her shopping basket and opens it, tossing the cap away] Hello, Stephen.
Stephen
[looks away] Mr. President.
Garrison
[walks around the store some more] I was just, you know, passing through the old neighborhood [checks out a tomato paste can from another shopper] thinking about what laws I might get rid of, when suddenly, out of nowhere, my penis got really dry. You know if they have anything at this store for a dry dick? Huh? No? You guys can't think of anything? Oh, I know. What about [points to] Eduardo Hernandez? I believe it was Eduardo who told me I couldn't double-bag my groceries, even though he's from fucking Guatemala. Well, what do you think now, Eduardo? You wanna double-bag somethin' else? [his phone rings, and he pulls out out of his back pocket to answer it] This is the President.
First General
Sir, we need you at the Pentagon. It's a matter of national security.
Garrison
Oh, really? I'm kinda busy right now, jeez.
First General
Sir, the Danish have released a statement. I'm afraid... we may be going to war.
Garrison
War?
Ike's room, day. He's playing a first-person shooter game when a Skype call comes in.
Gerald
Ike?! Ike, buddy, can you hear me?! I need you to do something, okay? Daddy needs your help! I need you to go to your browser and sign on to the school message board, okay? Can you do that for me? The school message board and then log in. Lowercase S, skank-hunt-4-2. You got it?
The other trolls witness Gerald's actions.
Dick
Wow.
Anonymous821
Wow, what?
Dick
He's gonna have his son sign in and troll for him.
Gerald
[covers his phone and faces the other trolls] If Skankhunt is still out there trolling, then they have the wrong guy! Get it?! It's called "using your brain", fatso!
Anonymous821
So they'll blame your kid?
Gerald
Nobody cares if a kid trolls! What are they gonna do, get a slap on the wrist?
Dick
[stands up] Didn't you hear what that guy said? They're gonna set countries against each other! We have way bigger problems!
Gerald
You don't know my fucking wife! [faces the phone] Ike, you got it? Great, pal! Okay, now I need you to go to the comment section, okay, and type in "You should all get raped by gorillas". You got that pal? Ike, "You should all get raped by gorillas"! Come on, we have a lot of work to do here!
SpaceX. Heidi and Cartman sit next to each other on separate chairs.
Cartman
Jesus, I didn't think getting to Mars would take this long.
Heidi
You really think this is what we should do, babe? I gonna miss everyone.
Cartman
I know, but it'll be worth it, babe. We'll be left alone to make our new world better.
Butters
Hey, Eric! [seen right near Cartman]
Cartman
[speaks to Butters] What the hell are you doing here?
Butters
Well I want to get the fuck off this planet, but they told me I had to take a number.
Cartman
Oh no no no! You're a male chauvinist sexist pig, Butters. You don't get to go to Mars.
Butters
[shows complete fear] No, you don't understand. I've seen the light, I'm a changed man, I thought boys were being treated unfairly, but now I know... shit's about to get a lot worse.
Outside of the White House. Memberberries start incoherent 'membering.
Memberberries
'Member The Fugitive? [Millions of Memberberries are 'membering.] 'Member Aliens? [They begin to jump the fence] Here we are! Ah, yeah! I 'member. Come on, everybody, 'member? [The large group of Memberberries continue 'membering.] 'Member snow speeders? [They approach the front door.] Yeah, I 'member! 'Member not hearing? [They breach the front door and pour into the main foyer.] 'Member the invasion of Hoth? Haha! 'Member "you rebel scum"? I 'member! [They fill the entire floor of the White House entrance.] Oh, 'member the rebel transports? [Thousands of Memberberries open the door to the Oval Office, and pour in.]
Memberberry 1
"We did it!" 'Member? [Five Memberberries take their place on the president's desk.]
Memberberry 2
Sure, I 'member!
Memberberry 3
What do we do now?
Memberberry 4
Don't you 'member?
Tubbs
Ooh, I 'member.
Ike's room. Ike sets up the profile photo of Mrs. Herrera and a penis in a small Photoshop tab while Gerald is on Skype.
Gerald
Okay now make sure the little worm is in the woman's mouth, got it?
Ike
[puts penis in photoshopped mouth]
Gerald
Now I need you to type "You're a fat retard" in the comments.
Ike
[types in the comment section] "You're a retard."
Gerald
No, you have to say "a fat retard", Ike! It's a nuance, but it's very important!
Ike
[types in the comment section] "You are a fat retard."
Sheila
[sees what Ike is doing and is in shock] Ike! What are you doing?!
Ike
What he says.
Gerald
[exits Skype chat]
Sheila
[walks into Ike's room and gets a closer look] It was you, all this time! What have you done, Ike?! Do you have any idea the damage you've caused?! How could my child be such a monster?! [answers the call on her phone] Yes yes, hello?!
Gerald
[talks on his phone to Sheila] Hey sweetheart, how's everything going?
Sheila
You have to come home from helping the government, Gerald! I just caught Ike trolling Mrs. Herrera!
Gerald
Are you serious?
Sheila
Yes! The school troll is our son, Gerald! You should see all the things he's posted on his computer!
Gerald
God dang it! Let me talk to him right now!
Shelia
[hands her phone to Ike]
Ike
Hello?
Gerald
Hey Ike, just stay calm and act like I'm yelling at you, okay pal? Okay, give it a few seconds, wait. Good. Okay, now--now say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside".
Ike
No!
Gerald
Ike, you have to listen to me. On your mother's life, this is a matter of national security! You have to say "I'm sorry, dad. I guess I'm just fucked up inside"!
Ike
[angrily] I'm sorry dad. I'm just fucked up inside.
Gerald
That was amazing, kiddo. It'll all be worth it, okay? I'll make this up to you. Give me back to your mom.
Sheila
[takes her phone back] Gerald?!
Gerald
He's full of shit, he's not sorry! If he felt sorry, he wouldn't be able to do it in the first place!
Sheila
I know!
Gerald
I'm gonna get home as soon as I can to deal with this, okay? We can deal with this together. Just don't say anything to anyone for now, all right?
Sheila
Okay. Okay yeah, I love you too. I know. Bye. [ends the call and talks to Ike] You just sit in here until we figure out what to do; and if you get back on that computer, you are done, you got it?! [leaves Ike's room]
Gerald
[starts a Skype call on Ike's computer] Ike! Okay there's just a few more things I need you to do. I need you to type "How'd you like a donkey dick?".
Pentagon. Garrison and four Secret Service agents walk to the general.
First General
[salutes] Welcome to the Pentagon, sir. I've been ordered to show you around. [turns around] This way, please.
Garrison
[follows the general] So I can do whatever the fuck I want in here now, right?
First General
Yes, sir. Here are all [gives Garrison a folder of classified information] our military secrets and all classified information.
Garrison
[takes folder] Okay, good.
First General
[stops everyone by the Drone Program entrance] This is the Drone Program. In there you can kill anyone on Earth remotely. Here's the keys. [gives keys to Garrison]
Garrison
Thanks!
[everyone continues walking]
First General
In here is satellite surveillance where you can monitor anyone's conversation live.
Garrison
Oh that will come in handy.
First General
Extreme interrogation [stops everyone] room in case you find interrogation necessary.
Garrison
Oh hell yeah, it's necessary. Let's do it.
First General
[gives Garrison a briefcase] And here of course is the famous "football", where you could order a nuclear attack in four minutes. [walks away]
Garrison
Love me some football. [follows the general]
First General
[stops everyone by the Diplomatic Strategy entrance] And finally, in here, is the diplomatic strategy and negotiating room. [opens the doors, having everyone enter the room]
People in the room are noticing high alerts across the world.
Garrison
Well, jeez, this doesn't look very fun.
Second General
Thank God you're here sir. We need your guidance.
SpaceX. Butters sits next to Cartman by his left side.
Butters
Loolooloo, I've got some apples. Loolooloo, you've got some too.
Cartman
Butter, Butters! You expect people to believe that you went from being the biggest asshole in the school to a softhearted feminist like me? Fat chance.
Butters
No no, believe me. I'm a changed man. Girls are really smart, and they'll be running the country soon, and they deserve total respect.
Cartman
Yeah? You just forgot one thing, that women are funny too. That didn't occur to you, did it, Butters?
Butters
Well I don't think there was ever any question women are funny. Remember that movie 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton?
Heidi
Oh yeah, that movie was funny.
Butters
Well I laughed my butt off and it never even occurred to me that they were women. I don't know why things changed. I don't know why people make such a big deal about women and comedy now. I mean what about Carol Burnett? She was great.
Heidi
Wow, I guess you're right.
Cartman
Yeah, I mean, when women make vagina jokes I think it's the funniest thing ever!
Butters
Yeah, well I swear I don't care how many times Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I laugh every time.
Cartman
[looks at Heidi, then at Butters, then in a low voice] Oh, I see what you're doing.
Heidi
What, babe?
Cartman
Oh nothin', babe. I'm just... Do you think you could tell me some jokes?
Heidi
[giggles] Why do you want me telling you jokes all the time?
Cartman
Because you're [glares at Butters] fucking hilarious.
Heidi
Well, did I tell you the one about the skeleton and the skunk?
Butters
[laughs] That's already funny! [Cartman gets frustrated and makes a fist with his left hand]
The Pentagon
Second General
All around the world, countries are mobilizing armies and preparing defensive countermeasures.
Garrison
Why? What the hell happened?
First General
This is everything you need to know about the TROLL TRACE program.
Garrison
What's TROLL TRACE?
First General
A plan by the Danish to release the full internet histories of everyone on Earth.
Second General
The previous administration tried to work with the Danish by handing over several trolls, but the plan didn't work.
First General
The entire world has become very uncertain and unstable.
Second General
We think we should order all navy vessels to the Bering Sea.
Garrison
For what?
First General
Because when the Chinese are able to see all our e-mails and online activity, we believe they will most likely attack us. Also, there are ground troops mobilizing in Paris because the French believe when we see all their e-mails, we will most likely attack them.
Third General
Mr. President, sir! The Russians are asking what we intend to do about the Danish.
Garrison
Well, why are you asking me?
Second General
Please, sir, we have very little time before this escalates beyond our control.
The Kremlin, Russia, day. What follows is what's on the video, although the language is said to be Russian.
Aide 1
Президент Путин, Датское утверждает, что они всё ещё готовы включить программу Troll Trase.
Putin
Это всё, что я сказай, всё, что я сделай на Интернет будет доступно моей подруге?
Aide 1
Да, кажется так.
Putin
Датское должно быть оставновлены! Мы нужно знать, как Соединённые Штаты стоят на этом! [behind him, the phone rings at his desk and a second aide pops in to answer it]
Aide 2
Э... Господин президент, Овальный кабинет. [Putin walks to the phone]
Putin
Да, это президент Путин.
Memberberry 3
'Member the Death Star?
Memberberry 1
Ahahaha, 'member cutting open tauntauns?
Memberberry 4
Yeah, yeah, 'member the Force? [the berries chuckle]
Putin
Что это такое?
Tubbs
Heheh, heheh, yeah, sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 1
Member McGy-?
Tubbs
Sure, I 'member.
Memberberry 3
'Member?
Memberberry 2
Heheh, hey hey hey, 'member the Cold War?
Memberberry 1
Oh I loved the Cold War! That was fantastic!
SpaceX, day. Everyone is still waiting for the ride to Mars.
Tour Assistant
Okay, Numbers 204 through 215, you can come on through.
Cartman
[leaves with Heidi] Oh, finally.
Butters
Hey, that's me too. Yippee!
Tour Assistant
Right in here, everyone. [The group, which includes Cher, walks in, and the door slams shut behind them]
Elon Musk
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the tour. I'm Elon Musk. Are we gonna have some fun today?
Cartman
Oh great, a stupid tour guide. Can we just talk to someone important please? We want to go to Mars.
Elon Musk
And getting anywhere takes ingenuity. Oh, Mrs. Door? Would you mind... opening, please?
PA Door Voice
[interactive doors] Yes, Elon. [the doors rattle, but don't open. Elon turns and opens them manually. A chime plays as the doors open, and Elon leads the group onto the factory floor]
Elon Musk
The only way for humankind to survive is with imagination and technology. Cars that run on electricity. Solar panels that replace roof shingles. Even food that changes form. You see this? It's a pizza, only four inches long. And yet, when heated, it expands to make enough pizza to feed a hundred people. I call it the pizza... pocket.
Cartman
[whispering to Heidi] They already have Pizza Pockets.
Elon Musk
Who would like to see the Hyperloop? A new mode of travel that can take you from here to Dubai in nine minutes.
Cartman
Excuse me, Mr. Musk, this is all super interesting and shit, but can we see the Mars rocket now?
Meanwhile, at the Pentagon...
Staffer 1
Sir, India is moving aircraft carriers into the Gulf of Mexico.
Garrison
Well why would we care about Mexicans?!
Staffer 2
[in winter fatigues] Sir, a message from Saudi Arabia. They say they pinky-promise not to look up our Internet history if we pinky-promise not to look up theirs.
Garrison
Well what does that even mean?!
Staffer 3
[in winter fatigues] Still waiting on if we should send troops into Japan, sir.
Garrison
I don't know, jeez!
First General
Sir, it's the UK Secretary of Foreign Affairs calling from London. He says they have advice for you.
Garrison
What?
Boris Johnson
Yes, hello? Things aren't looking good here. We just want to say, whatever you do, don't eat the membberries.
UK Aide
[overhearing] Don't eat the membberries. They are bad.
Garrison
Memberries?
Boris Johnson
I'm afraid everyone here who ate the memberries wanted to go back in the past, you see. Hasn't worked out too well for us.
UK Aide
We shouldn't have ate the memberries!
Boris Johnson
The memberries cloud your judgement. They get inside your head, you see.
Garrison
Get inside your head... Wait a minute... Nobody gets in my head, you limey bitch! Are you insulting me?! Stop wasting my time! 'Cause I'll have you here on a plane in five hours suckin' my dick!! [slams the phone down on the receiver]
UK Aide
What'd he say?
Boris Johnson
I believe they've eaten the memberries.
UK Aide
Ooh, dear!
UK Aide 2
Ooh, dear!
SpaceX tour, day. The tour is winding down.
Elon Musk
Here you see our Falcon 9 full-thrust rockets. They are actually able to take off into space and land safely back on Earth for reuse. [the group moves back to the lobby] Well, I certainly wanna thank you all for joining our tour today. You've been a wonderful group. Give yourselves a round of applause.
Groups
Huh?
Cartman
Whoawhoawhoawhoa, what about going to Mars?
Elon Musk
Mars? We're still about ten years away from going to Mars. Maybe eight.
Groups
Awwww.
Cartman
No, no nonono, we have to go now!
Elon Musk
Well I'm sorry, but it's a bit more complicated than a pizza pocket. Going to Mars is gonna take a lot of very smart people working very hard for a very long time. Now, if you don't mind, I have hundreds of more tours to do. [turns to exit the lobby]
Butters
Mr. Musk, wait! [Musk turns around] Maybe we can help you get to Mars sooner. I'm not sure if you know our friend, Heidi. She's really smart, and really funny. [Cartman flashes an angry face at Butters]
Elon Musk
Like... how funny?
The White House. Some member berries have formed a group and are performing "Africa". A vintage car horn is heard and the mob boss arrives with some henchmen. "Sing Sing Sing" blares from the radio.
Don
Out of the way, 'member?
Berry Henchmen
You'd better 'member if you know what's good for youse! [the car moves through the crowd, down the corridors and into the Oval Office]
Memberberries
Hey look, it's them. 'Member? Sure, I 'member. [the mobster berries get out of the car]
Don
Ey, youse did good. Who's in charge, 'member?
Memberberry 3
We decided he's in charge.
Memberberry 1
No, we said I'm in charge, 'member?
Memberberry 4
No wait, I 'member. We all said he's in charge. [leans to the left]
Memberberry 2
Oh yeah, I 'member.
Don
Wrong. [shoots Member Berry 2 clear through. Member Berry 2 collapses and bleeds out green juice]
Memberberry 3
Waaah!
Don
'Member stormtroopers?
Memberberry 2
Sure, I 'member.
Don
Not those stormtroopers! The real old ones. People wanna 'member? They're gonna 'member.
The Broflovski house. Kyle comes home from school and is about to go upstairs when he sees Ike in a corner, in time out. Ike has his head against the wall.
Kyle
Ike? [Ike looks back at Kyle, then puts his head on the wall again] What are you doing?
Sheila
Don't talk to him! He is in big trouble!
Kyle
Well what'd he do?
Sheila
It's him, Kyle! Your brother is the internet troll who's caused all this pain in our community!
Kyle
What?
Sheila
It was him all along. Now we have to figure out what to tell people when they learn this ugliness came from our family. [walks back into the kitchen]
Kyle
You made people quit Twitter? You started a war between boys and girls? You...?
Kyle stops and thinks back to the clues he's heard in recent days.
Heidi
I call it "Emoji Analysis". It isn't a student, it's an adult.
Sheila
This ugliness came from our family!
Heidi
I think it's one of the parents.
Gerald
You're suppose to just laugh and make fun of shit.
Ike
Daddy called you a pussy.
Kyle
[stops thinking back] Oh my God. Oh my God! Ike, come on! [grabs Ike's hand and rushes out the front door with him. Sheila hears the front door open and looks around for her boys. She reaches the open front door]
Sheila
Kyle? Ike?! Whatwhatwhaaat?! [her voice echoes around the neighborhood]
End of Members Only

Not Funny
In front of Park County Police Station. A crowd gets riled up while Harrison starts a speech.
Harrison
Everyone calm down, please. We have to have civil order. Listen to me.
[crowd stops chattering]
Unknown person
Really?
Harrison
Now I know everyone's scared, but we have to keep control. Yes all of our emails and Internet histories are about to become public knowledge.
[crowd chatters]
Harrison
[raises his arms] But, but,
[crowd stops]
Harrison
we all need to understand that TrollTrace will never happen if people don't log on to use it. The website is a massive database that cross-references everything ever said on the Internet. It relies on people typing in a name and address of someone else [lays arms on stand] to add to that database. If we could all agree to resist the urge to look up other people's Internet histories, [looks at Maggie] Maggie, okay? As long as we all respect each other's privacy, darling, [looks straight ahead] then our town won't suffer the same fate as Fort Collins.
Stephen
And what are the police gonna do to make sure people don't use it?! I know I'll certainly respect others' privacy, but about other people like [points at Laura] Laura Tucker the Blabbermouth?
Laura
Excuse me?
Harrison
And that's why we have to come together as a community, and resist any temptation to use TrollTrace, [looks at Maggie] Maggie. We have to stay in control. [looks in front of him] This hack of our city will never happen, so long as we rely on the rationality and the basic decency of the American people.
[crowd panics and runs away]
Harrison
Guess I could've worded that differently.
Kyle's room. Kyle sits on bed with his head lowered while Sheila stands near the doorway.
Sheila
[yells] What were you thinking?! How dare you outright defy me like that! Your brother was being punished for using the computer and you decide to just leave with him?
Kyle
I just felt bad for him, ma.
Sheila
You felt bad for him, after all the horrible things he said to people online?! Your brother is a sick troll, Kyle! You just wait until your father gets home. [leaves the room and closes the door]
Ike's room. Ike sits on his bed miserably. He suddenly gets a Skype call from Gerald. Ike goes to his computer and accepts the call.
Gerald
Ike, where the fuck have you been?! Daddy needs your help. You don't want Mommy and Daddy to get divorced, do you? [paces] You know how bad your mom is, she completely overreacts to everything. That's where your brother gets it from. You don't want to be like Kyle, do you?
Kyle
[goes in front of the computer] Hi dad.
Gerald
[gets shocked] Hey, buddy! Everything good there?
Kyle
It was you, this whole time. You're the troll that caused all of this trouble.
Gerald
No, it was your brother. I don't know what's wrong with him, Kyle. He needs counseling...
Kyle
Heidi Turner did an emoji analysis. It was an adult. It was you.
Gerald
[starts talking right before Kyle finished] Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Okay, keep your voice down.
Kyle
[talks softly] Why dad? Why did you do this?
Gerald
Because it's fucking funny, Kyle. It's called having a sense of humor, and laughing. You should fucking try it once in a while!
Kyle
Putting a penis in the mouth of a mom who has cancer is funny?!
Gerald
Because it's so not funny, God! Pushing people's buttons to get a reaction can actually be very good for society, Kyle. Listen to me, the Danish are fucking crazy. You have to get people to stop them.
Kyle
How?!
Gerald
Go get people riled up. Call the President. I don't know. When you push people's buttons, they go and push other people's buttons. Now get out there and... [ends call]
Sheila
[enters Ike's room and yells] Kyle, Ike! What the hell is this?! What did I say?! Get off of that computer riiight nooooow!
Ike
[puts his head down]
Outside of SpaceX. SpaceX is surrounded by a barb-wired gate in which a crowd of people get riled up behind it, with some trying to climb.
Secretary
Uh everyone, please listen! We don't have any rockets going to Mars! Yo-you're not listening! We don't have the energy requirements figured out yet. We're working as hard as we can. There's a little girl working on the people right now and apparently she's incredibly smart and funny.
SpaceX:laboratory. Heidi stares at a large white board filled with charts and equations.
Cartman
[walks to Heidi with mug] You got it figured out yet, babe?
Heidi
[grabs mug] Babe, I have no idea what any of this means.
Cartman
Heidi, yes you do. You just have to get over yourself. Come on, say it. Say it.
Heidi
Girls rule, women are funny, get over it.
Cartman
[does a one-sided hug on Heidi] Get over it, baby. Stop holding yourself back.
Heidi
[sighs]
Elon Musk
Uh excuse me. Sorry, can we have a word please?
Cartman
[yells at Elon Musk] What the fuck do you want?! [talks to Heidi] Hang on, babe. [runs towards Elon Musk]
Elon Musk
This doesn't seem like it's gonna work out and we're rather busy.
Cartman
Just give her a chance. [turns around] She's the smartest, funniest girl on Earth.
Elon Musk
I haven't really heard her say anything funny.
Cartman
Yeah, [points at his own head] that's because you have a mental block, Elon Musk. [lowers his arm] They won't let you get over yourself.
Butters
[sits on chair, watching the conversation] He-heyeah! Don't worry about Heidi, she's a hoot.
Cartman
[faces Butters with a mad face]
TrollTrace: vault. The vault door gets unlocked.
Dick
Here they come.
[Dane 2 opens the door as Bedrager, Dane 1, Dane 4, and him enter. The trolls stand up]
Gerald
Oh thank god. There's been a mistake, okay?! I'm not one of [points at the other trolls] them. My son is Skankhunt42. Go online and see, he's still doing it!
Dane 2
[points a gun at the trolls]
Bedrager
All of you, remove your clothes.
Anonymous821
What are you gonna do with us?
Bedrager
Remove your clothes now!
[the trolls strip themselves naked]
TrollTrace: Observatory room. The entrance door opens.
Dane 2
[enters] In here, move.
[trolls enter the room in a line where they are put on separate chairs, handcuffed]
Gerald
[gets frieghtened] Oh god! Oh god, they're gonna [gets kicked by Dane 5] kill us! No no, wait! Okay okay, it was me! You're right, I'm Skankhunt! But I am not like them. Please, [gets put on a chair] I have a good job! I'm a good guy! [gets handcuffed] I'm sorry! [sighs heavily] I was just being funny! I was trying to make people laugh! [sees the Danes leaving the room] That's a positive thing, right?! I wasn't doing it to hurt people, I was just doing comedy. It's different! Please, it's different!
[the door closes]
South Park Church. Maxi makes a speech to people praying.
Maxi
Lord, we look to thee on this to our most trouble hour. We have been let astray and now all we could do is wait for the inevitable to happen. Soon everything we have said and done online is going to be known to all. Many lives will be turned upside down. Of course, I have nothing to worry about; since I'm a priest, there's nothing I'm ashamed of doing on the Internet, so [turns a page] definitely no reason to look up my history. But uh for many, this is a time to pray.
Everyone
[speak in unison] O'Lord, please forgive for things we might have done online.
Harrison
Maggie.
Men
Please try to understand that even some of us who were on MatchingMavis.com, it was only out of curiosity, and not because we actually having an affair. Please understand that we might have used racial slurs, but only because it was to a close friend and never meant to be public.
Kyle
[enters with Ike] What are you all doing?! [walks closer to the priest] Somebody's threatening your way of life and you all are just sitting here praying, like uh a bunch of babies?
Ike
[follows Kyle] Like a bunch of pussies!
Kyle
Come on, this isn't South Park! What's happened to us?! We used to have a challenge and deal with it, then move onto the next one. Now we've just been dealing with trolling and Internet stuff over and over, week after week; and I don't know about you, but I'm getting pretty sick of it.
Randy
Yeah.
Kyle
[stands on a step near Maxi] Now for once let's take a stand and try to end this. We can't let Denmark change who we are.
Randy
Yeah, fuck Denmark.
Prayers
[speak after one another] Yeah!
Kyle
You guys need to, you know, call the President and get him to take action.
Prayers
[speak in disappointment] Aw!
Stephen
The President? He won't listen to us. He hates us now.
Randy
No, [stands up] but there is somebody he will still listen to.
The Pentagon: Diplomatic Strategy room.
First General
Mr. President, we're looking at global destabilization blinked we've never seen. Countries everywhere are terrified their Internet may be hacked.
Garrison
Well what do they want me to do about it?
Second General
You're the leader of the free world. Everyone's looking to you to be the call and steady voice they all need.
Army Soldier
[salutes] Mr. President? Mr. President, the Isreali prime minister is on Line 1, the chancellor of Germany is on Line 2, and a Mr. Slave is on Line 3.
Garrison
Mr. Slave? [picks up the phone on Line 3] This is the President.
Mr. Slave
[talks at his house while looking at his fingernails] Hey, what's up?
Garrison
Well well well, crawling outta the woodwork to try and get me back now that I am a big cheese?
Mr. Slave's house is shown to have other South Park residents.
Mr. Slave
No, I'm calling because people want you to bomb Denmark.
Garrison
Who wants me to bomb Denmark?
Mr. Slave
Lots of people 'cause it's like gonna ruin their freedom of speech or something.
Garrison
Mr. Slave, this is all very complicated, diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't just go bombing other countries.
Mr. Slave
Oh Jesus Christ, you're such a little bitch.
Garrison
Oh I'm a bitch, huh? I happen to be President, bitch!
Mr. Slave
You're a little bitch, President. You're too scared to bomb anybody.
Garrison
I'm not scared, my advisors have told me that I...
Mr. Slave
Yeah, you're scared, just do what your little advisors tell you to do.
Garrison
If I decide a military strike on Denmark is warranted, then I will...
Mr. Slave
You don't have the balls to bomb them, pussy.
Ike
Pussy ass bitch.
Mr. Slave
Pussy ass bitch, fuck you.
Garrison
Oh [rambles] okay! You think so, huh?! Well watch this you gay asshole! [yells at the generals] Bomb Denmark!
First General
Sir?
Garrison
[turns around] The TrollTrace building or the whole fucking thing! Whatever it is, get the missiles ready!
Mr. Slave
[talks to others in his house] Yeah, it worked.
Kyle
Alright!
[everyone else cheered]
SpaceX. Butters walks to the men's room.
Butters
[talks to woman employee walking by] Hello. [enters the bathroom]
Cartman
[enters the men's room and sees Butters using the urinal] What are you doing?
Butters
[talks to Cartman] Going pee!
Cartman
I mean what are you doing here calling my girlfriend funny? You better back off! You don't even know her, your just saying it! How do you even know she's funny?!
Butters
Because you keep on telling everyone she is.
Cartman
Butters, Heidi is everything to me. If you take her, I swear to god...
Butters
Eric Eric, trust me! I want nothing to do with girlfriends! [walks closer to the toilets] I know what girlfriends do; they make you feel happy like you never felt, then they crawl up inside of you and poop out your heart.
Cartman
What are you talking about?
Butters
That's how it ends, Eric. Girls get you to feel for them, make you think they're the best thing in the world, and then they leave, move on to the next thing; and you're left there crying, with your heart covered in poop.
Cartman
Not Heidi, she's different. She's really smart, and really funny.
Butters
Sure buddy, sure.
Ike's room. Kyle and Ike read the news on the computer.
Kyle
Officials have stated that all communication with Denmark has end, and that a military strike on the country is now imminent.
Ike
Yay!
Kyle
The President stated that since then...
Sheila
[enters the room] Are you serious right now?!
Kyle & Ike
Augh! [get off the chair]
Sheila
[yells] Get off that computerrrr!
Kyle
Ma, we were just using it to look at the news.
Sheila
I don't care, I said no computers! You kids are addicted to the Internet! You're sick, and you're addicted! It's changed your brother, and now it's turning you against me, Kyle!
Kyle
I'm not against you, mom.
Sheila
You are! Your father goes away on business and all you do is defy me at every turn! The next time you defy me, it will be your last! Do you understand?!
Kyle & Ike
Yes, mom.
Sheila
And when your father is home from Denmark, you two are both going in for counseling.
Kyle & Ike
[in complete shock] Denmark?
Kyle
What is dad doing in Denmark?!
Sheila
The government sent him over to do paralegal training, so it would've nice if you could've shown a little support! [leaves the room and shuts the door]
Ike
Ohhh shit.
TrollTrace: Observatory room. The trolls are handcuffed and seated, facing the panels. Gerald is sobbing.
Gerald
[whimpering]Oh God! [continues whimpering]
Anonymous821
Will somebody shut him up?
Dick
Skank. Skank, get ahold of yourself
Gerald
You were right, Dildo, when you said I was a dick, when you called me an asshole. I am. And now I'm going to die alone, just like you said (starts crying again)
Dick
Come on. You're not an asshole
Gerald
[sobbing] You said I was, though, 'cause I only trolled to be...funny.
Dick
Well--Well, maybe being funny is just sort of how you deal with serious subjects.
Gerald
[sobbing] Really? You don't think I'm a bad person? I'm sorry. All you guys, I'm sorry
Trolls
That's okay. Okay, Skank. All right
Gerald
[calling out to TrollTrace staff] Excuse me. Hello?
TrollTrace: monitoring room. Bedrager is looking over a TrollTrace employee's notes, while the trolls are shown on the monitor
Gerald
Could I please speak to the person in charge? [Bedrager hears Gerald and walks over to the monitor] I have something to say. [security camera zooms in on Gerald] Please, just for a moment?
Bedrager
[stares intently at the monitor with the other employees] Bring him to the conference room
SpaceX:laboratory. Heidi continues to stares at a large white board filled with charts and equations. Cartman walks over and observes her from a distance
Heidi
[sighs], Dude, I am so not getting this.
Cartman
[walks away in shock]
SpaceX: Upper level walkway. Butters is leaning against the railing.
Cartman
[walks towards Butters and then leans against the railing] I just don't understand it. She's always been really smart before. And hilarious.
Butters
Don't feel bad about getting duped, Eric. Its happened to all of us.
Cartman
[Yells] Nobody's been duped! Stop suggesting that she's being manipulative. Why would she want to trick me?
Butters
The truth is girls hate us, Eric. They're sick of our shit. And one day, they plan to make us obsolete, stick us underground where we just get milked for our semen. Boys' only hope is to start over on Mars.
Cartman
[turns around and yells] That's ridiculous. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Heidi is the smartest, funniest person I've ever met. I'm not being tricked. And I'll prove it to everybody!
TrollTrace: Conference room. Bedrager is eating a meal while two Danes stand guard.
Gerald
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much for talking to me. I just really needed to get something off my chest. I'm so sorry. I had the biggest epiphany about the damage I've done, the people I've hurt, but the fact of the matter is I'm not really a troll. [Bedrager continues eating and not paying attention to Gerald.] I actually have a job. I'm a lawyer. I've got a loving wife and great kids. Uhm, I've got a family that really misses me and needs me.
Bedrager
[continues eating and not looking at Gerald] Freja Ollegard, the volleyball player, had a family, too. They miss her quite a lot too.
Gerald
And that--that is so tragic. And I'm so sorry that she was driven to kill herself by trolling. It's--It's wrong. But, you know, I just sort of set things in motion. See, I'm a satirist. I challenge people's point of views by being sort of edgy. [Bedrager stops and hears Gerald out] And sometimes, people can be like "Whoa!" and mistake that for hate, but its not hate. Its pointing out hypocrisies in out society.
Bedrager
You're so full of skinkinslat I can smell it from here.
Gerald
If you say mean things and you're mean, then I agree, you should be killed. But if you're being funny, which spreads joy --
Bedrager
You really think my plan is to kill you?
Gerald
It's not?
Bedrager
[To the two Danes standing guard] Leave us. [shoos them away with his hand] Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[The two Danes walk out of the room.]
Bedrager
[In a sinister tone] Do you want to know what's really funny?
The Pentagon: Diplomatic Strategy room. Staff is running around and Mr. Garrison is eating a tub of ice cream.
First General
Mr. President, the bombers are en route to Europe.
Second General
Are you sure you want to proceed with this?
Garrison
[Licking his ice cream spoon]Yeah, yeah. Bomb the shit out of them. We have to be tough here.
Army Soldier
Mr. President? Mr. President, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg is on Line 1, the Chairman of the Worker's Party is on Line 2, and Kyle is on Line 3.
Garrison
Oh geez. What does Kyle want.
[Walks over to red phone and picks up the receiver]
Garrison
This is the President
Kyle
[in his bedroom, with Ike] Mr. Garrison, you can't bomb Denmark!
Garrison
Oh, for Pete's sake, Kyle.
Kyle
It's--It's wrong and it could start a bigger war.
Garrison
Kyle, this is all very serious diplomatic stuff, okay? You can't understand the political complexities involved here.
Kyle
[Looks at phone in shock and then thinks of an answer] I understand that you're a dipshit little gay puppet.
Garrison
Excuse me?
Kyle
Letting your ex-boyfriend manipulate you 'cause you miss his sweet ass.
Garrison
Who told you that?
Kyle
Everyone knows that. You only do what your little bitch boyfriend manipulates you into doing.
Garrison
Kyle, I am the President.
Kyle
You're a little dipshit president.
Ike
With a dirty...asshole.
Kyle
With a dirty asshole.
Ike
And...you shit out your dick.
Kyle
And you shit out your dick. [covers phone with hand and looks at Ike] Where did you learn to talk like this?
Ike
Daddy!
Garrison
Oh that's what people think, huh? Well, maybe I won't bomb Denmark. What do you think about that?
Kyle
Yeah, you will, because you're a little retarded shit bitch.
Garrison
[Yelling] God fucking damn it [slams receiver] Hold up! Hold up on the fucking bombs a minute!
Outside of SpaceX. A large crowd is making noise and still trying to get in
SpaceX:laboratory. Heidi continues to stares at a large white board filled with charts and equations, with Elon Musk and his staff observing. Cartman walks up to her from behind
Cartman
[Nervously] Hey, babe. Uh, how's it going?
Heidi
[Stares intently at white board, not paying attention to Cartman] I don't understand what any of these symbols mean, so in my head I'm trying to replace them with something I know to try and see patterns.
Cartman
[Wipes his nose] Okay, cool. Uh, babe, you remember that funny thing you were saying about soup the other day. What was that again?
Heidi
And when I do that, I can see how everything lines up except for one thing.
[As Heidi continues staring at the board, the formulas start changing into random emojis]
Heidi
[Thinking] I call it [echo] "Emoji Analysis" [the formulas keeping changing into emojis as the echo continues].
Cartman
Do you--you remember that funny voice you did at McDonald's? You were like "Could you--Could you hand me my water," or something. I can't--I can't remember.
Heidi
These two don't line up, babe. The only things that are out of order.
Cartman
Or the time you said the thing about clouds and I was laughing so hard--What was that again?
Heidi
[Turns to Elon Musk and his staff] Excuse me. Is it possible that the seventh line from the right and the third one up from the bottom left are out of sequence?
[the Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker review his clipboard notes]
SpaceX Employee
I'm sorry?
Heidi
That stuff there. Its in the wrong place. It needs to come before that.
[the employees review their notes again]
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
[Looks at his laptop] Wait a minute. She might be on to something here
Cartman
Okay, okay, now could you just do the "my vagina" thing for them? Could you just say "my vagina"?
Heidi
[Turns around and runs towards Elon Musk] They're out of sequence! I'll show you! [Cartman looks on in shock as she leaves]
Cartman
What the fuck is happening?
TrollTrace: Conference room. Gerald is sitting at the conference table as Bedrager stands by a cart with wine and wine glasses.
Bedrager
[picks up an empty glass] Do you remember, Mr. a-Skankhunt, when you and your little buddies trolled the entire country of a-Denmark?
Gerald
And that was wrong, too. I certainly want to apologize for that.
Bedrager
[pours himself a glass of wine] That was certainly a display of the power of a-trolling, wasn't it.[turns around to face Gerald] But, what would be even more impressive?
Gerald
I-I don't understand.
Bedrager
What if you could troll the entire world? Somebody who could rise to political power through nothing more that pushing people's a-buttons and getting them all riled up, become the leader of...a Scandinavian country, perhaps, get them to listen to you when, actually...[speaks with an American accent] you're not even fucking Danish.
Gerald
No way.
Bedrager
Use that country to create a machine that relies on the shittiness of people to fuck over other people and watch the whole world go completely batshit.
[Bedrager walks over to a microphone and starts talking over the P.A. system]
Bedrager
[speaking with a Danish accent] Attention all a-TrollTrace workers. Please report to assembly hall one for a big announcement. [speaking with an American accent] Completely fool everyone [sits at table with Gerald] and keep your real intentions completely anonymous.
Gerald
You would--deliberately start World War III, let the people of Denmark die, set everyone on Earth against each other? Why?!
Bedrager
Because its freakin' hilarious! Getting a Scandinavian country to fight trolls by building a giant machine that actually shows everyone on Earth is kind of a troll, too?
Gerald
That's not funny.
Bedrager
That's not funny?! Don't be a fag, dude! That's real bro shit there. Sorry to step on your fucking dicks in the mouth and tit jokes, you amateur little pussy. Come on! Have some fucking balls!
Gerald
You can't do this to people! It's not right!
Bedrager
[chuckles] Listen to you. [picks up microphone from under the table and starts talking in a Danish accent again] All right, everyone. Show's about to begin. [clicks on remote]
TrollTrace: Assembly hall. Employees standing around, waiting for the show.
[Two Danes try to access a door with their access card, but are denied access and try manually opening the door with a crank handle. The wall panels slide back and show the remaining trolls in the Observatory room, who can also see the TrollTrace employees.]
Dick
What the fuck is going on?!
[The trolls and TrollTrace employees look at each other, before an overhead project starts up and a countdown begins on the panels. The music video for "Never Gonna Give You Up" then starts up]
Music video
Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you.
TrollTrace Employee
Uh-oh.
["Never Gonna Give You Up" continues playing in the background]
Dick
Wow. That's pretty impressive.
TrollTrace: Conference room. Bedrager quickly walks out of the conference room as Gerald tries to stop him.
Gerald
Waaiitt!!!
[Bedrager smiles as the doors shut and he slides his access card to lock the doors, trapping Gerald inside. He tries to break the glass doors open as Bedrager happily walks away.]
Ike's room. Ike is looking out the snow covered window with a candle nearby
Kyle
[standing in the hallway] Ike...It's time. [walks up to Ike] I don't know if I'm strong enough to go through with this, but its the only way now.
Ike
I know.
Kyle
Just remember--I always loved you, little brother.
Ike
I love you too, big brother.
Kyle
Let's...just get this over with.
Sheila's bedroom. Sheila is reading a book in bed. Ike comes up to her door and she notices him
Ike
Mommy?
Sheila
Yes?
Ike
Suck my balls. You're a fat bitch. [runs off]
Sheila
[angrily] Whhaaatt! [tosses book aside and jumps out of bed] You get back here, you little monster!
[Ike hops down the staircase and runs into the kitchen with Sheila behind him]
Sheila
[yelling] I have had it with you! Don't you run away from me, Ike! Who do you think you are?! [runs into the kitchen and sees Kyle standing there] Where is he?! Where is your brother?!
Kyle
He's in the pantry.
Sheila
[yelling] Don't you try and hide from me now! You are in big trouble now, Ike! [She continues on into the pantry before Kyle shuts the door on her and puts a chair against it] Whaaatt! What, what! Kyle, you open this door right now. [starts to pound her fist on pantry door]
Kyle
Ma. Mom, we are really sorry...
Sheila
[yelling] Open this door! [continues pounding on the door]
Kyle
But Ike and I have to do something and we have to be able to use the computers
Sheila
[yelling] What,what?! No computers! Do not touch the computers! [continues pounding on the door]
Kyle
We have to do this, Mom. Its the only thing that can save our family now.
Sheila
[continues pounding on the door] You are done! You hear me?! You are both done! [screams]
End of Not Funny

The End of Serialization as We Know It
The Pentagon, President-Elect Garrison is approached by two members of the military.
General Revaur
Mr. President? Russians are scrambling bombers to attack Denmark. NATO wants to know how we intend to stop them. Mr. President?...Mr. President you can't just sit there with your "stank face".
Mr. Garrison
Iah-uhk-uh-I cain't?
Military Officer
The TrollTrace website is set to go online in less than fifteen minutes, the world is in complete chaos!
NSA Agent
[From a nearby workstation.] Sir, someone is leading a coordinated cyber strike on the TrollTrace website.
Mr. Garrison
[Joyously.] A cyber attack, well that's good! Where's it comin' from?
NSA Agent
It could be Russian, we don't know. Whoever this troll is, he's pretty fucking hardcore sir.
Broflovski Residence. Kyle sits in Gerald's office typing away, a can of Sprite nearby. "Smokin'" by the rock band "Boston" plays loudly.
Kyle
Okay, okay, Token? Token are you there?
Token pops up in a Skype window on the computer.
Token
I'm here, what's this about Kyle?
Kyle
I can't tell you dude, I just need your
Smokin'

help...Please, my life depends
Smokin'

on it.
Token
Okay, okay sure.
I feel alright, mamma...

Kyle
Alright,
I'm not jokin', yeah

I need you to tell me the worst thing I can say on the United Negro College Fund website to piss off black people.
Token
What!?
Kyle
Token, please! There's no time to explain!
Token
Beyonce ain't nothin' but a Taylor Swift ripoff.
Kyle
That helps thank you.
Kyle closes Token's window and brings up Craig and Tweek.
Kyle
Tweek, Craig, I need you to get on the GLAAD website and respond to all the horrible shit I just said about gay people.
Craig
Why'd you say horrible shit about gay people?
Kyle
It's not important, just get on it and respond.
A popup appears, Stan Marsh is ringing Kyle on Skype. Kyle closes, Tweek and Craig, and brings Stan up.
Kyle
[To Tweek & Craig.] Hang on. [To Stan.] Stan! Finally. Dude I need everybody online now!
Stan
For what?
Kyle
Dude, there's no time to explain, you gotta go out and get everybody, tell them to get on their computers, go!
Stan
[Pumped up] Okay!
Kyle closes Stan's window and brings up Jimmy Valmer.
Kyle
Jimmy, what's the worst possible thing you could say on a website for handicapped Syrian refugees?
Jimmy
Wuh-Wuh-Waddle back to Syria you desert-tard. [Jimmy smiles gleefully]
A door is nailed shut by numerous pieces of wood and the door handle is wedged securely with a chair. On the other side, someone is trapped, jostling the handle and shaking the door.
Sheila
You boys...better not be on that computaaaaaaah! I'll make you pay for this. You locked your mother in the pantry? I'll lock you in your rooms forevaaah.
TrollTrace Headquarters. Gerald is locked in the conference room. Risk Astley is still blaring over the large television.
Never gonna give, never gonna give, give you up
Never gonna give, never gonna give, give you up
We've known each other,

Static interrupts the song.

for so long

Static interrupts again and Dildo Shwaggins is seen.

Dildo Shwaggins
Skank
Gerald
Dildo?
Dildo Shwaggins
Skankhunt, can you hear me?
Gerald
Yes! Yes, where are you?
Dildo Shwaggins
The troll locked us in the control room with his Danish workers.
Gerald
How long before the website goes online?
Danish Worker
Less than ten mienutes.
Gerald
Oh God!
Dildo Shwaggins
Skankhunt! The TrollTrace servers monitor and catalog outrage and hate on the internet, there's a troll out there trying to overload them by generating tons of hate.
Dildo Shwaggins
Skank, whoever's doing it is doing it from your account.
Gerald
My account?
Dildo Shwaggins
Yeah, he's pissing off a lot of people.
Gerald realizes that Kyle is using his account to help save him.
Gerald
[Proudly.] That's my boy!
Back at SpaceX, Heidi, Elon Musk and some SpaceX employees look at a chamber containing fast flowing energy.
Female SpaceX Worker
The core energy is completely stable, and very easy to reduce. It's the most massive energy source of its size we've ever seen.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
We've done it Elon, with this type of energy we can easily get mankind to Mars.
Elon Musk
This is amazing! And it's all thanks to you little girl, how did you get to be so smart?
Heidi
I just-- have a boyfriend who really supports me.
She looks over to where Cartman is and waves. Cartman half-heartedly waves back.
Elon Musk
Well, c'mon, I wanna know everything about you.
She and Elon Musk walk off, Cartman stands next to Butters with a troubled look on his face.
Cartman
Conniving, snakes-in-the-grass. All of them.
Butters
Yep.
Cartman
We have to tell someone the truth, Butters.
Butters
Are you sure about what's going to happen on Mars.
Cartman
It's all been leading up to this, we've just been too blind to see it before.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
Hey, you guys need anything? Water, Soda?
Cartman
Maybe just a moment alone, to talk?
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
Sure, about what?
Cartman
The end of our species.
Back in Gerald's office in Kyle's house.
Kyle
All right, who else we got now, Kevin are you there, Kenny?
Kevin
Ye-I, I typed in everything you told me to.
Kenny
(Me too dude, what's next?)
Ike pops up in a window.
Ike
Kyle, I wanna help tooo.
Kyle
No, Ike. So far the only thing you've done is from dad's account, we need you to stay clean. No trolling, Okay!? You can just help me with what I should say.
Dildo Shwaggins pops up in a window.
Dildo Shwaggins
Hello? Can you hear me? This is Dildo Shwaggins.
Kyle
Who are you?
Dildo Shwaggins
I'm a colleague of your fathers. We see what you're trying to do, and we're gonna help, we trolled with your father, now we will troll with you.
Kyle
O-- Okay?
Dildo Shwaggins
Son, you need to know that your father is very proud of you. He was the best at Trevor's Axiom, he believes you can be too.
Kyle
What the hell is "Trevor's Axiom"?
An NSA Agent stands next to a dry-erase board with a pointer. On the board reads "Trevor's Axiom" under which is a tree of circled letters, breaking off into tiers, representing users.
NSA Agent
Trevor's Axiom is a well-known equation in online trolling.
The people the NSA Agent is talking to are shown, seated at the table are President-Elect Garrison, sporting his "Stank-Face", some NSA Agents, General Revaur, and his associate.
NSA Agent
It's a way in which one person can create a massive reaction on the Internet. Look, person A trolls person B, but it's not about person B, the troll is trying to push buttons to try and get a reaction from hundreds, eventually creating person C, whose overreaction and self righteousness will elicit a reaction from persons D through F, who weren't trolls but can't help rip on person C.
NSA Agent
Their reactions lead to outrage persons G through N, and it keeps going, generating massive energy, it's like the fission reaction that leads to a fusion explosion, all bringing out the worst in humanity.
Mr. Garrison
Huh, that sorta sounds like how I got elected.
NSA Agent
Precisely, Mr. President, and if this kind of overreaction can be amplified through the Pentagon servers...
General Revaur
[Interrupting] It could blow up the Internet before TrollTrace ever does substantial damage.
Mr. Garrison
Gentlemen, get me in contact with that troll.
SpaceX: Interior. Cartman and Butters are sitting at a table across from the male #OccupyMars SpaceX worker
Cartman
Listen, there isn't much time. This whole thing has to be stopped. We can't go to Mars.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
You keep saying that, but not why.
Butters
Because Eric knows the future.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
What are you talking about?
Cartman
I've had visions of Mars for the past few months. I'm a visionary. That's why I came, why I brought her.
He hops off the chair and walks to the other side of the room.
Cartman
But the visions weren't complete until recently. I know what happens on Mars.
Cartman has a vision, and the red surface of Mars is now shown, as he dictates his vision.
Cartman (Voiceover)
At first, you'll be super-happy, bouncing around the red sand.
Cartman is is in a spacesuit, jumping around saying "Cool".
Cartman
Everyone will be really nice.
Cartman jumps down from a small hill and notices a futuristic structure with some female astronauts nearby. They both wave to Cartman as he hops past the structure.
Female 1
Hi!
Female 2
Hi!
Cartman
Hi!
Cartman reaches the bottom of the hill as a rover drives past him.
Cartman
You'll think the rover cars and roller coasters are really cool.
The rover is now driving towards a futuristic amusement park.
Cartman
But then, you'll realize something--The other colonists all seem to be women.
Cartman looks around and notices a parked rover with 4 women smiling and waving to him.
Cartman
Hmm, let's see
Cartman hops in their direction.
Cartman
And then you'll start to wonder, "Where are all the other guys?"
He quickly hops past a group of girls and young women. An image of Butters' head in a space helmet zooms past Cartman. Butters voice is heard.
Butters
[Whispering] Look underground.
Butter's voice echoes as Cartman hops toward an underground mine entrance.
Cartman
And soon, you'll realize there's areas you didn't understand the purpose for.
Cartman stops and examines the entrance, then proceeds inside.
Cartman
What is this place?
Cartman
And that's when you'll learn the truth...
A chamber unfolds in front of Cartman, it is filled with exhausted, naked men who have hoses attached to their penises. Each of them are standing in front of a station housing a reservoir of their semen and a laptop computer resides in front of each of them.
Cartman
Men have been forced underground, deemed useless by women.
The naked men are struggling to type on their laptops while being drained of their semen.
Cartman
They are mined for the only things women still need us for, our semen, and our jokes.
Cartman continues watching, as two women come up from behind, and grab him.
Cartman
What?! No, no!
One of the women removes Cartman's helmet.
Cartman
You're just as funny as us! You don't need to do this!
Soon, Cartman has been stripped of his clothes and is now naked, attached to a station.
Cartman
Nooooooo! No, no!
A woman in a spacesuit is standing behind him, yelling at him.
Female 3
Write jokes!
Cartman starts typing on the laptop, wimpering.
Cartman
No! No!
SpaceX: Interior. Cartman's vision ends.
Cartman
And you'll be trapped down there forever, in the cum and joke mines of Mars.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
That's, That's ridiculous. Why would women need us to do that? They're just as funny as men.
Cartman
If there's even a little part of you that really doesn't believe that, then think about what else has to be going on.
They all look up at two female SpaceX employees that walk by. The girls stop and notice the guys staring at them.
Female SpaceX Employee
What?
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
What?
Cartman hops back on chair, whispering.
Cartman
You have to help us stop this!
TrollTrace:Conference Room. Gerald is trying different access codes to open the door, but is consistently rejected
Gerald
[Frustrated.] Ah! God damn it!
Dildo Shwaggins
Skank! You still there?
Gerald
[He walks over to the TV.] Yeah, I'm here.
TrollTrace:Assembly Hall. Dildo Shwaggins is sitting at a computer with the rest of the trolls and TrollTrace staff
Dildo Shwaggins
The servers are starting to heat up, but the Danish say there are breakers that will never let them overload. You got to climb up the building and shut off the breakers.
Gerald
[He looks up at the monito.r] I can't go anywhere. I'm locked in the conference room.
TrollTrace employee
Oh, the key code to the conference room is 9...
Gerald
[He runs over to the panel and presses 9.] Yeah...?
TrollTrace employee
That's it. 9.
Gerald
[Frustrated.] Oh, for fuck's sake! [The panel light turns green, the door opens, and Gerald runs out.]
Broflovski Residence. Sheila is still trying to break open the kitchen pantry door.
Sheila
[She's pounding the door.] Kyle! You better run if I get out of here! You better pray that--[The chair moves and she is begins to pry open the door with her hands.]-ah!
Sheila eventually break the kitchen pantry door with her bodyweight. She comes out looking disheveled and breathing heavily, before yelling in frustration.
TrollTrace:Locker Room. Gerald runs in and stops at a locker to grab a uniform. He then proceeds up the ladder in the server room
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank. Skankhunt, are you there yet?
Gerald
Yeah, I'm up with all the servers.
TrollTrace:Assembly Hall. Dildo Shwaggins is sitting at a computer with the rest of the trolls and TrollTrace staff
TrollTrace employee
The first breaker should be there. Tell him to look for a large red lever.
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, do you see a large red lever?
Gerald
[notices the lever] Yeah, I got it [grabs the lever]
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] Flip it off
Gerald pulls the lever down, causing an alarm to go off.
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] That's good. Keep going Skankhunt.
Ike's room. Ike is on the computer with a headset.
Ike
You are all dumbass fuckwads.
An angry Sheila starts to slowly come up to Ike's door and then into his room
Ike
Lick my asshole, you Mexican bitch.
Sheila
Ike!
Ike
Aah!
Sheila
[Yelling.] You dare lock me in the pantry, so you can play on your computer?!
Sheila charges at Ike, but he manages to slide and crawl under her nightgown. She then grabs his computer monitor and slams it down
Ike
Mommy!
Sheila
[Yelling.] You're gonna pay for what you've done!
Ike
Aah! [He runs out into the hallway.]
Sheila follows Ike into the hallway and starts screaming
Gerald's office. Kyle is typing on the computer just as Ike pushes the door open
Ike
Kyle!
Sheila
Ike!
Kyle
[He throws down headset.] Shit!
Ike
Mommy got out!
Kyle gets off the chair and tries to shield Ike from Sheila
Sheila
[Panting.] You...! You helped turned your brother this way!
Kyle
Mom, there's been a mistake. Ike isn't the school troll. We're trying to help--
Sheila
Shut up! Not another word from either of you! You're both grounded from the computer...forever!
Sheila charges at the boys, but Kyle and Ike side step her and move towards the window.
Kyle
Mom, please, you got to listen to me. Ike is innocent
Sheila
[Yelling.] Do you think I'm stupid?!
Kyle
No, Mom. You just don't know everything. [Kyle straps a vest around his chest.]
Sheila
You both march out of here, right now!
Kyle
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm just trying to protect my family
Kyle grabs Ike and pulls the ripcord on his vests, launching both of them out the window. Sheila then runs over to the window and looks on in shock.
SpaceX:Exterior. A large group of people are making noise outside the entrance.
SpaceX:Interior. The Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker is walking alongside Elon Musk.
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
Look, Elon, I'm just saying before we go any further, you might want to hear this kid out. [They both stop in front of Cartman and Butters.]
Male #Occupy Mars SpaceX Worker
Go on, tell Elon.
Cartman
Elon, I know you've dreamt of mankind getting to Mars, but its not going to be very kind to man. They're going to put us underground.
Elon Musk
For what?
Cartman
What's the one thing women don't have? Semen and a sense of humor.
Elon Musk
That's two things.
Cartman
They're pretty related.
Elon Musk
Women don't need us for comedy. They can be just as funny as men. You should meet my girlfriend. She's really smart and really funny.
Cartman
Oh, Elon. Oh, Christ, Elon.
Butters
I used to think women were funny, too, but Eric talked me out of it.
Cartman
It's something they do to our brains. They attract us like flies to the spiderweb. And then they make you think they're really smart, really funny. But they're only really smart, Elon.
Cartman turns around and notices Heidi looking at him through the glass partition.
Cartman
They can live without us. We can't live without them.
Heidi waves to Cartman and he waves to her with a smile. She then walks away
Cartman
If even 1/16th of you believes that women might not be as funny as men, Elon--[He turns around and notices that Elon isn't there.] Elon?
Copy and Print: Exterior. Kyle and Ike are inside, with Kyle trolling on the computer.
Kyle
Why don't you kill yourself? Trust me, no one will care.
Ike
You fat hooker.
Kyle
You fat hooker. Ike, when this is all over, we're gonna need to clean your mouth out.
Ike
You clean your fucking mouth out.
Stan pops up on a FaceTime window
Kyle
Stan! You still haven't found Butters yet? Dude, I need his hatred towards women right now!
Stan
Dude, he's not around anywhere. He must be out of town.
Kyle
Shit!
A FaceTime notification from "The President" pops up
Kyle
Hold on...
Mr. Garrison pops up on a FaceTime window.
Mr. Garrison
Kyle?!
Kyle
[Surprised.] Oh, hey, Mr. President
Mr. Garrison
Kyle, you're the troll who started all this?!
Kyle
Uh...what do you mean?
Mr. Garrison
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. So long as you keep doing what you're doing. The American government is behind you.
Kyle
[Surprised.] It is?
Mr. Garrison
Keep up the good work. We're gonna take that big shitstorm of hate you're creating and amplify it. We'll try to create enough energy to blow up the whole fucking internet. [He gives Kyle a military salute] You're doing God's work, son. Keep it up.
Kyle
[He gives Mr. Garrison a half-hearted military salute.] Thanks?
The skies of Denmark. Tjing Tjang Tjing is heard as Lennart Bedrager is flying a helicopter with a grin on his face. As he looks at his phone, his expression changes into shock as he sees video of Gerald shutting down the servers.
Bedrager
Oh, no, you don't.
Bedrager turns the helicopter around and heads back to the TrollTrace building.
South Park: Residential neighborhood. People are panicking and running around on the streets. Sheila walks up to the Tucker residence and knocks on the door.
Sheila
Laura, have my boys come to see Craig? They're hiding from me.
Laura is sobbing.
Sheila
What? What? What?
Laura
[She wipes her nose with a tissue.] The son of a bitch. He's such a bastard.
Laura walks away from the door into the living room. A confused Sheila follows her into the house
Laura
When you marry someone and you think you know them...
Sheila
I don't know what you're talking about.
Laura
TrollTrace. Its up and running. [She points to the laptop sitting on the table.]
Laura
It can tell you anybody's Internet history. [She starts to walk to her couch.]
Laura
I couldn't resist. I looked up my husband. [Sheila approaches the laptop.] The websites he's visited are just...disgusting!
Sheila
May I use this a moment?
Laura
Sure. Type in any name. It'll show you everything they've ever done online. Be careful. You might not like what you see.
Sheila takes a seat and accesses The TrollTrace website. She starts to type in Ike's name and all his personal information. A detailed list of websites with date and time stamps appears in front of her. She starts to scroll down the list and is shocked at what she sees.
SpaceX:Exterior. A large group of people are making noise outside the entrance.
SpaceX:Interior. Butters is standing around while Cartman is nervously pacing back and forth.
Cartman
What the hell am I going to do, Butters? Semen and a sense of humor. I can't live without Heidi. I know I'll be miserable. But I also can't live on the cum and joke mines of Mars.
Butters
Gee, I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
Cartman
If I stay on Earth where the internet is, Heidi finds out I know women aren't actually funny. And if I go to Mars, I get milked like a goat.
Butters' phone rings and he becomes mad as he answers it.
Butters
What?!
Kyle
Butters! Where the fuck are you?!
Butters
Oh, I'm at SpaceX. Where are you?
Kyle
SpaceX? Why?!
Butters
Well, we sort of created this ginormic energy source, but now, we're trying to figure out what to do with it.
Kyle
[He swivels his chair around.] Like...how ginormic of an energy source?
Butters
Like enough to get humanity to Mars.
Cartman
[He is heard over Kyle's phone.] Is that Kyle?
Cartman
[He takes Butters' phone.] Kyle, do you mind? I'm having really big girl problems right now.
Kyle
Cartman, I think we might be able to help each other.
TrollTrace:Server Room. Gerald is moving up another ladder in the server room
Dildo Shwaggins
[He speaks over P.A. system.] Skank, there's no more time! Have you found the last breaker?
Gerald is at the last walkway and is staring at a path leading to a mechanical door.
Gerald
I think so. I-I'm up on some kind of bridgeway.
TrollTrace employee
That last breaker should be there
Gerald
Heading to it now!
Gerald begins to sprint across the bridgeway, but stops as he sees the figure of Lennart Bedrager standing at the door.
Bedrager
I'm ten steps ahead of you!
Gerald is in shock, as Lennart Bedrager emerges from the shadows with a gun pointed at him.
Bedrager
What's the matter Skankhunt? You just can't stand to be outdone, huh?
The TrollTrace server room is starting to fall apart
Gerald
Get out of my way. What you're doing is wrong!
Bedrager
What I'm doing is wrong? How is getting millions of people to kill themselves different from getting one person to?
Gerald
It's completely heartless and malicious!
Bedrager
You can honestly stand there, as a troll, and tell me that what I'm doing isn't hilarious?
Gerald
No! Its not! Hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isn't even technically satirical.
Bedrager
How is not satirical?
The TrollTrace server room continues to fall apart, causing explosions and flying debris, as the bridgway starts to shake, knocking both of them back.
Tucker residence: Living room. As Laura looks out the window, Sheila is still in shock at the TrollTrace results she's looking at.
Sheila
There's nothing here.
The TrollTrace results for Ike continue to scroll before finally stopping.
Sheila
Maybe Kyle was telling the truth. [She gets off of chair and walks towards Laura.]
Sheila
Oh Laura! I think my boys were being honest with me.
Laura
About what?
Sheila
I accused Ike of...of...well, I can't really say, but this thing says that he's clean. I got to find my boys, Laura. Thank you so much. [She approaches the front door.]
Laura
Its not our kids we have to be worried about. [Sheila stops and turns to her.]
Laura
My husband was on three "married-but-dating" websites! He looked at porn 4,000 times in one month! Aren't you curious about what your husband does? Huh? Sure he doesn't have any girlfriends?
Sheila thinks about Laura's question while looking at the TrollTrace website on the laptop.
Sheila
No, I-I have to respect Gerald's privacy.
Laura
Sure, yeah. Respect. Nice of you to give him that. [She walks toward the laptop.]
Laura
Come on, you really think you can resist the urge to type in his name...just for a quick little look?
The Pentagon: Diplomatic Strategy room. One employee who is on fire runs across the room unnoticed by the staff. Two NSA agents are typing while Mr. Garrison and the Army generals stand near them
NSA Agent
There's nothing more we can do. Nearly everyone is online and we diverted all the power we can.
Army General 2
Mr. President, TrollTrace has been online for almost 15 minutes now. Its too late. We need to get you down to the bunker.
Mr. Garrison
Oh I got a bunker? Well that's good.
Soldier
[He holds the red telephone.] Mr. President, we have an urgent call from Kyle.
Mr. Garrison
[He picks up the phone.] Sorry, Kyle. Looks like its not going to work.
Kyle
[He types on his computer.] Mr. Garrison, I might have just found a lot more energy. Is there anyway the Pentagon can connect to SpaceX?
Mr. Garrison
SpaceX? What the fuck is that?
Kyle
[He types on his computer.] You know, the company trying to find new forms of energy, create jobs and get mankind to Mars.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, that's dumb, but go on.
TrollTrace: Server room. The rooms continues to fall apart while Gerald and Lennart try to keep their balance as the bridegway starts to shake from the explosions.
Gerald
Okay, okay, look. What you're doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny?
Bedrager
That's not what I'm doing. I'm showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn't even matter.
Gerald
No, but see, that's just nihilism.
Bedrager
Oh, come on!
Gerald
That is!
Bedrager
So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you're a satirist, but if you're cynical about it, then you're a nihilist? That's fucking ridiculous!
Another explosion causes them to try and regain their balance again.
Gerald
You're trying to get people to go to war and kill each other.
Bedrager
So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire.
Another explosion causes them to move back slightly and keep their balance
SpaceX: Assembly line. An alarm goes off as Cartman speaks over the P.A. system.
Cartman
Attention all SpaceX employees. [Elon Musk and his group turn away from the energy source chamber and look up.]
Cartman
Please evacuate the building immediately. [A group of men working on Tesla cars stop and hear the announcement.]
Cartman
We just received a bomb threat from NASA. This is not a drill. [Heidi walks over to Cartman from behind.]
Cartman
The NASA terrorists are super-jelly of us. Please quietly and calmly find the nearest exit and get the fuck out as fast as you can. [He notices Heidi.] Ah! [He puts the microphone away.] Oh, hey, babe. Wh-What's up?
Heidi
There's a bomb threat?
Cartman
Oh yeah, I was just...They told me on the stifernisy thing. It was spinning. Come on, we better get out. [He grabs Heidi and runs with her to the energy source chamber before she stops him.]
Heidi
Babe, is everything okay? You seem...distantly lately.
As Cartman starts talking, Butters and the male #OccupyMars SpaceX employee look on while bringing a large yellow hose to the chamber
Cartman
Distant? Really? Oh my God. I-I'm sorry.
Heidi
Did I do something wrong?
Cartman
[He grabs Heidi's hands.] No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? [He then turns her away, so she doesn't see what's going on with the chamber.]
Heidi
You don't really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I'm sounding needy, huh?
Cartman
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on.
As Heidi starts talking, Cartman focuses on Butters and the male #OccupyMars SpaceX employee who has attached the hose to one of the chamber's valve and making adjustments.
Heidi
Eric, I just--I hope that you're always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings.
Cartman
Uh-huh. Yeah, cool. Heidi, I'll always do what's best both of us. [He puts his arm around her while looking back at the guys.]
Cartman
Now come on we got to get outside.
Tucker residence. The TrollTrace website is seen as Sheila hesitates about entering Gerald's information. She then begins to slowly type his name in
Sheila
I shouldn't do this.
TrollTrace: Server room. Gerald has his back turned to Lennart Bedrager
Gerald
I can't argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true. [He turns around.]
Gerald
All we've been doing is making excuses for being horrible people. [Bedrager looks down, agreeing with Gerald.]
Gerald
I don't know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have. [He slowly shuffles forward towards Bedrager.]
Gerald
I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself. [He stops a few inches from Bedrager.] With only one minor difference.
Gerald hops forward and kicks Lennart Bedrager between his legs, causing him to drop down in pain. Gerald then grabs him by his jacket and tosses him off the bridgeway.
Bedrager
Noooooo!!!
Gerald
Ha! Fuck you! What I do is fucking funny, bitch!
Gerald then moves towards the final lever and pulls it down, causing an alarm to go off.
Copy and Print. Dildo Shwaggins is FaceTiming with Kyle and Ike
Dildo Shwaggins
That's it. Your dad's got it. Give it everything you got!
Kyle
Mr. President, do it!
Mr. Garrison
Reroute the internet through SpaceX!.
Pentagon Employee
Rerouting now!
SpaceX: Interior. The chamber begins to violently shake and beep, eventually exploding and sending a massive fireball throughout the entire SpaceX factory.
Tucker residence. Sheila has typed in all of Gerald's information and slowly presses the "Return" key to start the search. As the results start to compile, the screen starts to flicker and then the screen shuts down. The shutdown then proceeds to Copy and Print, TrollTrace and the Pentagon, leaving everyone with a black screen that reads "Internet Reset Global Cache Cleared F:\>"
Sheila
[She stares at the black screen.] What the hell just happened?!
SpaceX: Exterior. The entire SpaceX building is exploding and everyone is running away. From a hill, Elon Musk and a few SpaceX employees are watching in horror, along with Cartman, Heidi and Butters.
Cartman
Well, looks like you're gonna have to kind of start over, huh, Elon?.
Elon is oblivious to Cartman's remark as he continues watching SpaceX explode in front of him.
Cartman
Maybe you should just go back to your little cars, huh?
Heidi
Wow, babe. Looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while, huh?
Cartman
Yeah, well some people's dreams are other people's nightmares.
Heidi
Well, what do you mean?
Cartman
It was a joke.
South Park: Residential area. The Stotch residence is shown, with Stephen and Linda Stotch opening the door and looking up to the sky. Kyle starts narrating.
Kyle (voiceover)
And so, life goes on.
South Park: The Tweak residence. Tweak and his parents step outside their house.
Kyle (voiceover)
The end of civilization didn't happen.
South Park: Residential area. A large group of residents, including Thomas and Linda Tucker and Richard Alder, are stepping outside, looking around, talking to each other, shaking hands and giving each other hugs.
Kyle (voiceover)
A massive electrical pulse completely erased the internet.
South Park: Residential area. Broflovski residence. A taxi pulls up to the curb with Gerald inside.
Kyle (voiceover)
We've been given a second chance.
Gerald exits the taxi and makes his way to the front door. He open the door and steps inside into the living room
Kyle (voiceover)
A mulligan.
Ike and Kyle look on as Sheila quickly runs over and gives him a hug.
Kyle (voiceover)
Anything we might be ashamed of, gone forever.
Ike and Kyle angrily stare at Gerald. He smiles at them and gives them a thumbs-up. Kyle's expression then changes into annoyance.
South Park: Bus Stop. A large bus pulls up to its next stop.
Kyle (voiceover)
Maybe now boys and girls can learn to respect each other again.
The bus comes to a stop and opens its door. Two adults, followed by Heidi and Cartman step off the bus. Heidi smiles at Cartman but Cartman looks at her with mistrust.
South Park: The Turner residence. Cartman and Heidi are walking together, holding hands, while Mr. and Mrs. Turner look on from their front door
