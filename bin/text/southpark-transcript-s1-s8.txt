Boys
School day, school day, teacher's golden ru...
Kyle Broflovski
Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
Ike Broflovski
Zeeponaner.
Kyle
Ike, you can't come to school with me. [Ike Chortles.]
Eric Cartman
Yeah, go home you little dildo!
Kyle
Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!
Stan Marsh
What's a dildo?
Kyle
Well, I don't know...[He faces Cartman and points at him.] and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
Cartman
I know what it means!
Kyle
Well, what?
Cartman
I'm not telling you.
Stan
What's a dildo, Kenny?
Kenny McCormick
(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina.) [The others laugh.]
Cartman
He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right! [Kyle swings Ike by his feet, knocking Cartman down.] Ow! [Ike Laughs.]
Stan
Dude, that kicks ass!
Kyle
Yeah, check this one out. Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
Ike
Don't kick the baby.
Kyle
Kick the baby.
He kicks Ike like a football, who lands, knocking down four mailboxes. Cartman yawns.
Stan
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Cartman
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Kyle
Really? What about?
Cartman
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...
The dream sequence begins.
Cartman
...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.
Through his window, one can see a spaceship land and its light stream in.
Cartman
Then slowly my bedroom door began to open... [A Visitor peeks inside.]
Cartman
...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.
Cartman
Weeaak!
Cartman
Then I was lying on a table...
Cartman is laying face down, Visitors lower his pajamas.
Cartman
...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
Stan
Dude! Visitors!
Kyle
Totally!
Cartman
What?
Stan
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were Visitors!
Cartman
No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
Stan
Visitors are real.
Kyle
Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
Cartman
Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.
Chef
[Drives up and gets out of the car.] Hello there, children.
Boys
Hey, Chef.
Stan
What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
Chef
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.
Cartman
Kick ass.
Chef
Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
Cartman
[Surprised.] Huh?
Kyle
Yeah, fat boy saw it!
Cartman
Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!
Chef
Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
Cartman
Oh!
Stan
They took him on their ship.
Chef
Oh! [Quietly.] Did they give you an anal probe?
Cartman
Oh!
Kyle
What's an anal probe?
Chef
That's when they put this big metal hoop-a-joop up yo' butt.
Kyle
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Cartman
No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?
Stan
Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
Cartman
No!
Ike
Eneh probe.
Cartman
Shut up, dildo!
Chef
Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control.
Chef walks back to his car, there is a picture of a Visitor on his shirt with the word "Believe" written under it. Cartman goes catatonic as Chef drives off.
Cartman
Oh!
Kyle
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
Cartman
God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
They start to file onto the bus.
Kyle
Why you walkin' so funny Cartman?
Cartman
Shut up!
Ike
[Waddles by.] Oh foonuh bebe.
Kyle
No, Ike, go home.
Ike
Eeeeee!
Kyle
This is it. This one's for the game.
Ike
Purplor.
Kyle
Kick the baby!
He kicks Ike, who flies through the first window of the school bus and crashes out the window on the other side.
On the bus.
Stan
Good morning, Miss Crabtree.
Ms. Veronica Crabtree
Sit down! We're runnin' late!
The bus pulls away, leaving Ike behind at the bus stop. Kyle is kneeling on the seat looking out the back window at him.
Kyle
Damn it, he's still there.
Stan
Oh, don't worry about him.
Kyle
No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
Ms. Crabtree
Sit down back there! Arrrggghhh!!
Stan
Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.
Ms. Crabtree
What did you say!?
Stan
I said I have a bad itch.
Ms. Crabtree
Oh.
Kyle
[Gasps.] Oh, my God!
Two Visitors are holding Ike between them
Stan
[Turning to see.] Visitors!
Kenny
(Oh nooo!)
Kyle
Ike! [Kyle runs to the front of the bus.] Stop the bus! Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!
Ms. Crabtree
Do you want an office referral!?
Kyle
No.
Ms. Crabtree
Then sit down!
Kyle
But I...
Ms. Crabtree
Arrgghhh!
Kyle
Arrghh!
Kyle, Ms. Crabtree
Arrrggghhh!
Kyle runs back to his seat. Ms. Crabtree has the last word.
Stan
Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw?
Cartman
Shut up you guys, it's not working.
Kyle
We have to do something!
Stan
Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
Ms. Crabtree
What did you say!?
Stan
Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
Ms. Crabtree
Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do.
she makes a hard right, flinging kids onto the left side of the bus.
Kyle
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Stan farts.] You farted. [They laugh.]
Cartman
Heh, somebody's baking brownies.
Behind the bus, a space craft rises into the sky, then zooms away.
Farmer's grazing fields with a mutilated cow.
Farmer Carl Denkins
That's the third cow this month. At this rate all my cattle are gonna die before the winter's through.
The cows moo questioningly.
Officer Barbrady
This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time.
The cows shake their heads.
Farmer Carl
People been saying they've been seeing UFO's around.
Officer Barbrady
UFO's? [Laughs.]
Farmer Carl
Yeah, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks.
Officer Barbrady
That is the silliest thing I've ever heard.
Helicopters fly by above him.
Farmer Carl
What was that?
Officer Barbrady
That, that was a pigeon.
Farmer Carl
What am I supposed to do, Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one?
The cows notice something and raise their heads. One Visitor waves a piece of hay and whistles. The cows start running away from them.
Farmer Carl
Hey! My cattle!
The "Cattle Ranch" sign falls down.
Farmer Carl
You see? There is somethin' funny goin' on!
Officer Barbrady
There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
Mr. Garrison's class.
Mr. Herbert Garrison
And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus.
Mr. Hat
That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492 Columbus started a restaurant...[He is drowned out by Kyle's voice.]
Kyle
[Whispering.] Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"
Stan
[Whispering.] Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
Kyle
[His voice is rising to an audible level.] "You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?"
Stan
Dude!
Mr. Garrison
Is there a problem, boys?
Kyle
Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?
Kyle
No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Silence.] It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
Cartman
[Embarrassed.] Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh.
Kyle
[Kyle walks up to Mr. Garrison's desk.] Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
Mr. Garrison
I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?
Kyle
I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
Mr. Garrison
Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
Kyle
Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
Mr. Hat
Well, Kyle, no!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Mr. Garrison
Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle.
Kyle
Damn it!
Cartman
Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.
Cartman farts fire. Poor Pip is stunned.
Cartman
Ow! My ass!
The class gasps.
Kyle
Dude!
Stan
Damn, Cartman!
Cartman
[Cartman farts fire again.] Uh... Ow! My ass!
Kyle
Dude, he's farting fire!
Stan
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
Cartman
No, that was just a dream.
Mr. Garrison
Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?
Cartman
No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.
Cartman farts fire again, setting Pip aflame. Pip runs around the room on fire.
Train station. Cows flock in from all around and stand in line, waiting to board the train out of town.
Train Conductor
Hey, you cows can't get on this train! This is a people train. You cows have no business on a people train, all right? 'Cause you're cows.
The cows are all staring at the conductor.
Train Conductor
No, no, no. Don't try any of that cow hypnosis on me, all right? 'Cause it's not gonna work.
Officer Barbrady
[Drives by with his lights flashing.] Hold it right there, cows!
Cows split up and run off mooing.
Officer Barbrady
Come back here! Now then! [He pursues them.]
Cafeteria
Kid
So then I had bad, bad gas.
Jason
Ya, seriously, killer.
Cartman
[Cartman farts fire.] Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry.
Stan
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Cartman
Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.
Kyle
Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.
Stan
[Gasps.] Where?
He finds himself looking right at her. An epiphany plays while hearts dance around Stan's head. Stan smiles, and it soon goes from ear to ear
Cartman
[Singing.] Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger.
Stan
Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
Cartman
I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
Stan
I do not!
Wendy Testaburger
Hi, guys.
Kyle, Cartman
Hi, Wendy.
Wendy
Here, Stan. This is for you. [Wendy hands Stan a note.]
Stan
Bleech!
Wendy
Eww! [She leaves.]
Kyle, Cartman
[Their eyes follow her out.] Bye, Wendy.
Kyle
Dude, what does the note say?
Stan
[He glances at it.] Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.
A look of wonder comes over his face.
Kyle
Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
Cartman
Or slip her the tongue.
Kenny
(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)
Stan
[That gets his attention.] What? How do you know she has a cat?
Silence, Kenny waits to see if the other guys got the message, then laughs. The rest follow, realizing what Kenny meant.
Kyle
Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
The cafeteria kitchen. Chef stands behind the counter, ready to serve food. The boys enter.
Chef
Hello there, children.
Boys
Hey, Chef.
Chef
How are you doing?
Kyle
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Kyle
Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
Chef
Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to you woman
Gonna lay you down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make you moan and perspire
Gonna--

Stan
Uh, Chef.
Chef
--get those juices flowin'--

Stan
Chef.
Chef
--we're makin' love gravy--

Stan
Chef!
Chef
--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!

Stan
CHEF!!
Chef
Love luh--

Huh?
Silence. Kenny nods towards Kyle.
Chef
Do you feel better?
Kyle
No!
Chef
Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.
Stan
Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
Chef
What?!
Chef tosses a food tray aside and runs to the other side of the counter.
Chef
What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!
Kyle
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
Cartman
You are making it up.
Cartman farts more fire, the anal probe pops out, moves around and puts its metal arms on its hip, looking annoyed at Cartman's determination that it didn't happen.
Stan
Whoa!
The probe goes back into Cartman's ass.
Cartman
What?
Kyle
That was cool!
Chef
It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.
Cartman turns about so Chef can check out the probe.
Chef
This could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us.
Cartman
[Turning to face Chef, testily.] Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?
Chef
It's no joke, children, this is big!
Kyle
Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
Chef
Uuh, hold on now, hold on now. [To himself.] Uhyouyouyou you gotta help the children.
Cartman
Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!
Chef
[Pulling on the fire alarm] Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out! [To the boys.] Okay children, this is your chance!
Stan
Killer! Thanks, Chef.
Chef
Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I've got to get myself ready.
The boys' neighborhood.
Boys
[Singing.]
We got out of school,
No more school today,
We got out of school...

Cartman, interrupting the song with a fiery fart.
Cartman
Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!
Stan
Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
Cartman
I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
Kyle
Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
Cartman
Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control!
a radio wave strikes Cartman and he gets big blushy cheeks and starts to sing.
Cartman
I love to singa,
About the moona and June-a and the springa,
I love to singa,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...

A second radio wave reverts him to normal and all is quiet. Dogs bark in the background.
Stan
What the hell was that?
Kyle
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors!
Cartman
Ah, son of a bitch!
Cartman
You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.
Kyle yells into Cartman's ear. His voice echoes.
Kyle
Hey!
Cartman
Uh...
Kyle
If you Visitors can hear me-
The voice echoes in Cartman's head.
Cartman
Hey...
Kyle
-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
Cartman
Ow! [Faces Kyle.] That hurts, you buttlicker!
Stan notices a spaceship hovering overhead.
Stan
Kyle, look! It's them.
Kyle
Give me back my brother!
Kyle throws a rock at the spaceship. It fires back with a flash of light, hitting Kenny and knocking him into the road.
Stan
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!
The spaceship leaves.
Kyle
Damn it, we were so close!
Stan
Hey look, [Kenny gets up.] I think Kenny's okay.
Kenny
(Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!)
The fleeing cows run over Kenny.
Stan
Owww.
Kenny
[He gets up again.] (Nope, I'm all fine. Agh!)
Officer Barbrady mows him down with his police cruiser. Kenny ends up along the curb, lifeless. The boys approach.
Stan
Wow, poor Kenny.
Kyle
Now do you believe us, Cartman?
Cartman
No!
Kyle
Cartman, they killed Kenny!
Cartman
He's not dead.
Stan
Dude, Kenny is dead!
Stan picks up a stick and hits Kenny's bloody body.
Stan
See?
Cartman
Shut up, you guys.
Kyle
He's dead, Cartman!
Kyle pulls Kenny's head off his body.
Cartman
God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe! [He walks off.] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.
Kyle
Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
Cartman
[Off screen.] Dildo!
Kyle
You're all I have left, Stan.
Stan
Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
Kyle
You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!
Rats feast upon Kenny's body.
Stan
Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. [He hurries away.]
Rats drag Kenny's head off.
Kyle
Rats.
Cartman's house.
Liane Cartman
Hello, Eric.
Cartman
Hi, Mom.
Liane
How are you doing?
Cartman
Well, I'm pissed off!
Liane
Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.
Cartman
I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
Liane
You're not fat, you're big boned.
Cartman
That's what I said.
Liane
You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?
Cartman
No!
Liane
Just a weensy eensy woo woo?
Cartman
No, leave me alone mom! [He walks past her.]
Liane
How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?
Cartman
[He stops in his tracks.] What? Well, that does sound pretty good.
He returns to sit on the sofa while his mom goes off to get the pie.
Cartman
Uh, Mom?
Liane
Yes, hon?
Cartman
If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?
Liane
Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?
Cartman is in disbelief she even asked.
Cartman
Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.
Stark's Pond. Kyle decided to join Stan.
Kyle
Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now.
Stan
But her note said she'd be here.
Wendy appears out of nowhere.
Wendy
Hi, Stan.
Stan
Bleech!
Wendy
Eww!
Kyle
You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
Wendy
But why, Stan?
Stan tries to hold it in.
Stan
Bleech!
Wendy
Eww!
Kyle
Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
Wendy
[Turns to Kyle.] Huh?
Kyle
Just make sweet love down by the fire.
Wendy
What happened to your little brother?
Cartman's house. Cartman is on the sofa watching TV.
News Reporter
As the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns.
A plane circles around a field with odd patterns on it, and a cameraman pans out to reveal the outline of Cartman.
Cartman
Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.
News Reporter
Could it be that aliens are trying to make contact with us, here on Earth?
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Noticing Mr. Kitty eyeing his pot pie.
Cartman
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!
Kitty hisses.
Cartman
Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
Liane peeks in suggestively.
Liane
Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.
Cartman
[Confused.] What?
Stark's Pond. Kyle is explaining what happened to his little brother.
Kyle
...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
Wendy
Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?
Kyle
Why?
Wendy
Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.
Kyle
Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. [He moves out.]
Wendy
Come on, Stan. [She walks past him, following Kyle.]
Stan
Bleech!
Wendy
Eww! [She walks away.]
Stan
Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?
A bird flies into his puke and starts waddling around in it.
Cartman's House, a short time later.
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, you can't have any!
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!
Cartman farts fire, setting the cat ablaze.
Cartman
Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty.
Liane enters the room with Kyle, Stan, and Wendy.
Liane
Eric, look who's here.
Cartman
Dude, weak mom.
Kyle
Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
Cartman
I can't, my mom said...
Liane
That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.
Cartman
[Quietly.] But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--
Liane
[Stern.] Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.
Cartman
God damn it!
Mr. Kitty then runs by in flames.
Forest at night. Cartman's right foot is tied to a tree.
Cartman
You guys, I have to get home.
Stan
Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
Cartman tugs his foot testing the rope.
Cartman
Oh, man, this sucks.
Kyle
How come the Visitors aren't coming for him?
Stan
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Cartman
[Cartman farts fire.] Ow!
Wendy
Hey, he's like Rudolph.
Kyle
Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come!
Cartman
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
Kyle
Sure you do!
Stan
Come on Cartman, fart!
Cartman
I don't wanna.
Stan
[To Kyle and Wendy.] He can't hold it in forever.
Kyle
Fart, damn you!
Cartman
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!
Farts. An anal probe comes out of his butt and expands.
Cartman
I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
Stan
Hey, it's happening again.
The probe is now a large satellite dish.
Kyle
Whoa, look at that.
Stan
Now, do you believe us, Cartman?
Cartman
You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
Stan
Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
Cartman
Sure, you guys, what-ever.
The dish sends a radio signal out to space.
Chef's yard. He's sitting in a lawn chair with a can of ZOOP in his hand. An Igloo cooler is next to him.
Chef
Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom! [He looks at his watch.] And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.
Forest.
Cartman
You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!
Three small ships descend, followed by a mother-ship.
Cartman
Oh, God damn it!
Mr. Garrison
[Driving by, he stops.] What the? I tell you, there's some crazy stuff going on in this town.
Mr. Hat
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
Kyle
Come down here, you stinking aliens! [Three Visitors appear.] Uh, uh...
Stan
Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
Kyle
Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing.
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
Stan
That was beautiful, dude.
Kyle
Did it work?
Stan
No, they're leaving.
Kyle
Hey, you scrawny-assed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Kyle
You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
Stan
Hey Wendy, what's a fuck? [She shrugs.]
The spaceship door opens.
Ike
Help me doy tair.
Kyle
Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
Ike
Don't hurt me.
A herd of cows runs away from the ship, but a trio of Visitors stops them in their tracks. The cows moo and quiver with fear until the middle Visitor raises its hand and addresses them.
Visitor
Moo... Moo...Moo...Moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.)
Cows
Moo?? (Really??)
Kyle
Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
Ike
Don't kick the baby.
Visitor
Moo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)
Cartman
What the hell are they talking about?
Cow
Moo moo? (Why did you turn some of us inside out?)
Visitor
Moo moo, moo. Moo. (Oh, that was Carl's fault. He's new.)
Visitor Carl
Moo...moo...moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!)
Kyle
Ike!
Visitor
Moo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.)
The cows look at each other and moo in agreement.
Kyle
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
Ike
It's my turn!
Ike dives from the ship into the snow. The satellite goes back into Cartman's butt.
Visitor
Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)
The Visitors disappear. The spaceship pulls Cartman up but the rope keeps him grounded.
Cartman
You guys, get me down from here!
He farts fire, burning the rope. The tractor beam takes him into the ship and the spaceship flies away.
Cartman
Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
Stan
Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Kyle
Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
Ike
Oh, he fly out the sky.
Chef's yard.
Chef
Wait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back!
A blonde arrives with a brunette.
Blonde
Well, Chef, where's this amazing thing you were going to show us.
Chef
Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
Forest.
Kyle
Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. [They leave.]
Stan
Thanks for your help, Wendy.
Wendy
Whatever, dude.
Stan
Hey, I didn't throw up.
Wendy
Cool!
She's happy now. They both look at each other like they're going to kiss, and that music plays again. Wendy puckers up. Stan gets queasy.
Stan
Bleech!
He barfs right on her face.
Wendy
Eww!
Stan
Sorry.
Wendy
Hey, look. A French fry.
Stan
Cool.
Wendy
And what is that?
Stan
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.
Chef's song starts up and the camera pulls away.
Wendy
Hey, what's that?
Stan
That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
Wendy
Oh hey, what about that?
Stan
I don't know what the hell that is...
Bus Stop.
Stan
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
Kyle
Yeah, we're running out of friends.
Stan
I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows.
Cows out on a pasture.
Cows
Mooo.
Officer Barbrady
Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now.
One of the cows steps on the plate on the Visitor's device. A beam from the device strikes Officer Barbrady. His glasses fly off, and cheeks become rosy.
Officer Barbrady
I love to sing-a,
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a,
I love to sing-a,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...

The cows begin hopping about gleefully.
Bus Stop. Cartman falls out of the sky, landing on his side next to Kyle and Stan.
Cartman
Puh!
Stan
Oh, hey Cartman.
Kyle
Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
Cartman
Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
Stan
Really, what about?
Cartman
Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
Stan
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
Cartman
[Sarcastically.] Oh right, [Matter of factly.] why don't I have pinkeye then?
Kyle
Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
Cartman
Ahh, son of a bitch!

	Mr. Garrison's classroom.
Kyle
Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
Stan
Yeah, it was huge.
Cartman
Ugh, I hate those things.
Kyle
Nobody hates rainbows.
Stan
Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
Cartman
Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: "EHY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!" [Silence.]
Stan
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
Cartman
I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!
Kyle
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Cartman
Ohh, rainbows. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool.
Stan
What were you talking about?
Cartman
Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it.
Kyle
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Cartman
Nothing..!
Mr. Garrison
Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month? [Silence.] One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.
Wendy
[Softly.] Wow, I knew I would win.
Mr. Hat
Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.
Mr. Garrison
That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman.
Wendy
What?
Cartman
What?
Mr. Garrison
Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.
Cartman
Kick ass!
Stan
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart.
Cartman
Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.
Mr. Garrison
Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.
Kyle
Wow, what did you write about Cartman?
Cartman
Oh, you know, this and that.
Wendy
He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
Kyle
What was your paper about Wendy?
Wendy
My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins.
Cartman
There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
Stan
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Cartman
Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?
Wendy
What?
Mr. Garrison
Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford.
Kyle
Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?
Mr. Garrison
And the presentation will be on national television.
Stan, Kyle
Television!
Mr. Garrison
[Thinking to himself.] Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.
City Hall. Mayor's Office.
Mayor McDaniels
Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
Ted
Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.
Johnson
Maybe even a State Senator.
Ted
Mayor, we should decorate the town square.
Johnson
Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town.
Mayor McDaniels
That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?
Ted
Black as the night itself Mayor.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
Ted
If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.
Johnson
Ohhh.
Ted
Ouch. [Johnson Laughs.] Thank you.
South Park Elementary Cafeteria.
Cartman
You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.
Wendy
[Passing by.] Hitler was famous too.
Chef
[Stopping by.] Hello there children.
Kyle, Stan
Hey, Chef.
Chef
How are my little crackers today?
Kyle, Stan
Good.
Chef
Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
Stan
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Cartman
Hey!
Chef
Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
Kyle
Wow, are you gonna do it?
Chef
Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
Stan
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Kenny
(How big's your penis, Chef?)
Chef
Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway.
He giggles, somewhat embarrassed.
Mr. Garrison's Classroom. Garrison is at his desk and Mr. Hat is across from him in a chair.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.
Notices Mr. Hat.
Mr. Garrison
Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
[Now on Mr. Garrison's hand.] Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?
Mr. Garrison
Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child.
Mr. Hat
We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge.
Flashback to the National Talents Show Finals.
Lil Mr. Garrison
Knock knock, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
Who's there?
Lil Mr. Garrison
Orange.
Mr. Hat
Orange who?
Lil Mr. Garrison
Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
One person claps.
Mr. Hat
Thank you.
Judges show scores of 8.9, 9, 7.8 and 9.2.
Lil Mr. Garrison
Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win.
Show Announcer
And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein.
Lil Kathie Lee
If they could see me now, that little gang of mine.
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine.
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer first-rate chums I attract
[Mexican puppet] All I can say is, "Wow-wee, look-a where I am."
[Tourist puppet] Tonight I landed, Pow!, right in a pot of jam.
What a setup! Holy Cow!
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now!

Crowd goes wild. Judges show all 10's. Little Garrison is shocked.
In the present.
Mr. Garrison
It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that?
Mr. Hat
But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.
Mr. Garrison
How?
Mr. Hat whispers to Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!
Mr. Garrison's Classroom, later in the day. The Mayor is now there.
Mayor McDaniels
Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.
Cartman
That kid is me.
Mayor McDaniels
Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.
Mr. Garrison
That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.
Mr. Garrison
[Whispers.] Mr. Hat!
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.
Wendy
Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.
Mayor McDaniels
Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!
Silence.
Mayor McDaniels
And who's our little prize winner again?
Cartman
Me! Eric Cartman!
Mayor McDaniels
How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?
Cartman
Yes ma'am. [Sings.]
I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television.

Bus Stop The kids have gotten off the bus and are going home.
Cartman
[Still singing.]
...I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television...

Stan
[Turning to face Cartman.] We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
Cartman
Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
Stan
Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
Cartman
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
Stan
Dolphins are way smarter than you!
Cartman
If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?
Stan
Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!
Cartman
Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!
Stan
Tell me what you wrote about!
Cartman
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
Stan
Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!
Cartman
Screw you, hippie!
Cartman's House. Cartman is sitting on the couch in front of the TV eating Cheesy Poofs.
TV Announcer
We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals, after this.
Beefcake
Hey!! You need to get in shape fast?! Wanna look your best?! Tired the other guys getting all the chicks?! Are you tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!
Cartman
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.
Beefcake
Then bulk up quick, with Weight Gain 4000!!
Cartman
Yes!
Beefcake
With over 4,000 grams of saturated fat per serving, its patented formula is designed to enter the mouth, and go to directly to the stomach where it is distributed to the bloodstream. Now available in stores everywhere. Get some today, and say with me: 'Beefcake!'
Cartman
Beefcake!
Beefcake
Beefcake!
Cartman
Beefcake!
Beefcake
Beefcake!
Beefcake, Cartman
[In unison] BEEFCAKE!
TV Announcer
May cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver...
Cartman
Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?
Liane
Okay Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow.
Cartman
But mom, I need it for tomorrow.
Liane
But tomorrow is grocery day Eric.
Cartman
[Shrieking.] Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!
Liane
Okay, okay, then. I guess I'll be going to the store now then.
Cartman smiles broadly.
Mr. Garrison's Bed. He hears Kathie Lee singing in his head: "If they could see me now, that little crowd of mine, and eating fancy chow..." He wakes up startled.
Mr. Garrison
No, no!
Mr. Hat
[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.
Mr. Garrison
No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it.
Mr. Hat's head starts spinning slowly, demonically, his pupils glow red.
Mr. Hat
Kill!
Mr. Garrison
That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
She'll make a fool of you again.
Mr. Garrison
Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy.
Bus Stop, next morning.
Cartman is a bit bigger and showing it off by wearing a Beefcake muscle shirt instead of layers of clothes.
Cartman
Hey dudes.
Kyle
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
Cartman
Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
Stan
What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
Cartman
I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
Kenny
(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)
Kyle
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's.
The others laugh.
Cartman
Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff.
He chugs the can of Weight Gain.
Stan
What's that stuff?
Cartman
Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.
Kyle
Bulk up to what, fat-ass?
Stan
Super fat-ass?
Cartman
Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
The bus Arrives and the others go in ahead of him.
Cartman
Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.
Town Square. A flag goes up.
Mayor McDaniels
Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!
Cows
[Out in a pasture.] Mooooo?
Outdoor stage. The class has moved there to practice a play.
Mayor McDaniels
Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?
Mr. Garrison
Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage.
Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kevin Stoley go.
Mr. Garrison
Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage.
Pip, Kenny, Red, and Token go.
Clyde Donovan
Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?
Mr. Garrison
Do you have a feather on your head?
Clyde
Yes.
Mr. Garrison
Then you're an Indian.
Clyde
Oh.
Mr. Garrison
Okay Bebe, this is your line.
Bebe Stevens
[Haltingly.] This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, don't they look adorable?
Bebe
Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers.
Pioneers come on stage and start beating the Indians and tossing them about. Screams are everywhere, and a tee-pee falls in front of Kenny.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh my God!
Mr. Garrison
They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.
Bebe
The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands.
Kevin the Indian lands by her, with blood oozing out of a gash on his head. She steps aside. Pioneer Butters punches Indian Pip repeatedly.
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.
Mr. Garrison
Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.
Stan
Take that you stupid Indian!
Stan beats Clyde the Indian with the butt of his gun.
Clyde
Dow!
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?
Mr. Garrison
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!
All stop and gasp.
Mr. Garrison
Oh my God, what have I said?
Townsman
He said, "To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"
Boos all around.
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play.
Garrison skulks away.
Mr. Garrison's House.
Mr. Hat
[In his deep voice.] It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.
Mr. Garrison
I can't kill her Mr. Hat...you're gonna have to do it.
Mr. Hat laughs.
Town Square Stage.
Kyle
Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.
Cartman is much bigger now.
Cartman
Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
Kyle
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
Cartman
I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
Kyle
Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"
Cartman
No they don't, you jealous weakling!
Townsman
God damn, that's a big fat ass!
Cartman
Hey!
Wendy
Hi guys.
Cartman
Oh look, another hippie.
Cartman gives her the peace sign.
Cartman
Peace, Wendy.
Stan
Shut up Cartman!
Cartman
Oooh,
Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...

Wendy moves by Cartman and then whispers to Stan.
Wendy
I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.
Cartman
...K I S S I N G. First comes the baby and...

Jimbo's Guns. There is a poster welcoming Kathie Lee on the left side of the store entrance.
Jimbo Kern
Can I help you?
Mr. Garrison
Yes... I need a gun.
Jimbo
Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?
Mr. Garrison
Other.
Jimbo
Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!
Hands Mr. Garrison a gun.
Jimbo
That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
Mr. Garrison
[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] I don't know, it's a little small.
Jimbo
Okay, how about this?
Mr. Garrison
[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.
Jimbo
Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.
Mr. Garrison
[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me. [To Jimbo.] I'll take it!
Mr. Garrison's Classroom, lights out. Wendy enters.
Wendy
Hello?
She sneaks over to file cabinet. Sees her paper first and is disgusted to find Cartman's question in writing: "If dolphins are so smart, why do they live in igloos?" Then she finds Cartman's paper.
Wendy
My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."
Mr. Garrison enters. Wendy hides.
Mr. Garrison
Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!
Wendy
[Hushed.] Oh my God.
Town Square. Mr. Garrison walks down the street with his rifle as if it's normal.
Townsman
Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you.
Townswoman
Nice gun Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Thanks.
He approaches Officer Barbrady.
Mr. Garrison
Hello Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
Nice Gun.
Mr. Garrison
Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee.
Officer Barbrady
Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.
They look up at it. Two vultures fly around it.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
No problem.
He turns to a fan walking by with a camera.
Officer Barbrady
Heah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee!
Mayor McDaniels
[On stage.] Where is she?
Cartman, off stage, looming over his friends now.
Cartman
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Kyle
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
Wendy
[Rushing in.] You guys, we have to stop him!
Kyle
Stop who?
Wendy
Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
Cartman
Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.
Wendy
He's got a gun!
Cartman
You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.
Wendy
It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!
Stan
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Wendy
[Sweetly.] Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?
Stan falters and looks down, unable to resist her.
Kyle
Uh oh, we're losing him.
Cartman looks down at Stan.
Mayor McDaniels
Here she comes.
The band starts playing. Kathie Lee comes in riding in bullet proof 'bubble' on the back of a truck.
Mr. Garrison, looking on from the book depository window.
Mr. Garrison
Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.
Townswoman
We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh.
Kathie Lee Gifford
I love you, too.
Mr. Garrison
Come on you little bitch. [Takes aim.] You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy.
Mayor McDaniels
[On stage.] It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
Crowd cheers.
Mayor McDaniels
...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford.
Chef
Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of uh, the humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you dowwwwn.
And lick every inch of your bodaay with my tongue.

Mayor McDaniels
What?
Chef
Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.

Mayor McDaniels
What? Oh God!
Chef
How 'bout you and meee-

Quickly taking the mic from him.
Mayor McDaniels
Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.
Chef
-get together and make... sweet...

love?
Mayor McDaniels
Thank you Chef!
She grabs the mike and drags him off.
Chef McDaniels
Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!
Wendy
[Wendy and Stan run up.] Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!
Officer Barbrady
What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. [Flashes back.]
Mr. Garrison
Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee.
Officer Barbrady
Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ...
His face gets bigger with every repetition. He snaps to.
Officer Barbrady
Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!
Stan
Wendy, look!
Points to book depository.
Back on stage.
Mayor McDaniels
And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman...
Cartman
Cartman, God damn it.
Mayor McDaniels
...is your favorite celebrity, and mine, [Crowd cheers.] Kathie Lee Gifford!
Kathie Lee is thrust up on stage in her bubble by her security force. Cartman's mom hugs her heart.
Kathie Lee
Thank you. I love you all.
Stan and Wendy reach the Book Depository.
Stan
Mr. Garrison, stop!
Mr. Garrison
Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
Wendy
I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
Mr. Garrison
You can't know.
Wendy
You should have won that talent show.
On the stage.
Kathie Lee
It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?
Cartman
Here it is, my big moment of fame.
Book Depository.
Mr. Garrison
...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
Wendy
I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.
Mr. Garrison
It is... too late for me, young Wendy.
Cartman gets on stage, with help from Kyle and Kenny. Mr. Garrison takes aim.
Wendy
You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.
Lowering his weapon.
Mr. Garrison
You... you're right.
Wendy
Gooood.
Stan
Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
Mr. Hat
[Snapping into position.] The bitch must die!
The stage. Cartman's weight breaks it.
Kathie Lee
Ooohhhh!
She flies through the air. Mr. Garrison fires at her, thinking she is still on stage. Kenny is hit.
Kenny
(Oh no!)
He flies through the air and is impaled through the head by a flag pole. He slides on down.
Kyle
Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!
Kathie Lee's bubble lands on the truck.
Agent 1
Gun!
Agent 2
Gun!
Kyle
Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play.
The entourage leaves and the crowd groans.
TV Crew Director
I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up.
Cartman
Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
TV Crew Director
Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest.
Cartman
[Whining.] But I won the environmental essay contest.
Wendy
You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.
Into mic.
Wendy
I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.
Townsman 1
Who cares?
Townsman 2
Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.
Stan
Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
Wendy
Well, not if it's Cartman.
Into mic.
Wendy
Hey, where are you all going!
Aside.
Wendy
They don't even know what Walden is.
Into mic.
Wendy
I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.
Stan
Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
Wendy
Ah, what the hell.
Kids walk out.
Mayor McDaniels
Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!
Ted
Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.
In front of flag pole.
Officer Barbrady
[Arresting Mr. Hat.] Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.
Officer Barbrady
You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt.
Apparently, he didn't see Kenny get impaled. Kenny's corpse slides down to base of flag pole.
South Park Mental Home, Mr. Garrison's Hospital Room.
Stan
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.
Mr. Hat is in a straitjacket.
Mr. Hat
We can still get her! Let mmm--
Mr. Garrison
I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
Kyle
Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
Mr. Garrison
Really, on what?
Geraldo.
Geraldo Rivera
Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat-ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house.
Cartman
When is this going to be on the air?
Geraldo
Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?
Cartman
Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Chef's Bedroom.
Chef
He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
Kathie Lee
Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?
Chef
Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?

Liane
Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.
Cartman
Okay, Mom.
Kyle
Ready to go hunting, Cartman?
Stan
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
Jimbo
That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.
Liane
Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.
Jimbo
Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.
Ned Gerblansky
Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?
Liane
Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy.
The other boys laugh.
Cartman
Dude, that's sick mom.
Liane
And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away.
They laugh some more.
Cartman
Drive, Drive!
Liane
You give your mommy a kissy.
Cartman
Drive the car damn-it, drive!
In the Humvee.
Kyle
[In a slight falsetto.] Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
Cartman
Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.
Stan
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
Kenny
(Maybe she'll suck my dick.)
Jimbo
Oh, ho, that's disgusting.
Cartman
You piece of crap, I'll kill you!
Cartman starts fighting with Kenny.
Jimbo
That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.
Cartman
Eeeeenh!
He is about to strike Kenny again.
Jimbo
Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.
Stan
Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.
Jimbo
You what?!?
Ned
mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.
Kyle
I like chocolate milk.
Jimbo
Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.
Jimbo drives the Humvee up a small mountain very close to town.
On the mountain.
Jimbo
Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.
Cartman
Hey, I didn't get a gun.
Jimbo hands him one.
Cartman
Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
Stan
You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.
Ned
Were you stationed in Da Nang?
Stan
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
Cartman
Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.
They point their guns at each other, Jimbo rushes up.
Jimbo
Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.
Stan
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
Kyle
Wow, that'd be cool.
Cartman
My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
Jimbo
Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!
Shoots it. It is hit and flips off the mound it was on.
Stan
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
Jimbo
Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.
Kyle
What do you mean?
Jimbo
You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.
Cartman
Democrats piss me off!
Jimbo
They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'
Stan
Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.
Ned
Mmm, Jimbo look, mm.
Jimbo
Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!
Jimbo pulls out a bazooka, mounts it on his shoulder, and fires a rocket. All that's left of the deer is a hind leg, which falls over.
Cartman
Kickass!!
Everyone is in creep position now, except Jimbo.
Jimbo
Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.
Ned
Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock.
A rabbit hops blissfully into view.
Jimbo
[Drops to the ground.] Let's move, moove!
He hustles off to the right. Ned follows.
Stan
Is this hunting?
Kyle
I guess so.
Cartman
Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!
On the ridge.
Jimbo
This one's yours Stan.
Stan aims at the bunny, but it just blinks at him. Jimbo coaxes.
Jimbo
[Calmly.]It's coming right for us.
Ned
It's coming right for us.
Stan focuses. The bunny blinks.
Kyle
Shoot it Stan.
Cartman
I got your back, soldier.
Stan lowers his gun.
Stan
I can't.
The bunny hops away.
Jimbo
What the? What's wrong with you?
Stan
I don't wanna shoot the bunny.
Jimbo
What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.
Stan
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
Jimbo
No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.
Cartman
Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
Stan
I can shoot you, fat ass!
Cartman
I can shoot you too!
Stan
I'll kill you!
Cartman
I'll fill you full of lead!
The mountain rumbles.
Kyle
Hey, what's that?
South Park Center for Seismic Activity, Randy is humming: another day and all is quiet. A rumble is heard in the distance, but Randy is dozing off. A stronger rumble rolls through.
Randy checks the seismograph.
Randy Marsh
What the heck is this?
He places a call.
Randy
Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check.
He looks out the window at the volcano, which shows a column of steam.
Randy
Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!
Dramatic music builds, then Randy...sips his coffee.
Night on the mountain.
Cartman
My weenies won't cook.
Ned
Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm.
Jimbo
Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.
Ned
Mmm, yepper.
Ned pours gasoline on the fire. The flames run up the stream and set Ned aflame.
Ned
Mmm, aahh, oh.
Jimbo
Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!
Ned drops and rolls. He knocks the gas can over, and the flaming gas blows up the Hummer.
Stan, Kyle
Whoa!
Jimbo
Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
Ned
Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.
Cartman is now cooking his weenies over Ned's burning body.
Cartman
Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah.
City Hall, The following morning.
Chef
But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
Mayor McDaniels
We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but...
The intercom beeps. She answers.
Johnson
Mayor, the geologist is here to see you.
Mayor McDaniels
My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
Johnson
No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth.
Mayor McDaniels
Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!
Johnson
I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker.
Long pause.
Mayor McDaniels
Just send in the geometrist.
Johnson
Geologist...
Mayor McDaniels
You are fired, buddy!
Johnson
Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you.
Randy enters.
Randy
Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
Mayor McDaniels
What does this mean to the town?
Randy
Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.
He points out relative damage levels on a chart.
Randy
Right now South Park is here.
Mayor McDaniels
My God!
Chef
Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!
Mayor McDaniels
Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? [Beeps out.]
Ted
Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted.
Mayor McDaniels
Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh. [Thump.] Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.
Back on the Mountain. Jimbo is telling stories.
Jimbo
And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.
Ned extends his prosthetic arm towards Cartman as if to show that shot-off arm is now at the campsite, climbing on Cartman.
Ned
Mmmowwwh.
Cartman flinches, and the others laugh.
Jimbo
Hah, got ya.
Cartman
Heh, tha-that's not scary.
Kyle
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!
Cartman
Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
Jimbo
Hey Ned, hand me that gin.
Ned opens up the icebox and tosses a bottle to him.
Jimbo
You boys want to tie one on?
Kyle
No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
Stan
Yeah, Cartman's pee.
Cartman
Hey, you would taste my pee!
Jimbo
What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?
Kenny reaches for the gasoline can and chugs away.
Jimbo
Christ, look at that little bastard go!
Kenny hiccups.
Jimbo
Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!
Stan
Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
Cartman
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
Kyle
Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
Softly, slowly, flashlight ready.
Cartman
Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of [He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.] Scuzzlebutt?
Stan
Whatabutt?
Cartman
Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
Stan
Why?
Cartman
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
Kyle
Deformed how?
Cartman
Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...
Stan
A hook.
Kyle
A knife.
Cartman
No! A piece of celery.
Stan
Celery?
Cartman
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy.
Kyle
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
Cartman
What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? [Silence.] So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink.
Stan
Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
Kyle
Yeah, give me that flashlight.
Kyle takes it and turns it off.
The volcano rumbles again.
Kenny
(Hey, what's that?)
Kyle
What is that?
Stan
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Cartman
Hey, it might be!
Kyle
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand.
The others laugh.
Cartman
Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
Jimbo is now playing his guitar.
Jimbo
Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.
Ned
Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
[Uncle Jimbo cries]
Mmmoh lord, Kumbayah.
Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah...

Cartman
They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!
Ned
...Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah.

Next morning. A rooster crows.
Kyle
Stan, Stan, wake up!
Stan
What, dude?
Kyle
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
Stan
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
Kyle
They're out fishing with Kenny.
Stan
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
Kyle
Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
Stan
What?
Kyle farts, and is pleased with himself. Stan does nothing.
In the fishing boat.
Jimbo
What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!
He throws grenade, killing a fish.
Ned
Mmm, got it.
Kenny throws a grenade, killing four fish.
Jimbo
Great instincts boy.
Stan runs to the side of the lake.
Stan
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!
Jimbo
Who? The fat kid?
Stan
Yeah.
Jimbo
Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!
Ned fires the load and a massive amount of fish float to the surface. The boat lands a second later
Jimbo
Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.
Ned
[Rowing to shore.] Moh man it smells like dead fish here.
Kenny
(A little like a vagina.)
Ned
Em-moh man, that is nasty.
Jimbo
Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.
Kenny
(Thanks.)
Stan's head drops.
In front of city hall. The media is now present.
Newscaster
The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony.
Crowd
Yeahhh.
They sound more excited than agonized.
Individual in crowd
Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
Newscaster
Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?
Mayor McDaniels
All we know right now is that some of our children [Sob-sob.] are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?
Newscaster
Huh?
Mayor McDaniels
Well you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1 [Melodramatically.] All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.
Chef
Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
On the mountain.
Jimbo
Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.
Ned
There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.
Jimbo
Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.
The volcano rumbles.
Jimbo
Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.
Ned
Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.
Jimbo
Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!
Fires at the ram. Kenny takes over.
Jimbo
Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.
Kyle
Look!
Cartman
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
Ned
Mmm, what is it?
Kyle
Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.
Jimbo
Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
Ned
We'll be on the cover of "Guns & Ammo".
Jimbo
This calls for some HJ-14.
Cartman
[To himself.] Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
Jimbo is now armed with twin shoulder rockets.
Jimbo
Fire in the hoooole!
Cartman
Holy crap!
Cartman jumps out of the way. The rockets hit the mound and debris goes in all directions.
Jimbo
Damn it, I think I missed.
Cartman
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Jimbo
C'mon, let's move, move!
Cartman sees them coming and backs away.
Cartman
Hey, wait, aah!
Rescue Center.
Mayor McDaniels
Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!
Randy
Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea.
Mayor McDaniels
Huh, what?
Randy
Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely.
Mayor McDaniels
And, that would be good? Right?
Randy
Uh - pretty sure.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!
On the mountain. Jimbo and the others have lost sight of Cartman.
Jimbo
These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!! [Shoots a bald eagle.] The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.
Kyle
[Sees Cartman still dressed as Scuzzlebutt] Look, up there.
Cartman
You guys, it's just me.
Jimbo
Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?
Stan
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?
Jimbo
I can't tell; let's kill it!
Cartman
Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume.
Jimbo
Kenny, you take the front.
Stan
No!
Stan takes the rifle from Kenny.
Stan
I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
Jimbo
That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!
Cartman
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
Townspeople digging trench.
Newscaster
As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary.
Rescue Center.
Officer Barbrady
Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please.
Mr. Garrison starts the film.
Host
Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a [Film skips] May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt.
Jane backs up, pulls out the blanket from under the food, and throws it over her family.
Host
That's right Jane, duck and cover.
She ducks under the blanket herself. The lava rolls over the family, causing no harm. The blanket flies off, revealing a sparkling family.
Host
So what will you [Film skips] -do when you hear a volcano erupting?
Two boys on bikes look alarmed. They leap off their bikes and hit the street, duck, and cover their heads with their arms.
Host
That's right, duck and cover.
The lava rolls over the two, causing no harm.
Host
Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.
Officer Barbrady
OK, any questions?
Chef
That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
Officer Barbrady
That's enough out of you!
On the mountain. Cartman moves further up on the slope and turns around.
Stan
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Cartman
Hey, seriously you guys!
Kyle
[Hushed.] Kill it, Stan. Kill it. [Normally.] Come on Stan, kill it.
Stan
Ah, damn it, I can't do it!
Jimbo swats Stan behind the head.
Jimbo
You pansy! give me that gun.
Cartman
Hey!
Stan
Cartman?
Cartman
Goddammit, don't shoot me!
Jimbo
What the Sam Hell?
Cartman
I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
Ned
Mmm, so much for the cover of "Guns & Ammo".
Jimbo
Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-
Boom! Lava begins to bubble out and flow.
Kyle
Whoa!
Ned
Mmm, holy crap.
Jimbo
The mountain! It's blown it's top!
A boulder of lava lands in front of Kenny.
Kyle
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kenny steps out from behind the boulder.
Kenny
(Nope, I'm okay.)
Kenny sees his arm on fire.
Kenny
(It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)
The boulder rolls onto Kenny.
Kenny
(Ugh.)
On the side of the mountain.
Townsman 1
Look, the volcano.
Townsman 2
Quick, duck and cover.
They do. The lava sweeps them down the mountainside, burning them to the bone.
At the base of the mountain, Jimbo and the others are moving quickly.
Kyle, Stan, Cartman
Aaaaah!
Jimbo
That lava's coming right for us!!
Behind them a river of lava charges down the mountain.
Looking on from the edge of town.
Chef
Oh no, look.
At the trench. Jimbo and the others have made it out of the mountain, but their way into town has been cut off.
Jimbo
What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
Newscaster
It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava.
Mayor McDaniels
God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-
Cartman
Help!
Scuzzlebutt appears and scratches his belly.
Jimbo
Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!
Cartman
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Kyle
Oh my God! Look at his leg!
Patrick Duffy
Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy.
Jimbo
Quick Ned, shoot it!
Ned aims, but no shot is heard.
Ned
Mmmoh no, out of ammo.
Scuzzlebutt
Grrrr.
Mayor McDaniels
What... is that thing?
Chef
That's Scuzzlebutt.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.
Officer Barbrady
This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
Jimbo
Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed.
Scuzzlebutt rips a tree from the ground, bites off a limb...
Kyle
Aaaaah!
...and molds the tree into a-
Stan
Whoa, he built a wicker basket.
Jimbo
Hey, he's saving us.
Scuzzlebutt puts the group in the basket and lifts them over the trench.
Scuzzlebutt
Grrr.
Liane
Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
Randy
And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
Mayor McDaniels
Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
Randy
Uhh...
Denver citizens
Aaaaah.
South Park. The ordeal is over.
Mr. Garrison
South Park is saved.
Cheers go up.
Kyle
Hey look, Kenny's okay.
Kenny appears on a mound nearby.
Kenny
(Hey guys, what's goin' down?)
Newscaster
And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.
Chef
Mmmm
Baby every time that we kiss,
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava,
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat,
Lava so warm and red and wet,
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.

Newscaster
Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?
Mayor McDaniels
Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.
Scuzzlebutt
Friend.
Scuzzlebutt presents flowers to the Mayor.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, how sweet.
Stan shoots scuzzlebutt.
Stan
I did it, I did it, I finally killed something.
He smiles, proud of himself. Unfortunately, this took place during a live report.
Newscaster
Oh my God! What has he done?
Mayor McDaniels
Turn off the cameras!
Stan
Hey, that was easy!
Patrick Duffy
Noooo! Why God? Why?!
Jimbo
Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!
Stan
What?! Why?!
Kyle
Yeah, make up your mind, dude!
Jimbo
Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?
Stan
No.
Ned
Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm.
Drops his gun, which fires one last shot as it hits the snow. Kenny is hit.
Kenny
(Oh, no!)
Rats are hot on the trail.
Stan
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
Jimbo
But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?
Kyle
Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
Stan
Yeah, [He drops his gun.] it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
Cartman
Yeah, cartoons kick ass! [All three leave.]

	Bus Stop.
Kyle
Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice.
A dog walks up to the boys.
Stan
Hiya, Sparky.
Kyle
[Looking] Who's that?
Stan
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
Kyle
Wow! Cool!
Stan
Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?
Cartman
Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
Stan
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
Cartman
No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
Sylvester
Arrrrrr.
Stan
He's not meaner than Sparky.
Cartman
Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!
Sylvester comes over.
Stan
Sparky'll kick his ass.
Cartman
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
Kyle
You're on, dude!
Sylvester starts after Sparky. Both dogs growl.
Stan
That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!
Sparky lunges after Sylvester and out of view. Aggressive panting can be heard. The boys stand there, shocked.
Cartman
Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
Stan
Sparky! Bad dog!
Kenny
(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)
Stan
What?!
Cartman
Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
Stan
What do you mean?
Cartman
That dog is a gay homosexual.
Stan looks back to study the situation, then...
Stan
He's just confused.
Kyle
I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
Kenny
(No, check his penis.)
Kyle smiles.
Stan
Sick, shut up dude!
Sparky pants happily while Sylvester slinks away.
Cartman
Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.

The bus pulls up.
Football Field, sideline before school.
Chef
Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park.
Kyle
Who's Middle Park?
Cartman
What's homecoming?
Chef
But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. [silence] Now, let's start practice.
Chef blows his whistle, and the kids hit the field.
Pip
Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?
Chef
Yes Pip, what is it?
Pip
Well, I still don't have a helmet.
Chef
I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.
Pip
Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?
Chef
Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does.
Pip
Oh.
Chef
Sorry son, now get your ass in there.
Out on the playing field.
Stan
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
Chef
[impatiently] Hike the damn ball!
Cartman hikes the ball over Stan's head. Stan chases it down. Kyle runs into Pip, opening a major gash on Pip's head.
Pip
Aaaaaaaargh!
Jimbo and Ned arrive.
Jimbo
Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef?
Chef
[distracted] Huh? Oh, fine, fine.
Jimbo
I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.
Chef
Elementary school alumni?
Jimbo
That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
Chef
I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
Jimbo
Middle Park by 70 points.
Chef
Hmmm...
They look towards the field, where Kenny tackles Cartman, causing him to drop the ball.
Chef
I don't think we have a chance.
Jimbo
Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. [yells] Right Stanley?
Stan turns to see his uncle just as Cartman hikes.
Stan
Huh?
The ball hits him on the side of the head. He picks it up and throws to Kyle.
Jimbo
Atta boy!
Chef
Great pass, Stan.
Jimbo
Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie!
On sideline after practice.
Chef
Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
Kyle
Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?
Stan
Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
Clyde
Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.
Stan
Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- [sees Sparky lunge after Rex] Sparky, get down!
Clyde
Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!
Cartman
There he goes again.
Stan
Get down, Sparky! Down!
Cartman
Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
Clyde
Make him stop!
Rex moves away with his tail between his legs.
Rex
Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!
Fosse and Bill pass by laughing.
Fosse
I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.
Bill
Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.
Fosse
Gay dog.
The bullies walk away laughing, while Sparky walks up panting.
Mr. Garrison's classroom. Start of school.
Cartman
...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-.
Cartman
Ah, dammit!
Mr. Garrison
Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next.
Stan
Um, I'm not really prepared either.
Mr. Garrison
Well, just make something up, like Eric did.
Stan
Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
Mr. Garrison
Excellent. A-.
Cartman
Eeyy!
Stan
Wow, cool!
Cartman
Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?
Mr. Garrison
Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people.
Cartman
That's not fair!
Mr. Hat
Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it.
Cartman
Stupid puppet.
Dismissal bell rings.
Mr. Garrison
Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan.
All students except Stan leave the room.
Stan
Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
Mr. Garrison
Well of course Stanley, what is it?
Stan
What's a... homosexual?
Mr. Garrison
Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.
Stan sits.
Mr. Garrison
Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?
Stan
I guess.
Mr. Garrison
Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.
Bus stop. The boys get off the bus.
Cartman
You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
Kyle
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Cartman
Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
Stan
Shut up, dude!
Sparky comes up panting with a pink scarf on.
Stan
Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
Sparky
Bark, bark.
Cartman
Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen.
Stan
He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky.
Sparky sits.
Stan
Good boy, now shake.
Sparky shakes.
Stan
Good boy. Now, don't be gay.
Stan waits for the command to sink in.
Stan
Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay.
Sparky looks at Stan with confusion and growls.
Kyle
Did it work?
Stan
I don't know.
Cartman
He still looks pretty gay to me.
Bill
Huh, huh.
Fosse
Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?
Bill
Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbara Streisand concert. [they laugh] Stupid little gay dog.
Fosse
Gay dog.
Stan
Come on you guys, I have an idea.
Sports Book, Ned and Jimbo enter. Two big-screen monitors show horse races. One of the five smaller screens above show a race as well.
Jimbo
I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
Bookie
Are you crazy?
Jimbo
No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.
Gambler 1
I want to put all my money on the Cows.
Gambler 2
Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it.
Gambler 3
Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too.
Female Gambler 1
I got 500 on the Cows.
Female Gambler 2
Well, I'll put my money on the Cows.
Jimbo
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now...
Gambler 4
You better be right about this, Jimbo.
Jimbo
Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself.
Ned
Are you sure Stan is that good?
Jimbo
Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?
Bookie
You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.
Ned
I love that song.
Jimbo
'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.
In front of Stan's house, a large crate sits next to the kids.
Stan
Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-
Stan notices a pink scarf on Sparky.
Stan
Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!
He grabs the scarf.
Stan
No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi.
The crate opens and Fifi, a French poodle, comes out.
Kyle
Ooh-la-la.
Fifi sniffs some. Sparky starts following her.
Cartman
There he goes!
Stan
Atta boy, Spark! Get her!
Sparky climbs atop Fifi.
Stan
Yes!
Sparky pulls Fifi's collar off and into the air, catching it around his neck.
Stan
Ah crap! Now what do I do?
Kyle
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
Cartman
No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France.
Kenny
(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
Stan
I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
Kyle
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
Stan
Like who?
Inside Stan's house, Jesus and Pals' title screen is on TV.
TV Announcer
And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.
Jesus Christ
Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]
Robert
Yeah, is, is this Jesus?
Jesus
Yes my son.
Robert
This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife.
Jesus
Of course Robert. How are things now?
Robert
Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins, that was really nice of you.
Jesus
Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]
Stan
Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
Jesus
My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-
The station's logo pops up.
TV Announcer
That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews.
Stan
Damn it!
Kyle
What'd he say?
Stan
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Cartman
Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
Stan
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
Kyle
Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
Stan
No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!
Outside, Sparky overhears this.
Stan
I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!
Sparky grouses, digs a hole, and makes his way out of the yard. He wanders into the mountains, looks back once more, and is gone.
On the sideline at practice.
Chef
Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover. [Music starts.] Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! [Sinks into the mood.]
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.

Kyle
Uh, Chef?
Chef
Spank it, ever so gently.

Kyle
Chef.
Chef
Spank it.

Kyle
Chef!
Chef
Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
Pip
Uh, Mr. Chef sir?
Chef
No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.
Pip
Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?
Chef
That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?
Pip
No um, I guess not.
Carl's Bombs And Explosives and Accessories.
Jimbo
What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.
Carl
What moment would that be?
Jimbo
Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.
Carl
What high F?
Jimbo
You know,
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah.

Carl
Right, right, so you want the trigger on the doo-nn-doo?
Jimbo
No, dammit! The aaaaah!
Carl
Aaaaahh?
Ned
Aaaaahh.
Jimbo
Aaaaahh!
Carl
Aaaaahh.
Jimbo
Great.
Carl
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo - Aaah.
Ned
Doo-nn-doo-doo
Jimbo
You got it.
Carl
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...
Ned
Aaa - dooo...
Jimbo
Aaaaahh!
Carl
Alright, yeah, okay...
On the sideline at practice.
Chef
What's the matter Stan, you seem down.
Stan
I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
Chef
Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.
Coming up to see what's the matter.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda.
Chef
Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
Mr. Garrison
What do you mean?
Chef
Well, you're gay aren't you?
Mr. Garrison
What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
Chef
Well, you sure do act like it.
Mr. Garrison
I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass.
Chef looks puzzled, wondering.
On the field.
Kyle runs up from behind.
Kyle
What's the matter dude?
Stan
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Cartman
Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. [Stan punches him] Ow!
Snowy mountains. Sparky is trekking through the snow, stops, and looks around. A floating castle nears him. It's Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.
Big Gay Al
Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al.
Sparky looks at him.
Big Gay Al
Have you been outcast?
Sparky pants an affirmative.
Big Gay Al
Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?
Sparky pants an affirmative.
Big Gay Al
Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here.
Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman are at the Bus Stop. Stan walks up.
Stan
Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
Kyle
Wow, it's been like two days.
Stan
I think he might've run away.
Cartman
Did you check the shopping ma- [Stan punches him] Ow!
Kyle
We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan.
Stan
I'm not playing.
Kyle
You what?!
Stan
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. [leaves]
Middle Park Elementary School.
Jimbo
[whispering] Come on Ned, and keep quiet.
Ned
[louder] Okay.
They climb over the fence and approach the Middle Park mascot, a horse.
Jimbo
Hello there, Enrique.
Ned
What are we doing here?
Jimbo
Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead.
Jimbo puts the bomb on Enrique's back.
Jimbo
And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in "Loving You", Boom!
Enrique gets wide-eyed.
Jimbo
No more Middle Park players.
Jimbo and Ned laugh, and Enrique starts to tremble.
Jimbo
God damn, I love football!
Stan is in the stormy mountains.
Stan
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
South Park Elementary.
The Middle Park Cowboys exit the bus.
Cowboys
Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!
South Park Football Field. The bleachers are filled with fans decked out in COWS! gear. Even Ike is wearing a GO COWS shirt and bouncing about.
Frank Hammond
Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows.
Pounds the table, and Phil's mike falls over. He scans the sidelines.
Frank
Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up.
Chef
[between his teeth] Oohh, come on, Stan...
Pip
Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?
Chef
No Pip, I'm sorry!
Stormy mountains.
Stan
Sparky! Sparky!
South Park Football Field, first quarter. The game is about to begin.
Referee
Play ball.
Chef
You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.
Kyle
But I never practiced quarterback.
Chef
Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now.
Frank
Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski.
Mr. Garrison
Hey hey, where is little Stanley?
Mr. Hat
Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?
Jimbo
Ned, look!
Middle Park's mascot, Enrique, is shown.
Jimbo
They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.
Ned
Yay.
Stan follows his dog's footprints and finds himself facing Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.
Big Gay Al
Hi little fella, how are you doing today?
Stan
Fine, how are you?
Big Gay Al
I'm super, thanks for asking.
Stan
My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
Big Gay Al
Well, let's see. Come on in. [they enter]
Stan
Do you have lots of gay dogs here?
Big Gay Al
We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.
Gay Lion
Rooaar.
Big Gay Al
And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!
Stan
Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
Big Gay Al
Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance?
They enter the techno-dance floor as disco music plays. Animals pour in to dance, even a dolphin on its tail.
Vocalist
Oww, we can both be gay!

In the huddle. The Cows win the coin toss.
Kyle
Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?!
Huddle
Break!
At the line of scrimmage.
Cowboy 1
You guys are toast.
Cowboy 2
Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in.
Cartman
We'll just see about that.
Kyle
Set, set.
Cartman farts long and nasty right into Kyle's face. Kyle quickly retreats.
Kyle
Damn it Cartman!
Chef
What's the matter?
Kyle
Cartman farted!
Cartman
No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
Chef
Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
Kyle
No way dude!
Chef
Hike! The! Ball!
Kyle is back in position, with his shirt covering his nose.
Kyle
Ah, dude, weak.
Cartman
That's right, you get back there.
Kyle
Hike!
Frank
Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes!
Screaming as Kyle is tackled.
Frank
Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter.
Jimbo
Hell's bells.
Frank
Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King.
Phil quickly covers the mic.
Phil
Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again.
Frank
Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that.
Townsman 1
We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo.
Jimbo
Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh.
Big Gay Al's Big Gay Dance Floor.
Vocalist
...both be gay.

Stan is dancing with a monkey, then sees Sparky.
Stan
Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?
Sparky
Ruff.
Stan
I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
Sparky
Barr.
Stan
Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.
Sparky follows Stan.
Stan
We can work on making you not gay together.
Sparky stops and sits.
Stan
Sparky?
Big Gay Al
Young man, it appears you still don't understand.
Stan
What don't I understand?
Big Gay Al
Come this way, I have to show you something.
South Park Football Field, second quarter.
Frank
With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0.
Kyle
Hut, hut.
Cartman snaps the ball to Kyle. The Cowboys blitz. Kyle flips the ball back to Pip, who is still without a helmet. The Cowboys players descend on him as soon as he catches the ball.
Frank
Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant.
Phil muffles Frank.
Phil
Dude! Now that is not cool.
Frank
Sorry, sorry.
Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride.
Big Gay Al
Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride.
Stan looks at the boat.
Big Gay Al
Step aboard, Stanley.
He and Sparky step aboard the boat.
Big Gay Al
Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time.
South Park Football Field. South Park's final drive before the halftime show.
Frank
And the South Park Cows are set to receive...
The Cowboys kick off.
Frank
There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick.
Kenny weaves through the special teams.
Frank
He's at the 50, the 40, the 30.
Cowboys
Hold him, hold him!
Two of them take hold of Kenny's arms.
Cowboys
Hold him, hold him!
Cowboy
Yaaah!
A Third Cowboy dives in, taking Kenny's head off, as the other two sever Kenny's arms.
Frank
The little running back is down. I think he's...
Rats come in to devour Kenny's corpse.
Frank
Yes, he's been decapitated.
Kyle
[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Phil
Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank.
Frank
Ouch-a-roo!
Chef
Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field!
Frank
Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot.
Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride.
The boat-ride begins the passage through several animatronic scenes.
Big Gay Al
You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan.
The tips of the Japanese soldiers' swords touch.
Big Gay Al
Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!
Big Gay Al fires off a shot with his pistol.
Big Gay Al
Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely.
Doors open to reveal a scene reminiscent of 'It's a Small World'.
Boat Ride Singers
We're all gay, and it's okay,
'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.
We're not sad anymore, cause we're out the closet door.
It's okay, hey, to be gay!

Big Gay Al
Sooo, what do you think, Stan?
Still singing.
...It's okay to be gay...

Stan
This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand.
Still singing.
It's okay to be gay. Shalala waylaylay shalala waylaylay. It's okay to be gay.

Big Gay Al
[to himself] Isn't this precious?
South Park Football Field. Halftime.
Frank
And now, here to sing the touching song Loving You, is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother...
Audience Member
Alright Richard!
Music starts up.
Richard Stamos
Loving you,
is easy cause you're beautiful,
-doo-n-doo-doo-doooo-
Aaaaah!

His voice cracks and the music stops.
Richard
Aaaaah!

Jimbo
What the hell?!
Richard
Aaaaah!

His voice wavers.
Jimbo
He didn't sing the high F!
Mr. Garrison
Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.
Jimbo
Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked.
Richard
Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala la la lala...

Mr. Garrison
[heckling] It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
Outside of Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.
Stan
Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!
Sparky
Ruff!
Big Gay Al
No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?
Stan
No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!
They start to walk off.
Big Gay Al
Oh Stan?
They stop.
Big Gay Al
When you get back to town, [earnest music plays] tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately.
Stan
I will Big Gay Al, I will.
They depart.
Bell dings.
Big Gay Al
Ooh, my carrot cake! [rushes inside]
South Park Football Field, fourth quarter.
Kyle
Hike!
Frank
And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since...
Mr. Garrison
I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo.
Mr. Hat
Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game.
Townsman
You're a dead man, Jimbo!
A hail of food products is thrown at Jimbo.
Frank
Well, this should just about wrap it up for-
Stan and Sparky come onto the field.
Frank
Wait a minute, what's this?
Jimbo
Yeah! Yohooooh!
Frank
It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback!
Chef
Where the hell have you been Stan?!
Stan
I've been getting my best friend back.
Chef
Just get in there boy!
Jimbo
Give 'em hell, Stanley!
Stan takes his place on the field as Jimbo looks to the heavens, and prays aloud to himself.
Jimbo
Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?
In the first row of the stands.
Jesus
Leave me alone.
Stan
Hike!
Frank
Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.
Kyle
Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think!
Stan
Mph!
Stan throws the ball.
Frank
And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid!
Kyle
Oof.
Kyle runs towards the end zone, panting, Cowboys hot on his trail.
Frank
Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!
Frank recoils.
Phil
Dude!
The crowd cheers as Kyle scores.
Frank
Touchdown!
Jimbo
Yeah! Wooo!
Frank
The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread!
Frank swats his mic away.
Jimbo
Yeah! Woohoo!
Postgame press conference. Stan gets on stage by scoreboard.
Townsman
Speech!
Frank
Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?
Stan
Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
Crowd
Yeah, alright!
Stan
And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!
Crowd
Wooooh!
Stan
And it's okay to be gay!
The crowd falls silent.
Jimbo
What?!
Stan
Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
Mr. Garrison
What the hell is he talking about?
Frank
Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?
Stan
I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.
The crowd looks at Stan in disbelief.
Stan
It's true, I'll show you.
At the site of Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. There is nothing to be seen.
Stan
But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...
Cartman
Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man.
The missing animals suddenly appear.
Townswoman
Oliver! I thought you ran away all those months ago!
Townsperson 1
Sidney!
Townsperson 2
Willy!
Townsperson 3
Carlos!
Big Gay Al is suddenly at Stan's side.
Big Gay Al
I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.
Stan
Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
Big Gay Al
I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done.
He pops his suitcase open and climbs into it.
Big Gay Al
Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you.
He presses a button, and the suitcase closes.
Stan
Wow!
The suitcase flies off.
Richard
You guys, you guys! I can do it.
Mr. Garrison
Do what?
Richard
Loving you,
Is easy cause you're beautiful,
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo

Jimbo
No!
Richard
Aaah!

Enrique
Mroo-
BOOM!

Cartman
Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
Stan
Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.
Cartman
Your sister beat you up again, huh?
Stan
No!
Cartman
Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
Stan
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.
Kyle
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
Cartman
I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"
Stan
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
Cartman
Be a man Stan. Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."
Stan
Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
The camera pulls back to get the elephant in the picture.
Kyle
You mean this one?
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
He's my new pet elephant.
Stan
Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?
Kyle
I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
Stan
Wow, that's cool!
Kyle
No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
Cartman
That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.
Kenny
(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)
Stan
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
Ms. Crabtree's bus arrives.
Ms. Crabtree
Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing?
Kyle
Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
Ms. Crabtree
Oh—I'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus.
Shot of retarded kid bus. Retarded noises of protest are heard.
Kyle
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya.
He enters the bus with Stan and Kenny.
Cartman
[Entering.] If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"
Ms. Crabtree
SIT DOWN KID!!!
Cartman
[Stung.] Yes ma'am.
Mr. Garrison's Classroom.
Mr. Garrison
And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.
Mr. Hat
That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.
Kyle
Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
Yes Kyle.
Kyle
With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
Mr. Garrison
Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.
Kyle
That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants.
The class gasps.
Kyle
They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
Stan
That'd be cool!
Bebe
I want a pot-bellied elephant.
Pip
Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.
Terrance Mephesto
That's stupid.
Kyle
Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
Terrance
Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.
Kyle
I'll bet you can't.
Terrance
Watch me plebeian.
Mr. Garrison
Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.
Mr. Hat
Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.
Mr. Garrison
You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month.
The bell rings. Most of the class leaves, but the boys stay behind.
Kyle
Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet!
Stan
Wait, wait. We still need a pig.
Kyle
We can use Cartman's pig.
Cartman
Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
Kyle
We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
Cartman
You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!
The boys leave.
Mr. Garrison steps forward to stop Stan.
Mr. Garrison
Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?
Stan
Okay.
Mr. Garrison
I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?
Stan
[Despondantly.] Yes...
Mr. Garrison
Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it.
Stan sits down.
Mr. Hat
I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?
Stan
Oh, neither. It's my sister.
Mr. Garrison
[Indignantly.] Your sister?! Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!
Stan's house. A TV is heard.
Jesus
Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions...
Shelly turns to see Stan coming out of the sofa's shadow.
Shelly Marsh
Hey!
Robert
Yeah, is this Jesus?
Jesus
Yes, my son.
Stan
Hi Shelly.
Shelly
Are you looking at my headgear?
Stan
Headgear? What headgear?
Shelly
Are you looking at my headgear?
Stan
Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
Shelly gets up and glowers at him.
Shelly
You little liar.
She starts advancing, and Stan starts retreating.
Stan
No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH!
Stan turns to run, but she has his arm, she proceeds to beat the living hell out of him. She tosses him down the stairs into the basement, then approaches the doorway. He climbs out, but she flips him back towards the living room, then goes for the TV and drops it on his head. After the TV shorts out, he removes it, but she throws him like a basketball out the window, where his friends are waiting.
Kyle
Ready to go Stan?
Stan
Go where?
Kyle
To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
Kyle
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
Cartman
Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
From the broken window.
Shelly
I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!
Kyle
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
Cartman
Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"
She appears at the broken window.
Shelly
Who said that?
All stay quiet. Cartman points to Kenny.
South Park Engineering Ranch, night. The boys approach the entrance.
Kyle
This must be it.
Lightning strikes the ranch.
Cartman
[A bit wary.] Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time.
Kyle
No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
Cartman
It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
Kyle
It's just a stupid pig.
Stan
Yeah, quit being such a baby.
Cartman
Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
Stan
At least I'm not a little pig-fucker!
Cartman
Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.
Kyle
What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
Cartman
Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
Kyle
There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
Cartman
I'll kick you in the nuts!
Dr. Alphonse Mephesto
Can I help you?
The boys all gasp, and Kenny pulls his hood closed.
Kenny
Mmmmmm!
Kyle
Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
Mephesto
Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs.
Kyle
No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
Mephesto
Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in.
Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch.
Mephesto
I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
Cartman
Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
Mephesto
It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.
Monkey
Mhhh.
Kyle
How does that make the world better?
Mephesto
And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose.
Stan
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
Mephesto
Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.
Cartman
Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
Mephesto
And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.
Kyle
Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?
Mephesto
Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
Kyle
Which song is that?
Mephesto
Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!

Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.

Cartman
You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
Mephesto
You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days.
Mephesto pricks Stan with the syringe.
Stan
Ow!
Mephesto
Hmm? What? Oh, excuse me.
Kyle
Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
Mephesto
Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I have some hair please?
Kyle
Watch out Stan! Genetic engineers are crazy.
The boys quickly move away.
Cartman
Come on Fluffy!
Fluffy Squeals.
Inside the Cafeteria.
Kid 1
This fish is just hurting my anus.
Kid 2
Naw, it's pretty fresh.
Cartman
UUuuhh. I sure am hungry.
Pip
'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?
Silence. The boys stare back.
Pip
Lunchy munchies, hmmm?
Cartman
Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!
Kyle
Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!
Pip
Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue...
Cartman
God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass.
Stan
Yeah! Go away, Pip!
Pip
Righto.
Pip walks off.
Cartman
Gah, French people piss me off.
Terrance, Bill, & Fosse Approach.
Terrance
Hey dumb-asses. You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?
Kyle
No! We're already halfway done.
Terrance
Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.
Bill
Yeah, it's probably a gay pig too.
Fosse
Stupid gay pig.
Kyle
It's more than you've got!
Terrance
Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way.
One of the bullies opens a bag and drops it. A foot pops out.
Kyle
Oh my God! They cloned a foot.
The foot kicks Cartman in the face.
Cartman
Ugh!... Hey! I'll kick your ass!
Cartman kicks it away, and it lands in Pip's lunch tray and bounces away.
Pip
Eho!
Terrance
By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being. Good luck with your stupid little pig.
In the kitchen
Chef
Hello there children.
Kyle
Hey Chef.
Chef
How you doin'?
Boys
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Kyle
We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
Chef
Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
Chef
Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't...

A pig-elephant. Say, now that's not a bad idea.

Kyle
I told you guys.
Chef
Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house. Children, we could make a fortune with this.
Kyle
You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!
Chef
Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.
Cartman
Whaaat?!
Stan
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
Cartman
I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
Chef
Sure they would. But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.
Stan
So how do we do that?
Chef
Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.
Boys get off the bus later that day.
Stan
Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
Kyle
We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.
Stan
Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
Cartman
Why? Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
Stan
Shut up Cartman!
Kenny
(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
Kyle
Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.
Cartman
Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"
Astonished looks from the other guys.
Stan
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
Cartman
I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.
Kyle
Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly. The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."
Kenny
("And I want to see you handling your breasts.")
Stan
Sick dude, she's my sister.
Kyle
Try it. We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
Cartman
No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig! You leave Fluffy out of this!
Kyle
Come on Kenny.
Cartman
Kyle no, seriously. No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I... Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.
Stan
Crap.
Stan's house. Stan sneaks through the front door.
TV Voice
And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park Public Access...
Shelly
Are you staring at my neck-brace?
Stan
No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neck-brace?
She jumps off the sofa and grabs him by the throat.
Stan
Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that... that you're my sister, and I love you.
Shelly smiles, Stan smiles, it looks like she's gonna let him go... yeah, right! She throws him off to a clear space on the floor, where he lies defeated.
Stan
No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
Shelly
You'll never be bigger than me Stan. Never!
Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch.
Mephesto is marveling at his creation.
Mephesto
Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful. My son, I think we've finally done it.
A fetal version of Stan is seen in the incubator.
Terrance
Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.
Bill
Hopefully not a gay clone.
Fosse
Yeah, that was stupid.
Bill
Stupid.
Fosse
That was stupid.
Out in the hills somewhere, Kyle is pumping a keg that the elephant is drinking from.
Kyle
Come on elephant, keep drinking.
Stan
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig.
Fluffy is drinking from a trough labeled "Beer".
Kyle
Dammit! This is never gonna work.
Chef comes into view.
Chef
Hello children. I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
Kyle
Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
Chef
Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood.
He moves over to a boombox with a mic attached.
Chef
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.

The elephant and pig approach each other. Fluffy smiles at the elephant, then turns around in order to receive him.
Chef
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!
Enter Elton John. Intermingled shots of Fluffy and elephant getting interested.
Elton John
Oooo tonight
Oooo it's all right
Oooo tonight is right for love, love gravy.

The boys applaud
Chef
Thank you Elton.
slowing the tempo. Houses all over the hill show couples embracing.
Chef
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.

Elephant is about to mount Fluffy.
Kyle
Hey look! It's working.
Chef
Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life. The beauty of Mother Nature.
Squish. Squeals follow.
Kyle
Aah!
Stan
Sick!
Cartman
Fluffy!
Chef
Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt.
Squealing continues.
Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. A big mutant version of Stan is in the incubator, with a very long left arm.
Mephesto
How luscious. Our creature has come to fruition, boys.
Terrance
Dad, you're the best.
Mephesto
Oh my God! He only has one ass. He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room.
Big Stan breaks out of the incubator.
Mephesto
Oh no, this entire experiment is turning out very bad.
Big Stan
Me bad??
Big Stan throws four-assed frog against wall, killing it.
Mephesto
Eeegads, he's out of control. We'll have to destroy him.
Terrance
But he's our science fair project!
Big Stan
Uhhh, me baad, aba-ba-chewy-chomp.
Mephesto
He's too dangerous son.
Terrance
But dad! I want a human clone.
Mephesto
Son, no.
Big Stan jumps through window, then tears down the ranch gate entrance.
Mephesto
Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake. You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy.
Terrance
They're all stupid anyway. Come on guys, let's go.
Bill
Yeahh, they're all gay.
Back on the Hill. Shot of Fluffy and elephant sleeping together.
Kyle
Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
Chef
Oh, they will. It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.
Kyle
I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
Stan
Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
Chef
Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.
The elephant begins to wake up.
Chef
Uh oh, here we go.
Elephant looks down at Fluffy with surprise and bellows.
Chef
Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.
Fluffy looks up at elephant, begins crying.
Chef
Or a big fat elephant.
Kyle
Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
Chef
Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.
Kyle
Couple of days? But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
Cartman
Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?
Kyle punches Cartman.
Cartman
Hey!
Mephesto approaches.
Mephesto
Oh thank Buddha I found you boys. You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately?
Stan
Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
Mephesto
No, no, I said odd.
Chef
Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.
Mephesto
Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy... then... uhhhhh... hmmm... oh, nevermind. I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch. You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free.
Kenny
(A big mutant Stan?!)
Stan
A big mutant version of me?
Kyle
Is he bigger than a regular clone?
Mephesto
He's terribly dangerous. His brain is identical to yours. I need you to help me find him.
Downtown South Park. Big Stan is wreaking havoc on the town. People are running in fear. Big Stan has a car in one hand, he's destroying it. A woman screams. Big Stan tosses car aside effortlessly.
Big Stan
Ah chewy-chewy-chomp.
Woman
Oh my Gooodd!
Mr. Garrison
Stan, are you wearing a different hat?
Big Stan
Uhhhyahhuhhh.
picks up Mr. Garrison and begins beating him against the ground
Mr. Garrison
Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention.
Big Stan throws Mr. Garrison aside.
Mr. Garrison
Aaaaaah!
Mr. Garrison flies through Jimbo's Guns window.
Mr. Garrison
Ooooh.
Boys in Downtown South Park.
Kyle
How big do you think he is?
Stan
I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
Kyle
Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
Kenny
(Look at that! What's he doin'?)
Stan
Oh my God!
Townsman
Aaaah!
Big Stan is running by with two people in his arms.
Newscaster on TV.
Tom
It appears that the horrible, destructive creature is actually eight-year old Stan Marsh of South Park. When asked why he was wreaking so much havoc on his home town, the little boy replies simply, "Me Stan, ba-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp. Back to you in the studio.
TV Newscaster
Thanks Tom, police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year old boy you immediately kill him and burn his body. That's all for now.

On the streets of South Park. Officer Barbrady is directing traffic.
Stan
Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town. We have to find him.
Officer Barbrady
You boys have been watching the "X-Files" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -
Big Stan
Ahhhh.
Big Stan grabs Officer Barbrady and throws him into nearby pond.
Officer Barbrady
Whoa! [From under the surface.] Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.
Kyle
Come on, let's go!
Stan's Uncle Jimbo approaches.
Jimbo
There you are! Stanley, you tore up my entire gun shop, you better have a good explanation for this mister!
Stan
It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
Mr. Garrison walks up looking like hell.
Mr. Garrison
Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?! You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!
Jimbo
I'm gonna go have a word with your father Stanley.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.
Kyle
Wait, Stan, there he goes.
Stan
Stop!
Big Stan
Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp?
Kyle
He recognizes you dude.
Stan
That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down.
Big Stan is now seated in the road.
Big Stan
Ba-chomp, eh mee ahh jaran.
Kyle
What should we do with him?
Stan looks at Big Stan, then smiles mischievously.
Stan
Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
Big Stan
Ahhhh, yeahhh.
Outside Stan's house. The boys and Big Stan approach the front door. Sparky can be seen off to the side.
Stan
...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelly, kick her ass. Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
Big Stan
Me bad??
Stan
No! Shelly bad, you good.
Big Stan proceeds to destroy the house.
Stan
He's tearing up the house, stop him!
Big Stan is hitting a chair against the ground. Kenny runs towards Big Stan, who uses the chair to chuck him into the microwave in the kitchen. The microwave starts up, cooking Kenny.
Stan
Come on Kyle, Cartman.
The boys run at Big Stan, and he knocks each one aside.
Big Stan
Ah.
Shelly
What the hell do you want?
Big Stan
Chewy-chewy-chomp.
Shelly head butts him onto the ground.
Big Stan
Ahhh. Uhhh.
Mephesto rushes in followed shortly by Terrance with Bill & Fosse.
Mephesto
Boys! Boys, I'm lusciously sorry for everything.
Terrance
Hey, they've got our clone. He belongs to us.
Mephesto
No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere. Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such - inconvenience. I tried to play God, and I failed.
Mephesto shoots Big Stan through the head.
Terrance
Daddy! Nooooo!
Mephesto
All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed. Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations. Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics.
Terrance
You cheating bastards. This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.
Kyle just now noticed something.
Kyle
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Stan sees his parents drive up.
Stan
Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
Cartman
I ain't helpin' crap! I want to eat some paeh.
Stan
You can't just leave me here alone.
Cartman
Oh yeah, watch me. [Zips away.]
Kyle
Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not. See ya. [Leaves.]
Stan
Thanks a lot.
Shelly
Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now.
Jimbo and Mr. Garrison are shown outside, talking to Stan's parents.
Stan
It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! Mom and dad are gonna send me away! I don't want to be sent away! I want to stay here! Eehhhehehe!
Randy and Sharon enter.
Randy
Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?
Sharon Marsh
Everybody in town is upset with you young man. What's going on? Are you on drugs?
Shelly
It's not Stan's fault.
Randy
Huh?
Shelly
It wasn't Stan, he was... it was with me the whole time.
Randy
Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.
Sharon
Oh honey, please forgive us son.
Stan
Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.
Shelly begins beating the crap out of Stan.
Stan
Uh, ahh, oooh.
rats drag away Kenny's charred corpse as Shelly takes a lawnmower to Stan's face.
Mr. Garrison's Class. The science projects are due.
Mr. Garrison
Everyone, let's give K. C. and his weed a big hand.
Only Clyde claps.
Mr. Garrison
Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.
Kyle
Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'. Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project.
Terrance
Thank you Mr. Garrison. Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man. I present to you, the five-assed monkey.
Shot of Monkey with five asses.
Monkey
Ahhheh.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful.
More students clap.
Stan
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth. It, it had a baby!
Kid 1
It had a baby?
Kid 2
Oh wow!
Clyde
What's it look like?
Kyle
Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
Cartman
Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence? Hmm, what are the odds of that?
Hat
Hmmm. You boys get first prize.
Cartman
That'll do pig.

	Stan's House.
Marsh Family
Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear grandpa...

Marvin "Grandpa" Marsh
Uhhhhh.
Marsh Family
...Happy birthday to you.

Sharon
Now blow out the candles grandpa.
Grandpa blows, but nothing comes out but a low moan.
Sharon
Hurray!!!
Randy
How's it feel to be 102, paps?
Grandpa
Shoot me.
Sharon
Make a wish grandpa.
Grandpa
I wish I were dead
Randy
Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa.
Grandpa
I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old.
Sharon
Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?
Shelly
I will.
Randy
Me.
Stan
It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
Shelly
That showsh for babiesh, it'sh show shtupid.
Stan
Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
Sharon
Oh, alright, but take your grandpa with you.
Stan
Aw, dammit!
Sharon
Language.
In front of the TV. Stan has his slice of cake with him.
TV Announcer
And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
Phillip
Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.
Terrance
Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.
Phillip pulls, and Terrance lets loose with a juicy fart. They both laugh.
Stan
Heheheh hehehe...
Grandpa
Uhhhhh
Grandpa lines a shotgun up to his face, but it leaves a big hole in the picture behind him when he shoots.
Grandpa
Ah, dammit!
Stan looks at him.
Granpa
How would you like to make a dollar Billy?
Stan
My name's not Billy grandpa, it's Stan.
Grandpa
Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?
Stan
Sure.
Grandpa
Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
Stan
I'm not gonna kill you grandpa.
Grandpa
Why not?
Stan
'Cause, I'll get in trouble.
Grandpa
I killed my grandpa when I was your age.
Stan
Leave me alone grandpa.
On the TV there's a fart, and more laughter.
Grandpa
What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents.
Kyle's House. Ike and Kyle are watching 'Terrance & Phillip'
Phillip
Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too.
Phillip farts, and they laugh.
Terrance
Ohhh, you farted.
Kyle is laughing pretty hard.
Sheila Broflovski
Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?
Terrance
Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?
Phillip
I sure would Terrance.
Terrance
Alrighty then, here's a two-lip.
Terrance farts, and they laugh.
Sheila
What is this?
Kyle falls off the armchair laughing.
Sheila
It's horrible!
Kyle gets up off the floor.
Kyle
Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.
Phillip knocks Terrance's head to one side.
Phillip
Take that you stupid dick.
Sheila
What did he say?
Terrance
You're an asshole Phillip.
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?
Laughter. She turns the set off.
Shiela
Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!
Kyle
But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
Sheila with her arms akimbo.
Sheila
Oh really? Is that so?
Cartman's House.
Terrance
Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.
Phillip
You're exactly right Terrance. Oh.
Fart. Laughter.
Terrance
Oh no.
Laughter.
Cartman
Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!
Liane
Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.
Cartman
That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
Liane
Ohhh, okay hon.
Stan's House. Stan is going to bed, but before entering he reviews his chores for the morrow. Grandpa has added one more...
Stan
I'm not going to kill you grandpa!
Grandpa
Ingrate!
Stan
Good night grandpa.
Grandpa
You pompous son of a whore!
Mr. Garrison's Class.
Student
Huh huh, I had another ...
Cartman punches Kyle on the shoulder.
Kyle
Ow! What the hell was that for?!
Cartman
That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
Clyde
Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?
Kyle
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
Cartman
Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
Mr. Garrison
Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
Cartman
[Tauntingly.] Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?
Mr. Garrison
She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.
Class
Yeahh, woohoo!
Mr. Hat
Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds.
Silence.
Mr. Garrison
You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.
Kenny walks in.
Mr. Garrison
Kenny, why are you late to class?
Kenny hands Mr. Garrison a note. The note reads 'Please excuse me from being late, I have a case of explosive Diarrhea, signed -K'
Mr. Garrison
Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.
Addressing the class.
Mr. Garrison
Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...
Kenny is waving his hand frantically.
Mr. Garrison
Yes Kenny, what is it?
Kenny
(I have to go pee.)
Mr. Garrison
I thought you just came from the bathroom.
Kenny
(I did, I gotta go again...)
Mr. Garrison
Okay okay, go ahead.
Kenny goes in the restroom.
Mr. Garrison
As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment.
Throughout the lecture, sounds of some serious diarrhea come from the bathroom. The sounds get progressively worse as Kenny moans loudly. Kenny reenters the classroom at the end of the lecture.
Stan
Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
Mr. Garrison
Pay attention children!
Pounds on the lectern.
Mr. Garrison
I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever.
Cartman
What?
Clyde
Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?
Kyle's face drops.
Mr. Garrison
That's right children. Are there any questions?
Stan raises his hand.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, Stanley?
Stan
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
After a moment of reflection.
Mr. Garrison
What, what do you mean?
Stan
My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
Kyle
Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
Stan
Really??
Kyle
Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
Stan
Wow!
Cartman
Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
Stan
So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.
Kenny
(Oh my God!)
Kenny runs into the bathroom and releases a large splatter of diarrhea.
Kenny
(Owww!) [Splatterrrrr!]
School Cafeteria.
Cartman
Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.
He starts convulsing and making seizure related sounds.
Stan
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
Kyle
But won't your grandpa be there?
Stan
Yeah...
Cartman
Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
Chef
Hello there children.
Stan
Hey Chef.
Chef
How's it goin'?
Stan
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Stan
Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?
Chef
You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on.
Stan
No, I mean, kill my grandpa.
Chef
No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.
Stan
See, I told you dude.
Kyle
Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
Cartman
Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
Stops himself twice before responding
Chef
I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
Stan
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
South Park PTA Meeting.
Sheila
And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean.
She puts the tape in and starts the VCR.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, guess what?
Phillip
What?
Rips a fart.
Terrance
Fart.
Sheila
Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny.
Randy
Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh.
Other PTA members stare at Randy in shock. He looks around chagrined.
Sheila
Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
Loud, juicy fart comes from the little boys room. Mr. Garrison exits.
Mr. Garrison
Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters.
Amid peals of laughter.
Townsman
Ha ha, green apple splatters.
Stan's House.
Grandpa
Uhhhh.
Stan
Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
Grandpa
Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet.
Stan
No grandpa, I'll get in trouble.
Grandpa
Kill me, God dammit!
Stan
No, I can't even kill a deer.
Grandpa
Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?
Cartman
I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
Seizing the opportunity.
Grandpa
Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.
Cartman
What!
Grandpa
That's right.
Stan
Grandpa!
Grandpa
And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.
Cartman
Hey!
Grandpa
Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma.
Cartman
You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
Grandpa
That's the spirit Tubby.
Restraining Cartman.
Stan
Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
Cartman
Don't talk about my mom like that!
Dragging Cartman away.
Stan
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
Grandpa
I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?
Cartman
Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!
Stan
Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.
Cartman
Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.
Stan
I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die.
Kyle
I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
Stan
Hey, yeah!
Stan's House, kitchen.
TV Announcer
And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access.
Jesus
Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.
Jesus presses a button on the phone.
Jesus
First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'.
There's an echo.
Caller
Yeah, is this Jesus?
Jesus
Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback.
Caller
Oh, sorry.
Caller fixes the echo.
Caller
Uh, this is Martin...
Jesus
Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know.
Martin
How the hell'd you know that?
Jesus
Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?
Martin
Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-
Jesus
Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance.
Martin
Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus.
Jesus presses a button on the phone.
Jesus
Next caller, you're on the air.
Stan
Jesus?
Jesus
Yes my son?
Stan
Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
Jesus
My son...
Stan
Yes?
Jesus
I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.
He presses a button on the phone.
Jesus
Next caller.
Stan
Goddammit!
Jesus
I heard that.
Stan
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Cartman
Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
Kyle
Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
Stan
Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole!
Cartman
Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.
Kyle
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Cartman
Oh, biiitch.
Turns around and hoists his ass up to simulate a woman with a big ass.
Cartman
Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.
TV Announcer
And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.
Phillip
Oho yeah, I love beans.
Cartman
Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.
Grandpa
Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa please?
Stan
Okay grandpa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.
Phillip
Well, don't fart on me Terrance.
Cartman
Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.
Kenny
(Oh my God!)
Kenny runs to the bathroom.
Cartman
Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.
After receiving the dreaded fart.
Phillip
You're such an asshole, Terrance.
Terrance
Haha, that I am!
Laughter.
Disgusting diarrhea sounds.
Kenny
(Ow!)
Cartman
Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.
Shelly
Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
Stan
We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
Shelly
No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?!
Stan traces the rope and realizes that Grandpa has hung himself, but hasn't died.
Grandpa
Tug - a - little harder, Billy.
Stan
Aaah!!
Releases the rope. Grandpa falls to the ground, landing on his side.
Grandpa
Uh, ow.
Shelly
You little jerk!
Slugs Stan in the face
Shelly
You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom!
Grandpa
Dammit! I was so close.
Some time later the kids are the ones on television.
TV Announcer
Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather.
Talk Show Host
Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?
Stan
We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
Talk Show Host
Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame.
In front of Tom's Rhinoplasty.
Sheila
These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!
Crowd
Woooo!
Townsman
Huh? Oh god! Oh god!
Runs into a Port-a-Potty for some quick relief.
Sheila
We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!
Sound of a deep, wet, sonorous fart.
In front of Cartoon Central.
Cartoon faces of Tragedy and Comedy adorn the signs.
Sheila
We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!
Loud cheering from the crowd.
Sheila
We want more quality television, like Full House.
More cheering.
In line to use the Port-a-Potty.
Randy
Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me.
The Mayor exits the Port-a-Potty.
Randy
Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Mayor McDaniels
I just had a brown baby boy.
Laughter.
Stan's House, in disarray. Kyle is jumping on the sofa, Stan and Cartman are tossing the football, and Kenny is flying a kite.
Stan
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.
The others scramble to the sofa and start jumping.
Kyle
Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
All
Whoopeee!
Grandpa
Come here Billy, I want to show you something.
Stan
Aww, do I have to?
Grandpa
Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me...
Stan jumps off and follows Grandpa towards his room.
Grandpa
...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa.
They both enter, Grandpa shuts the door.
Stan
Hey, what are you doing?!
Grandpa loads a cassette into a tape player.
Outside the room with Kenny and Cartman
Kyle
What are they doing in there?
Cartman
I don't know.
Grandpa
Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy?
Stan
Uh, I guess.
Grandpa starts the tape, which plays a bit of Muzak that evokes Enya's 'Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)'
Stan
Okay, you, you can let me out now.
Grandpa
Not just yet.
He turns up the volume.
Stan
Let me out grandpa!
Stan tries to open the door.
Stan
I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time.
Singer
Grandpa
That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa.
Stan falls out of the room, looking very haggard.
Singer
'Gonna fly, gonna fly, gonna fly'

Grandpa turns off the radio and follows.
Stan
Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
Grandpa
So now will you kill me Billy?
Stan
Sure I will grandpa, I will.
In front of Cartoon Central, New York.
Liane
Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.
Sheila
It'll work, it has to.
Townsman
Look! It's the president of the network.
John Warzog
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warzog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network.
He clears his throat a couple of times.
John Warzog
Fuck you.
A slight pause.
John Warzog
Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there.
He turns back towards the building.
Sheila
Hey, you will not get away with this!
He moons the crowd. They gasp in shock. He goes inside and shuts the door.
Sheila
That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.
Liane
Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?
Sheila
Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?
Liane
[Lustily.] Ohhh, yes, indeedy.
They laugh.
Outside of Stan's house.
Stan
Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. [To Kyle.] You got the cow all tied up?
Kyle
Yep, all done.
Stan
'Kay, come on guys.
The boys struggle to lift the cow over grandpa's head.
Cartman
Why don't we just shoot him?
Stan
You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Kyle
Yeah, stupid!
Grandpa
That's good Billy, a little higher now.
Cow
Moooo!
In front of Cartoon Central.
Sheila
The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?
Mr. McCormick positions himself in front of a large sling shot.
Sheila
Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!
Mr. McCormick is flung into the front of the Cartoon Central building, splattering into bloody death. The crowd gasps.
Sheila
We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes.
Sounds of abdominal pain as people line up to the Porto-potties.
Outside of Stan's house somewhere.
Stan
Are you ready grandpa?
Grandpa
Does the pope crap in the woods?
Officer Barbrady drives up. He is staring at the scene of a cow dangling above Grandpa by a rope. Stan stands off to the side, knife in hand, ready to cut the rope.
Police Radio
7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52.
Cow
Mooo!
Officer Barbrady
Carry on.
He starts the car back up and drives away.
Stan
Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you.
Grandpa
Uhh, cut the damn rope already!
Sounds of thunder. Lightning flashes. Death appears and disappears.
Stan
What is that?!
Kyle
Well, it, it looks like...
All
Death!
Death
Mrrrrr!
He points at them.
Grandpa
It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.
Death approaches grandpa.
Grandpa
Come on, let's go.
Death continues past grandpa, towards the kids.
Grandpa
What the...?
Stan
Hey, he's coming towards us.
Kyle
Why is Death coming after us?
Death
Mrrr.
Kids
Ahhh!
The kids run into Stan's house and towards his room, Death in hot pursuit. Stan struggles to open the door.
Cartman
Aaaah, runrunruuun!
They enter the room. Stan bars the door with his body.
Death
Mrrr.
Death bangs on the door.
Kyle
What are we gonna do?
Death
Mooorrrr!
In front of Cartoon Central.
Newscaster
As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors.
Sheila
Here Carol, I think it's your boy.
Sharon
Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?
Stan
Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
Sharon
Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there.
Stan
Yeah, but, mom!
Sharon
Here honey, talk to your father.
Randy
Did you turn the heat down?
Stan
Dad, Death is coming!
Randy
Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather.
He hangs up.
Stan's room. Death is trying to enter.
Death
Mrrrr!
Stan
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
Kyle
Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
Kenny
(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)
Kyle
Totally dude.
Stan
Good point man.
Death
Mrrrr!
Death cuts through the door with his scythe.
Stan
Ahhhh!
Kyle
Quick, jump through the window.
Cartman
Ehh, eh, ehhhh!
Kenny pushes Cartman out the window and follows.
Death
Mrrrr!
South Park Main Street.
Kids
Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
Death is following the kids on a tricycle. Grandpa tries to keep up on his electric wheelchair.
Grandpa
Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
Kids
Aaaah!
Kyle sees Death close to Kenny.
Kyle
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Grandpa
Come over here you son of a whore!
Death ignores him, but something in T.V. World makes Death take a second look. Terrance and Phillip are on TV floating in spacesuits. There are seven screens - a giant central one flanked by three smaller ones on each side.
Phillip
Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?
Terrance
Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?
Farts. Canned laughter.
Phillip
Oh, you farted.
Death laughs.
Terrance
Ohho God.
Death is laughing uncontrollably.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?
Phillip
No Terrance, why don't you tell me?
Terrance
Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!
Laughter. Death laughs.
Stan
[Noticing.] Hey look!
After Terrance farts.
Phillip
Oh, there's one.
The kids go back to watch the show with Death. They are all laughing.
In front of Cartoon Central.
Newscaster
Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is...
He puts his hand to his earphone.
Newscaster
Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!
The door to Cartoon Central opens. The president emerges wearing a gas-mask.
Townsman
Wait, wait.
John Warzog
Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked.
Shot of a large pile of crap lying in front of the two Porto-potties.
John Warzog
Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Sommers.
The crowd cheers.
John Warzog
Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!
The crowd continues to cheer.
Townsman
Huh, oh no!
He is launched, and he leaves a bloody mess on the sign.
Sheila
At last, now we can return to normality.
Television store in downtown South Park.
Terrance
Hey Phillip.
Phillip
Yes Terrance?
Terrance
Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
Phillip
Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.
Cartman
Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on.
Static appears on the TV, and then a new screen comes up.
TV Announcer
We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.
Loud Static. Death is upset and resumes his mission.
Death
Mrrrrr!
Kids
Ahhh!
South Park Main Street. Death turns and touches Kenny, and Kenny falls over, dead.
Kyle
Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
Stan
Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
Grandpa
Hey, you were supposed to kill me!
Death
Mrrr.
Grandpa
That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it.
Death points a cold finger up the street. From a misty haze emerges an incredibly haggard looking ghost of a man.
Stan
Whoa!
Great-Great-Grandpa
Billllyyyy...
Grandpa
Grandpa?
Great-Great-Grandpa
That's right, Billy.
Grandpa
My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?
Great-Great-Grandpa
I asked you to kill me Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo.
Grandpa
Limbo?
Great-Great-Grandpa
I was wrong to put you in that position Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes.
Grandpa
But I've been waiting for 25 years.
Great-Great-Grandpa
Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes...
Death, Great-great-grandpa and Kenny's ghost fade away into the mist.
Stan
Come on you guys, let's go home.
A rat comes up and takes Kenny's corpse away.
Stan's House.
Sheila
Here they are!
Randy
Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.
Stan
What do you mean?
Sharon
We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air.
Cartman
You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!
Sheila
But look what they put on.
Turns on the TV.
TV Announcer
And now back to She's the Sheriff.
Cartman
Ohhh, God, No!
Suzanne Somers
You are the one behind all these shenanigans.
Dude
Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it.
Sheila
What did he say?
Suzanne
Up yours, butt-munch.
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat!!!
She turns on her heel and takes up her sign.
Sheila
Come on everybody, back to New York!
The Marshes follow her out the door.
Kyle
Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
Stan
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
Cartman
My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
Kyle
Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
Stan
Cool!
Cartman
Yeah!
Grandpa wheels up wearing a touristy shirt, carrying an Africa brochure.
Stan
What are you doing grandpa?
Grandpa
I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?
Stan
That's my silly grandpa.
All laugh. Kyle farts.

Bus Stop. The boys await the bus. Mir crashes. One end of it falls on top of Kenny, narrowly missing the other boys.
Stan
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Cartman
What the hell is that thing?
Kyle
It looks like a UFO.
Cartman
There's no such thing as UFOs.
Sirens wail as ambulance pulls up. Two paramedics go over to Kenny's corpse.
Paramedic
Let's get 'im to the morgue.
They put his corpse in a body bag, then toss the bag into the ambulence and drive off.
Cartman
Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.
Kyle
Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.
Stan
Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready.
They walk off.
South Park Morgue. Outside, an owl hoots, then a crow reaches the morgue's sign and shits on it. Inside the morgue a mortician places a hose into Kenny, blood starts flowing out.
Mortician
You know, I think death is least funny when it happens to a child.
Marty places a hose into Kenny, green embalming fluid flows in.
Marty
Oh, yes, I know what you mean.
Marty pulls out a hot dog, pours Worcestershire sauce on it, and takes a bite.
Mortician
Marty, do you have to put that stuff on everything?
Marty
I don't know, it ju- it just makes everything taste so...English.
Mortician
Well, let's let him drain.
They walk away. Worcestershire sauce falls over and pours into embalming fluid. Kenny's eyes open, and he gets up.
Mortician
...So then the necrophiliac says, "If this ain't a cadaver then I-"
Kenny busts through a door and takes a bite out of the mortician's head.
Mortician
Hey!
Kenny bites Marty's shoulder.
Marty
Aaah!
Kenny walks away.
Marty
God damn! That little turd bit me!
Mortician
Me too!
Kenny leaves the morgue and an owl hoots.
Bus Stop. Kyle is standing there with a Chewbacca mask on. Stan walks up; his costume consists of red yarn hair and big rosy cheeks.
Kyle
Ha ha, you look like a pansy.
Stan
Shut up Kyle!
Kyle
What uh, what are you supposed to be?
Stan
I'm Raggedy Andy.
Kyle
Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
Stan
Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
Kyle
No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
Stan
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Kyle
Wow! Cool!
Cartman walks up.
Cartman
Hey, dudes.
Kyle
Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
Cartman
It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.
Stan
Where'd you get that?
Cartman
My mom made it, isn't it cool?
Kyle
No it's not cool!
Cartman
What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?
Stan
No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass!
Cartman
Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool.
He and Kyle laugh.
Kyle
Hehe. Sissy.
Stan
I'll kick your ass, Kyle!
Cartman
Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!
Kenny's corpse approaches.
Stan
Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
Kyle
You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.
Stan
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
Kyle
Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?
Cartman
Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.
Stan laughs. Kenny does nothing while birds chirp.
Cartman
I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!
Silence.
Cartman
I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!
Silence.
Cartman
Poor piece of crap.
Ms. Crabtree's bus pulls up.
Ms. Crabtree
COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING LATE!
Stan
Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
Ms. Crabtree
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
Stan
I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."
Ms. Crabtree
Oh, neither can I.}
South Park Clinic. Marty and the mortician are being treated.
Doctor
[á la James Stewart] Very interesting.
Mortician
What, what is it doc?
Doctor
Well, your- your temperature is only 55 degrees, you have no pulse, no heartbeat, and your, your eyes are all puffy and sticky.
Mortician
Oh no, you mean...
Doctor
Yeah, I'm afraid the two of you have - Pink Eye.
Marty and the mortician gasp.
Doctor
I'd give you topical medicine, but I don't wanna touch ya.
Marty
Oh I'm so hungry, and all I can think about eating is, eh, brains!
Doctor
Yeah, well for God sake don't touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some antibiotics.
South Park Elementary. The boys are walking into class.
Kyle
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous...
The entire class has a Chewbacca mask on.
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Kyle
Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
Mr. Garrison is in drag, Mr. Hat has a Chewbacca mask on.
Mr. Garrison
It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.
Mr. Hat
Roar.
Kyle throws off his mask.
Kyle
Dammit!
Stan
Wendy?
Wendy
Hi, Stan.
Stan
You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
Wendy
Yeahhh?
Stan
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
Wendy
I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.
Stan
You what?!
Wendy
I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca.
Stan bangs his head against a desk.
Bill
Heheh. Heheh.
Fosse
Hey Stan, you look almost pretty enough to kiss.
Bill
Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh.
Stan bangs his head again.
Fosse
Yehaha.
Bill
Huhuh.
Cartman
There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
Kyle
Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
Cartman
You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
Kyle
Wookies don't live on Endor!
Cartman
[In a mocking voice.] Wookies don't live on Endor.
Kyle
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Cartman
What?! What did you say?
Mr. Garrison
Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel-
Kenny's arm falls off and Mr. Garrison stops.
Wendy looks down at it.
Wendy
Eww.
Mr. Garrison
Is there a problem Kenny?
Silence.
Mr. Garrison
Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?
Kyle
I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
In front of Cartman's House. Liane is decorating the house and yard, and she sings...
Liane
Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...

She places a poster of Richard Nixon (aka Tricky Dick) on the door. Two zombies, formerly the mortician and Marty, pass by.
Liane
Hello there!
Zombie
Uuuhh.
Liane
Happy Halloween!
Zombie Mortician
Must eat brains.
They attack a passer by, eating his brains and tearing his arms off.
Liane
It's the most wonderful time of the year,
do do do do do do do do-

Passer-by
Aaargh!!! Oh my God!!!
The zombies finish him off.
School Cafeteria.
Kyle
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
Cartman
Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding? [As Kenny.] No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like. [As himself.] Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
Kyle
Aren't you hungry Kenny?
Kenny just sits there.
Stan
He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
Chef
Hello children.
Kyle, Stan
Hey Chef.
Chef notices Cartman's Hitler costume.
Chef
What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
Cartman
Eating Kenny's pudding.
Principal Victoria walks up.
Principal Victoria
Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef.
Chef
Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
Principal Victoria
Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?
She turns to the boys.
Principal Victoria
Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!
Noticing Cartman's costume.
Principal Victoria
Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!
Cartman
Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.
As Kenny, poking the side of Kenny's head with a fork for effect.
Cartman
That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.
Principal Victoria
Where did you get that costume, young man?!
Cartman
My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
Principal Victoria
Sshh! Oh, God bless America.
She grabs Cartman's shoulder; he starts screaming.
Principal Victoria
You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
Cartman
Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o.
Principal Victoria drags him from the table. Clyde enters the cafeteria with his lunch, and Kenny...
Clyde
Owww, you bit my arm!
Clyde's arm begins to throb and glow.
Kyle
[Pleased.] Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.
Principal Victoria's office.
Principal Victoria
Watch the video Eric.
She starts up the VCR.
Narrator
Adolph Hitler was a very, very naughty man.
Adolf Hitler
Schnell ach. Lovental bros lieben. Alle Menschen werden Brüder. Doktor Stalin? Alarm! Menchoss? Zellan vei zamboa-
Cartman begins daydreaming of himself as Hitler.
Cartman
Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!
Puffy the Bear
So remember kids, dressing like Hitler in school isn't cool!
Principal Victoria
Now, do you have any questions?
Cartman
[Gleefully.] Could I see that again? That was cool.
Principal Victoria
You must remove that costume, immediately!
Cartman
I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
Principal Victoria
Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.
She spies a white sheet behind Cartman.
Principal Victoria
Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?
Cartman
[Whining.] I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
Principal Victoria
Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man.
Cartman looks suspiciously like a Ku Klux Klan member.
South Park Street. Pack of zombies walks down the street. A pair of joggers are jogging.
Jogger
Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around.
The zombies attack the joggers, who scream for their lives.
School gym, the costume contest is about to start.
Cartman
Boo! I'm a ghost.
Stan
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
Cartman
Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
Chef
Hello, children.
Cartman
Hey Chef.
Chef
Aaaaah!
Chef runs away
Cartman
Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?
Stan
Hey, where's Kyle?
Kyle bursts in through the doors.
Kyle
Check this out!
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Cartman
What is that?
Kyle
I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
Mr. Garrison blows a whistle.
Mr. Garrison
Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes.
They line up on the stage.
Mr. Garrison
Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers.
Some scattered applause.
Cartman
Who?
Kyle
Dude, I thought she was dead.
Stan
Yeah, me too.
Tina hands Mr. Garrison the results.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you Miss Yothers. Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume.
Tina places a second place ribbon on Kenny.
Mr. Garrison
...And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume!
Tina places a first place ribbon on Wendy.
Kyle
What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!
Tina looks on shocked.
Mr. Garrison
And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children. [Everyone laughs.] Yeah.
Stan
Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
Wendy
Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
Stan
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe.
Bebe begins bobbing for apples.
Mr. Garrison
That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing.
Clyde
Brainnns. Ahh.
Clyde attacks Bebe, attempting to eat her brains.
Mr. Garrison
Wait your turn Clyde.
Outside Chef's House. Somebody jumps out from behind a bush.
Johnson
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuhh!
Chef
Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?
Johnson
Piiink eyyye.
Chef
Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye!
Chef closes the door and sits down to watch TV.
News 4 Special Report, referring to Mir's crash landing.
Tom
...And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, "Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussy space station."
The backdrop shifts to a pair of pink eyes.
Tom
In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini.
Cut to Midget, behind which zombies are shown ransacking the town.
Midget
Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus.
Zombies are shown attacking another townsperson, and generally ransacking South Park.
Midget
Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes.
Chef
Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
At the bus stop, nighttime.
Cartman
Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.
Stan
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
Cartman
Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
Stan
No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
Cartman
Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.
Stan
Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Cartman
God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
Kyle arrives dressed as a vampire.
Kyle
Hey dudes.
Stan
Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
Cartman
Check.
Stan
Plastic pumpkin pails...
Kyle
Check.
Stan
Taser...
Stan lights it up.
Kyle
What's that?
Stan
For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
Cartman
Yeah, granola pisses me off.
Kenny arrives.
Kyle, Stan
Hey Kenny.
Cartman
Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
Kyle
You still didn't get a costume Kenny?
Silence.
Cartman
Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.
Silence.
Cartman
I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!
Silence.
Cartman
I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.
Wendy
Hi guys.
Cartman
Hi Wendy.
Stan
[Pointedly.] How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?!
Wendy
Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.
Cartman
You what?! Are you insane?!
Wendy
Let's go trick-or-treats.
Stan
I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
Wendy
Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.
Cartman
How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
Stan
Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!
Wendy
But Stan!
Stan
No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!
The boys walk away. Wendy looks dejected. A low moan is heard and a shadow overcomes her.
Wendy
AAAAAAAAAAAH!
South Park Clinic. A patient turns to the side and coughs.
Chef
Doctor!
Doctor
Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?
Chef
No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.
Doctor
What the hell are you talking about?
Chef
Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!
Doctor
Chef, Ah- I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Le- let me give you some, some topical cream.
Chef
Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!
Chef tears off Mr. Torres' arm. Mr. Torres is gushing blood.
Mr. Torres
Aaah!
Doctor
Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef.
Chef
Oh, sorry.
Chef tries to replace Mr. Torres' arm.
Chef
But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here.
Mr. Torres falls over, in shock from blood loss.
Doctor
Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years.
Chef
Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?
Doctor
Well, uh, i- it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeah.
Zombies burst through the doctor's door.
Chef
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Chef leaps out the doctor's window as zombies close in on the doctor.
Doctor
Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody.
They attack.
Doctor
Ahh!
In front of a House. The kids ring the doorbell.
The Boys
Trick-or-treat!
Kenny's other arm falls off.
Elderly Woman
Ohh, how cute.
Reaches to place candy in Cartman's pail. Kenny attacks her arm with a vengeance.
Elderly Woman
Aaah!
Stan
Dude, Kenny!
Elderly Woman
Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911!
She retreats and shuts the door.
Cartman
Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.
From inside her home.
Elderly Woman
Call 911!
Stan
Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.
Cartman
You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!
City Hall. Chef bursts into the Mayor's office.
Chef
Mayor, we've got a big problem.
There is a pile of money on the Mayor's desk. Barbrady is presently wearing a garter and fishnet stockings. The Mayor stands up, her blouse in disarray.
Mayor McDaniels
Ugh!
Gets up from under her desk.
Mayor McDaniels
Why, why Chef. What a surprise!
Chef lets out a sigh of exasperation.
Officer Barbrady
You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
Chef
Actually, uh-
Mayor
Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.
Officer Barbrady
[Wagging his finger.] Not a thingy-dingy.
Chef
I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
Mayor McDaniels
You mean, Tina Yothers?
Barbrady and McDaniels chortle.
Chef
No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!
Officer Barbrady
Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?
Barbrady and McDaniels laugh.
Chef
[Pissed.] Aw, the hell with you both!
leaves the office.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, let's get back to it.
Officer Barbrady
Righty-o.
The Mayor lies down behind the desk.
Another House, another doorbell. A large individual opens the door.
The Boys
Trick-or-treat.
Dude
Hope you kids like chocolate-peanut butter-cream puffies.
Kenny attacks his shoulder.
Dude
Aaah!
Kenny is literally feasting on this guy. The guy twirls around as he says.
Dude
Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah!
He falls down, Kenny takes chunks out of his skull and eats them.
Cartman
Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
Stan
Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
The boys pass by a house being overrun by zombies.
Somebody
Oh, God!
Yet another house, yet another bell. Three KKK guys open the door.
The Boys
Trick-or-treat.
the Klansmen stare back.
Cartman
Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.
One of the guys places a single candy in Cartman's pail.
Cartman
One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
Cartman, Kyle, and Stan walk through downtown South Park. Zombies are tearing up the town. Ned and Jimbo can be seen on a rooftop firing at the zombies. Two zombies are playing hot potato with a head.
Female
Oh my God!
A person off to the left is decapitated.
Female
Oh my God!
A zombie picks up a car and drops it on a child.
Female
Nooo!
Chef's House, and the boys ring his bell.
The Boys
Trick-or-t-Aaah!
Chef appears with two chainsaws in hand.
Chef
Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
The Boys
Hey, Chef, trick-
Stan, Kyle

Chef
[Suddenly calm.] Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.
Cartman

Chef
Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
Cartman
I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
Chef
Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha!
The kids enter and sit on his sofa.
Stan
What are you talking about Chef?
Chef
Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
Kyle
Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
Chef
Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.
Stan
Oh my God, that means...
Kyle
If everyone is turned into zombies...
Cartman
Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!
Stan and Kyle gasp.
Cartman
Aaah!
Kyle
Chef, you've gotta help us!
Chef
I'm working on it children.
Packs the chainsaw.
Stan
Wait, where are we going?
Chef
The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue.
Kyle farts. Stan and Cartman laugh.
Cartman
It was Kyle.
South Park Morgue.
Stan
I don't know about this Chef.
Kyle
Yeah, I'm scared.
Cartman
Remember candy, focus on the candy.
Inside the Morgue.
Stan
What are we doing here Chef?
Chef

Kyle looks around the desk.
Kyle
I found it! I found it!
Stan

Stan
We told you dude.
Cartman
You guys, shit...
Chef
You better let me take that Kyle.
Chef takes the magazine.
Stan
Hey Chef. Look
Stan and Chef see the embalming fluid, and the knocked over Worcestershire sauce bottle. Chef retrieves the bottle and reads the label, which says:
WARNING!

Emergency Hotline

Chef

Pip bursts through a window.
Pip
Piiink eye!
Cartman
It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
Pip
Aaah!
More zombies are bursting into the Morgue.
Chef
Look out children!
Four zombies break through a wall. One comes out from a file cabinet. One stands in front of the boys and threatens them. Four more come through the wall next to the window, followed by Kenny. Stan pummels the threatening zombie with a baseball bat and takes him out.
Zombie
Ow, ooh, ow, gowuh-
Stan
Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?
He looks to his right and sees that Chef is now a zombie, dressed like Michael Jackson in the "Thriller" video.
Kyle
Chef!!!
He begins to dance, and the zombies join him. During the song, the zombies are dancing, as though elaborately choreographed.
Chef
I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.

Wolf howl, then Chef lets loose a howl.
Stan
Let's get out of here!
The boys leave.
Chef opens his jacket.
Chef
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
In the cemetery by the morgue.
Stan
We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
Cartman

Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!
He removes the head and arm from one zombie.
Cartman
Aaah, kew!

Stan and Cartman are laying into zombies, heads are flying everywhere. Cartman takes one zombie in the groin while Stan is shown removing the head from another. Wendy approaches, Stan turns to see who's next.
Stan

Wendy
Aaahahah!
Cartman
Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!
Stan
I know, but uh-... but...
Cartman
Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
Stan
Hey, yeah!
Stan starts revving the chainsaw.
Hotline Voice
For regular sauce, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you do not just go out and start decapitating zombies left and right. Do you understand? Do not start decapitating zombies left and right!
Kyle
Uh, okay. Then what?
Wendy
Aaahh.
Stan
[Apologetically.] Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
Cartman
Kill her Stan!
Hotline Voice
All you have to do is kill the original zombie. The one that started the whole mess. Once you kill the original zombie, all the others zombies will turn back to normal.
Kyle
Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
Hotline Voice
We realize you have a choice in worcestershire sauces, we are delighted that...
Kyle hangs up and stops.
Kyle
Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
Wendy
Aaah!
Stan
I, I can't.
Wendy
Aaah!
Kyle runs in with a third chain saw and cuts Kenny in half.
Kyle
Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
Wendy's zombie look fades.
Wendy
Oh, what happened? Stan?
Stan
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
Kyle
It's working! They're turning back to normal.
Chef
You did it children!
Cartman
Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!
Wendy
I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
Stan
That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
Wendy
Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.
puckers up. Stan freezes up and looks ill, then pukes on Wendy.
Wendy
Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!
She walks away. Stan just looks on.
Cemetery. The boys are at Kenny's grave. Somber music is playing.
Stan
Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
Kyle
Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
Stan
Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
Cartman
Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way.
Cartman begins to sob uncontrollably. Kyle tries to console him, but refrains.
Stan
You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
Kyle
...No, dude, that's Christmas.
Stan
Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
Kyle
Costumes and candy.
Stan
Oh.
Cartman still wailing, then abruptly snaps out of it.
Cartman
Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
Kyle
We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
Stan
Yeah.
Cartman
Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
Stan
Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
Cartman
Lehh, eh, screw you guys!
Somber music plays again. Zoom in on Kenny's grave. Weird music plays as Kenny, newly sewn together, bursts from the grave.
Kenny
(Heeeeyyyy, kick ass.)
A statue of an angel falls on Kenny.
Kenny
(Ow!)
A moment later an airplane crashes into Kenny and the statue.

Stan
That was awesome!
Kyle
Yeah!
Liane
Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?
Cartman
Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
Liane
Sure hon.
Cartman
And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!
Terrance and Phillip have just landed.
Phillip
Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
Terrance
It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here.
Farts.
Phillip
AAAAAH!
Laughter. The boys are now enjoying their Cheesy Poofs.
Phillip
Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
Cartman
Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
TV Announcer
Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs.
Kyle
Oh, cool.
TV Announcer
And now a word from our sponsor.
Sally Struthers
Here in the heart of Africa children are dying. Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I'm Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help.
Stan
Hey, who's that fat chick?
Kyle
Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
Stan
Oh.
Sally Struthers
You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce.
Stan
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
Kyle
Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.
Cartman
Yeah, HEY!
Sally Struthers
For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.
Cartman
That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?
Sally Struthers
Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.
Cartman
KICK ASS!!
Stan
SWEET!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Stan
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
Stan dials up the number.
Kyle
Did they say if it's waterproof?
Stan
Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?
Listens for the answer.
Stan
Oh.
Kyle
What did she say?
Stan
Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.
Kyle
Ass-rammer.
Stan
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Cartman
When do we get the sports watch?
Stan
Just a second fat-ass!
Cartman
You vas-deferens!
Stan
Hello? No, no, it's a ma- [To his friends, confused.] Vas-deferens?
Kenny
(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)
Stan
Oh.
Kyle
Ask her if we get the watch right away.
Stan
Do we get the sports watch right away?
Pause.
Stan
She says we do.
All
Cool.
Cartman
I get to wear it first, you guys.
Mr. Garrison's Classroom.
Kyle
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Cartman
Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
Mr. Garrison
Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?
Cartman raises his hand.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, Eric?
Cartman
When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
Mr. Garrison
Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Eric listens.
Mr. Garrison
A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
Stan
You mean, like Kenny?
Mr. Garrison
Exactly.
Cartman
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
Mr. Garrison
[Impatiently.] I don't know Eric, they just do.
Kyle sniffs at Kenny. Kenny withdraws.
Mr. Garrison
Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.
Cartman
I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!
Wendy
Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
Cartman
Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!
Wendy
This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
Cartman
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!
Wendy
Many would rather die than go to those places!
Cartman
Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!
Mr. Garrison
Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?
A pack of wild turkeys burst into the classroom.
Clyde
Aaaah!
Mr. Garrison climbs atop his desk.
Mr. Garrison
What the hell is going on?!
The turkeys are tearing up the classroom. One of them rips up a Thanksgiving poster and takes it with him.
Clyde
Aaaah!
A turkey overturns Clyde's desk, dumping Clyde on the ground. Some others vandalize the blackboard. Just as suddenly as they entered, the turkeys exit, closing the door behind them. Silence ensues.
Mr. Garrison
Well, you don't see that everyday.
City Hall.
Mayor McDaniels
Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor.
Aide 2
It should be something festive.
Mephesto and Kevin burst into the office.
Mephesto
Mayor, we've got a very big problem.
Mayor McDaniels
Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?
Mephesto
Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving.
Mayor McDaniels
[Warily.] Uh huh.
Mephesto
You know, to provide food for the needy.
Mayor McDaniels
[Sarcastically.] Of course.
Aide 1 glances at her.
Mephesto
Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off.
Mayor McDaniels twirls her chair around and twirls her finger 'round her ear.
Mayor McDaniels
Naturally.
Her aides snicker, then she turns again.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, do go on.
Mephesto
We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short.
Mayor McDaniels turns around and pulls out a cuckoo clock, which chimes a couple of times. Her aides snicker. Aide 2 has his ears wiggling. She puts the clock away and the aide stops his ears.
Mayor McDaniels faces Mephesto again.
Mayor McDaniels
You were saying?
Mephesto
They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil.
Mayor McDaniels
[With feigned shock.] Oh, my!
Turns around and pulls out a donkey, which heehaws a couple of times. Her aides chuckle.
Mephesto having observed how the Mayor was reacting to him.
Mephesto
Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.
Mayor McDaniels
Uh now why would you say that?
Cartman's house. The kids burst through the front door.
Everybody
Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?
Cartman
I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?
Liane
[Peeks.] Not yet hon.
Stan
Damn.
Kyle
Hey, look you guys.
TV Announcer
And now, back to Part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special.
They are in a snowed-in town.
Terrance
I sure am cold, Phillip.
Phillip
Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.
Terrance
Gosh, I hope we don't starve.
Phillip farts a high one and Terrance laughs.
Phillip
Ah, a squeaker!
The boys laugh and then the doorbell rings, and a couple of knocks follow. The boys stand stiff not knowing what to do until...
Kyle bolts to the door.
Kyle
The digital sports watch is here.
The kids open the door smiling in anticipation. An emaciated Ethiopian kid stands looking back at them, with baggage in hand. Their smiles turn into surprises. The postal truck takes off.
Cartman
What the hell?
Stan
Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.
Kyle
Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
Stan
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
Kyle
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.
The Ethiopian 'speaks' and clicks something.
Kyle
Whoa! That was cool.
Stan
Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
Kyle
What's your name dude?
The Ethiopian Kid clicks something ending with,
Kid
Mabin.
Stan
I think he said his name is Marvin.
Cartman
Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.
Kyle steps out with Stan and shakes Marvin's hand.
Kyle
Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
Cartman
Hey mooom?
Liane
Yes hon?
Cartman
We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?
Liane
Sure, hon.
Cartman
Sweet.
Cartman steps outside with Kenny.
Stan
Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.
Kyle
Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
Cartman
No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
Stan
It was my mom's credit card.
Kyle
Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
Cartman
Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
Kyle
Totally.
Kenny slugs Cartman.
Cartman
Ahh!
Stark's Pond. A couple is walking near the pond. Romantic music is playing.
Woman
Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
Man
Not as beautiful as you.
Woman
[Swooning.] Ooooh.
The couple embraces and kisses as a horde of turkeys storm the pond. The guy hears them and looks over her shoulder.
Man
Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys.
Woman
Oohh, they're so beautiful.
Man
Not as beautiful as you.
Woman
Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.
Man
Not as beautiful as-
The turkeys attack the couple, stripping their clothes off. Screams are heard as the turkeys overwhelm the couple.
King Jimmy's All You Can Eat Buffet. The price is right. The boys and their families are there with Marvin.
Stan
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Cartman
Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.
The crowd laughs.
Cartman
Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?
A waiter places a plate of shrimp in front of Cartman.
Cartman
You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
Marvin
Ap-ee-tizer.
Cartman
This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.
A waiter approaches with plates of ham, turkey, and drumsticks.
Cartman
Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers.
He tosses the plate of shrimp into a trash can. The shrimp don't make it in. He, Liane, and Stan work on the drumsticks, Randy slices into the turkey, and Kyle is slicing some ham for himself (!). Marvin reaches for a pot-pie on Cartman's plate.
Cartman
No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.
Stan
Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
Cartman
Oh yeah, you're right.
eyes a slice of pie sitting before Marvin.
Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man? [Heading to a whisper.] Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...
Mr. Garrison's Classroom.
Mr. Garrison
Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.
He reaches into the box of canned goods.
Mr. Garrison
And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?
The class stares back blankly.
Mr. Garrison
Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.
Silence. Mr. Garrison begins laughing.
Mr. Garrison
Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.
Stan
Yeah, yeah, we do!
Cartman
Yeah, that's right.
Kyle
We do!
Mr. Garrison
All right boys, show us what you've brought.
The boys walk to the front of the class with Marvin.
Kyle
This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin.
Marvin looks inside the food box.
Stan
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.
Marvin pulls out a can of food.
Cartman takes it away and puts it back.
Cartman
No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.
Marvin takes it back out.
Cartman
No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
Mr. Garrison
Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?
Stan
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
Mr. Garrison
The sports watch from the commercial?
Kyle
Yeah, that one.
Bebe
I want a Starvin' Marvin.
Clyde
Me too.
Pip
Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.
Class
Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me.
Mr. Garrison
Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.
Kyle
Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
Principal Victoria's Office.
Principal Victoria
Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.
She hangs up the phone and addresses the boys.
Principal Victoria
Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Stan
No.
Principal Victoria
You can't care for this child!
Kyle
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
Principal Victoria
Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.
Stan
So why can't he live here now?
Principal Victoria
Because he can't!
Kyle
Because why?
Principal Victoria
Because eight-year olds can't be parents!
Kyle
Then you take care of him.
Principal Victoria
[on the spot] I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy.
Silence.
Principal Victoria
I send my five dollars a month, see?
Demonstrating her Teiko watch.
Stan
This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.
Cartman
Oh well, back to the poor country with you.
Kyle
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
Cartman
B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.
Genetic Engineering Ranch.
Mephesto
I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.
Chef
Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.
Mephesto
Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.
Chef
Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.
Mephesto
Oh, whoops.
He quickly switches slides.
Mephesto
Now tell me what you see.
Chef
Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.
Mephesto
Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing.
Chef
What does it mean?
Mephesto
Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world.
Chef
Oh, fudge!
Chef ponders for a moment.
Chef
Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.
Mephesto
Sure.
He switches slides again.
Cartman's house. Marvin is sitting alone on the couch watching TV. Secret service agents enter the house. Outside, a helicopter flies around with its searchlight on.
Agent 1
Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch.
Marvin points towards Cartman's room. The agents go forth.
Cartman
Hey, hey, what's going on?!
The agents have him in a duffle bag and are dragging him out of the house.
Cartman
Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
Returning to Marvin.
Agent 1
Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up.
Cartman
Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!
A truck door closes.
Marvin
Sweet.
Outside the Library.
Mayor McDaniels
So how does this thing work?
Aide
Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family.
Mayor McDaniels
POVVVV?
Aide
Poverty stricken citizen.
Mayor McDaniels
Ohhoho, brilliant.
A horde of turkeys rush the square and attack a fake turkey and a Pilgrim hat.
Mayor McDaniels
Daah!! What the hell is this!!
The turkeys go through the crowd attacking people.
Aide
I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program.
Mephesto joins them.
Mephesto
They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.
Chef
It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!
A platoon of turkeys march by.
Chef
Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!
Kyle
Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
Mayor McDaniels, alarmed, steps up to the mic.
Mayor McDaniels
OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!
Jimbo and Ned enter, armed with rifles. They start firing away, and turkeys go down left and right.
Mephesto
We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!
Cartman's House. Marvin is taking up Cartman's habits. On TV, Terrance and Phillip are reenacting the first Thanksgiving.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?
Phillip
Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.
Terrance attempts to squeeze one off.
Terrance
Huh, eh,
Phillip offers to help.
Terrance
wait wait wait.
He tries some more.
Terrance
Eh, eh.
And some more.
Terrance
Here it comes, ehhhh.
A long squeeky fart bursts forth.
Terrance
Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!
Phillip
Aaaah.
Laughter.
Phillip
I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.
Laughter.
Terrance
I spattered his face!
Laughter.
Phillip
Now he's a smelly Indian.
Laughter.
TV Announcer
We'll be back to part 14 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, right after this.
Sally Struthers
Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.
Cartman walking around in the background.
Cartman
Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!
Sally Struthers
So please, call and adopt a child today.
Cartman
I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
Liane
You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?
Marvin
Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof.
Liane
Okay.
Marvin
Sweet.
Ethiopian Desert. A vulture is flying overhead, awaiting its next meal to die.
Cartman
Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.
He approaches a group of Ethiopians.
Cartman
Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?
They stare back blankly.
Cartman
Well, screw you too!
Suddenly in a swarm of flies.
Cartman
What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!
He walks away.
The Library. The B and second R have slipped a bit.
Mayor McDaniels
All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa.
The crowd cheers.
Stan
Hey, where's Cartman?
Kyle
I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?
Marvin shrugs.
Mayor McDaniels
Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.
The crowd cheers.
Mayor McDaniels
Come on, hurry up.
Kenny enters the "Grab-O-Lux"
Mrs. McCormick
Grab a lot son.
Mayor McDaniels
Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!
Air is pumped in to raise the cans, but Kenny goes up as well and floats around. Status indicator flash on and off.
Mayor McDaniels
Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!
Stan, Kyle
Come on, Kenny!
Stuart waving his beer bottle.
Stuart McCormick
Come on, son!
Mayor McDaniels
Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family.
She switches off the Grab-o-lux with the remote control, and Kenny and the cans drop to the floor. He gets up and exits.
Mayor McDaniels
It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- string beans. Hehe.
The crowd cheers, but the sound of turkeys fills the air.
Chef
What the-?!
Stan
Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!
The turkeys charge over a hill.
Officer Barbrady
Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos.
Mephesto
I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen.
Chef comes up and addresses the crown.
Chef
Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...
Chef looks down at Mephesto's companion, Kevin. The turkeys continue their attack.
Chef
What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
Mephesto
That's not important right now.
Chef
No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
Mayor McDaniels
Chef, the turkeys!
Chef
Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!
The turkeys continue their attack.
Chef
We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
Ethiopian Desert. Cartman walks slowly.
Cartman
Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.
He sees a Red Cross van is in the distance. Ethiopians gather round it.
Cartman
Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!
He approaches the van.
Cartman
I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
Red Cross Dude
Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding.
The female partner is putting some things away.
Cartman
What?!
Red Cross Dude
We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up.
Cartman
But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
Now behind the van ready to leave.
Red Cross Dude
Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch.
He tosses Cartman a watch and hops into the van. The van drives off.
Cartman
WEEEEEEAK!!!
In the woods near South Park. The screen is reduced to a wide screen format, so you know a movie reference is coming. The town is assembled for battle as the Mayor speaks.
Mayor McDaniels
People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys.
Townsperson 1
There's too many of them.
Mayor McDaniels
Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!
Townsperson 2
We can't stop them.
Chef rides up on a brown steed. His face is painted blue and white. He is wearing Scottish garb, wielding a sword and shield à la Braveheart.
Chef
Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!
Now pumped for battle.
Crowd
Wooo, yeahhh, woo.
On a nearby hill the pack of turkeys is gathered together. One turkey is also painted in blue and white.
Leader Turkey
Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!
The other turkeys gobble like mad, then sally forth. The town residents stand ready for battle as the turkeys descend into the valley.
Kyle
Here you go turkeys!
Kyle moons the turkey forces.
The town force descends, the mayor and an aide stay behind.
Mayor McDaniels
Does my hair look okay?
Ethiopian Desert. The vulture still circles...
Cartman
Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...
He looks up to the sky for relief.
Cartman
I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.
He falls forward to the ground. After a few seconds he lifts his head.
Cartman
Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.
He sees something. A lone building stands in the distance. Cartman approaches. A sign reads, "No Admittance".
Cartman
Huh, I wonder what's in here?
Cartman opens the door and faces towers of Cheesy Poofs, Snacky Cakes, Boogie Bars and Veal Roll-Ups. "Alleluyah" is playing. Cartman stands in awe, then is overjoyed.
Cartman
SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!
He rubs up against them lovingly. He sees a large-screen TV and a potted plant, and walks towards them. He then looks to his right and sees Sally Struthers feasting on some cake and two Ethiopians fanning her with palm fronds. She sees him and stops eating. Cartman is mad.
Cartman
Sally Struthers?!
Sally Struthers
Who the hell are you?!
Cartman
Gimme that cake!
Sally Struthers
Nooho, this is my cake!
Cartman
No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!
Sally Struthers
NOO! You can't have any!
Cartman
No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!
After some more whining he opens the door and sees some Ethiopians passing by.
Cartman
You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!
They turn to look at him.
Sally Struthers
Uh oh.
She just can't eat that cake fast enough.
South Park Forest. The battle continues. The turkeys fight valiently, but many are falling. Ike beheads a turkey. Marvin looks on and scratches his head.
Chef
Stay close children.
His shield blocks one turkey as he slays another.
Stan, Kyle, Kenny
Yeaaa!
Turkey's rush Kenny.
Kenny
(O-Oh.)
One turkey manages to extract Kenny's eyeball as the others kill him outright. They speed away with pieces of him.
Stan
Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Jimbo
The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned.
Ned picks off the remaining three birds.
Stan
We did it!!
As the town celebrates, some townsfolk are still beating on the birds, one of them with a large mallet.
Mephesto
My God, what have we done?
Chef
We've saved Thanksgiving!
Mephesto
But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead.
Chef
Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.
Mephesto
As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-
Chef
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Two secret service agents approach Chef and Barbrady, ignoring the carnage.
Agent 2
Excuse me sir, we're looking for a little starving Ethiopian boy who was accidentally delivered to South Park instead of a Teiko sports watch.
Showing a picture of Marvin.
Agent 1
Have you seen anyone fitting this description.
Officer Barbrady
Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.
Marvin approaches the two agents.
Agent 1
There you are. Are you ready to go home now?
Marvin looks at Mr. Garrison, then at Chef, then at Officer Barbrady. He quickly shakes an affirmative. The agents lead him away, but he turns back to get some turkeys. Stan and Kyle look on as Kenny's corpse lies motionless behind them.
Stan
Wow, it sucks he has to leave.
Kyle
Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
Stan
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.
Kenny's head moves.
Stan
But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
Kyle
Yeah.
A rat moves in and out of Kenny's empty eye socket, then scurries away.
Kyle
And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
Ethiopian Desert. Three Red Cross workers are present.
Red Cross Chick
We're terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately.
Cartman
That's right you will, God-Damnit.
A male agent checks his watch.
Cartman
Move it POVs, I'm an American!
A plane lands. Marvin exits the plane.
Ethiopian
A baba, gluck gluck bababab ga.
Marvin
Baba gook gook ba.
The cargo door lowers in back of the plane and a bunch of dead turkeys fall out. The Ethiopians grab the turkeys and raise Marvin on their shoulders in triumph. They march away, passing by a spit on which Sally Struthers has been tied, with an apple in her mouth.
Sally Struthers
(What are you doing? Let me off of here!)
Kenny's House.
Stuart
Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us, and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.
Mrs. McCormick
Amen.
She takes a brief look around.
Mrs. McCormick
Does anybody have a can opener?
Stuart
God Damn-it.

Class
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year!

Stan steps forth from the choir and heads towards center stage.
Stan
Lights, please.
The lights dim. He steps into the spotlight and quotes from the Gospel of Luke (2:8-11,14).
Stan
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,
keeping watch over their flocks by night.
And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them,
and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them,
'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy,
for born unto you this day in the city of
...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace,
goodwill towards men'

And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus.
Stan steps aside while presenting the Nativity scene. The curtains open, and nine students stand in and around the grotto. Kenny is the angel floating above the manger, Wendy is Mary, about to give birth; Kyle is Joseph, ready to receive Jesus; Cartman is one of the three shepherds on the left side of the stage, and three Wise Men stand on the right side. Wendy is simulating birth pangs.
Wendy
Unh [labored breathing] Oh!
Kyle
Come on, Mary! Push!
Wendy
Aaaah!
Kyle
I can see its head!
Wendy
UUuuhh-UUuuhh.
A doll pops out beside Mary and flips through the air. Joseph catches it.
Kyle
It's a boy!
Unfortunately, he's now holding the doll wrong.
Cartman
Oohhhh!
Kenny
(Kyle has Jesus' head instead!)
Mr. Garrison
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you?
Kyle
...Sorry.
Mr. Garrison
And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains.
Wendy
Okay.
Sheila approaches Mr. Garrison.
Sheila
Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Mr. Garrison
Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head.
Mary and Joseph are now looking at them argue.
Sheila
How dare you include the Nativity in a school play? Don't you realize my son is Jewish?!
Kyle drops his head.
Mr. Garrison
...So?
Sheila
So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
Mr. Garrison
Because it's Christmas???
Sheila
Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
All the kids gasp.
Mr. Garrison
Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you?
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!
Cartman
Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
Kyle shoots back.
Kyle
Shut up, fat boy!
Cartman
I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.
Stan
Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?
Mr. Garrison
Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?
Sheila
How about the dreidel song, bubbe?
Kyle
I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
Mr. Garrison
The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?
Kyle
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-

Stan
Christmas Poo?
Cartman
What the hell is Christmas Poo?
Kyle
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
Sheila
Kyle, that is enough!
Mr. Garrison
See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan.
Sheila
Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.
Mr. Garrison interrupts and follows her
Mr. Garrison
Oh wait wait wait. I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark?
Wendy gets up.
Wendy
You guys, look! It's snowing!
Snow is seen through a window. The kids step out of costume and rush out of school to take advantage of this opportunity, cheering all the way.
In the school playground.
Stan
Whoa, Christmas snow!
Wendy
Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue.
A soft instrumental starts up.
Wendy
It's fun.
The kids shuffle back and forth catching snowflakes. When Kenny looks up an eagle passes overhead and dumps a load - right on Kenny's face.
Cartman is watching with glee.
Kenny
P'tooui.
Stan
That was sick, dude!
Cartman seeing Kyle lolling for a snowflake.
Cartman
Hey!
Kyle is taken aback
Cartman
What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
Kyle
We can, too!
Stan
...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
Kyle
Officer Barbrady!
Officer Barbrady
What?
A car screeches to a halt as Officer Barbrady raises his arm.
Kyle
Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
After a long pause.
Officer Barbrady
Yyess.
Kyle
Damnit!
Stan
Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Cartman
Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
Kyle
No. But I get Hanukkah presents for eight days.
Cartman
Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
Stan
We'll catch up with you later, Kyle.
Stan walks off with Wendy and the others.
Kyle
Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Stan
Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?
Kyle
Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Cartman
Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now.
Kyle
Well! You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
Cartman
You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle.
Cartman and walks away.
Stan
See you around, dude.
Stan follows Cartman away.
Kyle is left alone in the playground as winds howl around him. The camera zooms in on him as the intro to his song plays.
Kyle
It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas...

He walks away, then peeks at the mall from behind a tree. Stan is on Santa's lap while Cartman and Kenny wait in line, now forming on Santa's left.
Kyle
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas.

He walks down the road, past a Toy Shoppe and a stand of Christmas trees. The camera pulls back as he walks out of view.
Outside City Hall a crowd gathers.
Mayor McDaniels
Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down.
Large woman
Mayor, we are deeply offended by the Nativity scene in front of the capital office. Church and State are separate!
Some men
No! Wrong!
Kyle appearing among his friends.
Kyle
What's going on, you guys?
Stan
The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet.
Sheila
That isn't all, Mayor! The school play is doing a Nativity scene! It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!
Mr. Garrison
You are the Jewish community!
Crowd
Yeah! Yeah!
Cartman
Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!
Kyle
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Father Maxi
Mayor, the Nativity is what Christmas is all about. If you remove Christ, you must remove Santa and Frosty and all of that garbage, too!
The crowd cheers in agreement.
Woman
Hallelujah!
Man
Amen!
Tree hugger
And we must put a stop to the cutting down of Christmas trees!
Man 1
Raah!
Man 2
Give me a break!
Uncle Jimbo
And I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids. If you don't want to spill your coffee, you shouldn't be driving with it.
The crowd processes Jimbo's words.
Crowd
Yeah! Yeah!
Mayor McDaniels
Okay, people, we clearly need to reach a compromise. Perhaps we need a new icon for Christmas.
Assistant 1
Oooo, brilliant idea, Mayor!
The crowd mulls over the suggestion.
Kyle
Hey! How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
Mayor McDaniels
Ex-cuse me?
Kyle
Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Sheila
Kyle! Sshhh!
Kyle
It's true. He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-

Cartman
[stopping Kyle] Never mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy.
Kenny
(Kyle's crazy!)
Stan
Yeah.
Sheila
Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww.
Sheila drags him away.
Kyle
Wait...
Mayor McDaniels
Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions?
Mr. Garrison raises his hand.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Can we get rid of all the Mexicans?
Looks back, then.
Mayor McDaniels
No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans.
Mr. Garrison
Rats!
Kyle's house, the living room. Ike opens up his present - a dreidel. He gives it a spin. The camera pans to the right and stops at Kyle and his dad.
Gerald Broflovski
It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!
Sheila pops out from behind Gerald.
Sheila
Your father's right, Kyle.
Gerald
Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!
Sheila pops out again.
Sheila
Listen to your father, Kyle.
The dreidel has gone off to the right, and Ike goes after it, bumping into the coffee table. The Channukah menorah on it (day 6) falls on Ike, and he begins to burn.
Gerald
Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'.
Kyle
But dad, he always sh...
Gerald
Say it!
Kyle
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Gerald
Again!
Kyle
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Sheila pops out again.
Sheila
This is for your own good, bubbe.
Gerald
Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!
Kyle
[softly, under his breath] Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.
Gerald
What did you say?!
Kyle enters his room.
Kyle
I said Ike's on fire!
Ike
Oh oh. On flame? Oh oh. On flame?
Sheila
Oh my God!
Gerald quickly smothers Ike with a blanket to douse the flames.
Kyle's house, the bathroom. He is brushing his teeth.
Kyle
It isn't fair! I don't want to be an outcast!
A voice is echoing from the toilet
Voice
Kyle.
Kyle faces the toilet, then returns to brushing his teeth.
Kyle
I'm not hearing that.
Voice
Kyle.
Kyle hops down and goes to the toilet, then looks into it.
Kyle
Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey pops up and makes his entrance wearing white gloves and a red elf cap.
Mr. Hankey
Howwwwdy-hoooo.
Mr. Hankey jumps onto the sink.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell.
Kyle
[now wary] Go away, Mr. Hankey.
Mr. Hankey
You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers.
Kyle
I said go away! My father said you aren't real.
Mr. Hankey
Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song?
He begins to sing. As he does so, he skips around the room and leaves bits of poo behind.
Mr. Hankey
Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'.

Kyle
Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
Mr. Hankey
Folks'll gather round the fire
sing a song, stroll the choir
Pretty song they'll all retire
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'.

He leaves 'NOEL' written in poop on the vanity mirror.
Gerald knocks on the door.
Gerald
Kyle, what are you doing in there?
Kyle
Nothing.
He knocks again.
Gerald
Open this door!
Mr. Hankey
I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we...

Kyle
Mr. Hankey, come here.
Kyle grabs Mr. Hankey and muffles him, and turns as Gerald opens the door. Gerald sees a bathroom smeared with feces everywhere, and a boy facing him holding a big piece of it in his left hand. He gasps and remains speechless.
Gerald
KYLE!
Kyle throttles the poo.
Kyle
Say something, Mr. Hankey!
It falls over, and Kyle looks forsaken.
Kyle's bedroom. Kyle is now in bed.
Gerald
Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?!
Gerald looks towards his room and quickly closes the door.
Mr. Hankey is now on Kyle's comforter.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho!
Kyle
Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go?
Mr. Hankey
You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold.
Kyle
Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
Mr. Hankey
Aw, gee, that's too bad.
Kyle
Hey! How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
Mr. Hankey
Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas.
Kyle
Yeah! We'll show them!
Kyle smiles, pleased with the idea.
Downtown South Park.
Mayor McDaniels
Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group!
The crowd sets about dismantling the decorations. A man removes Santa's head from his sleigh and tosses it onto the street.
Uncle Jimbo calls forth from his shop.
Uncle Jimbo
Is mistletoe offensive?
Mayor McDaniels
Is anyone offended by mistletoe?
One man raises his hand.
Mayor McDaniels
Lose the mistletoe!
Jimbo clips it off.
Bus stop.
Stan
You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
Cartman
How do you know?
Stan
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
Cartman
Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.
Stan
What's that?
Cartman
I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
Kyle arrives.
Kyle
Hello, everybodyyy.
Stan
What's in the box, dude?
Kyle
It's a surprise.
Cartman
Let me see!
The boys gather around the box.
Kyle
O-Okay. But don't scare him...
A shot of what Mr. Hankey sees as Stan pops the lid open, then a top-down view as the poo is shown in all its glory. Cartman and Stan blink.
Stan
[angrily] Dude, sick!!!
Kyle looks down at his poo.
Cartman
Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
Kenny
(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
Kyle
Wait! You guys! He's alive!
Kyle jostles the box.
Stan
Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
Kyle is shaking the box now.
Kyle
Come on, dance! Daaance! Dance, damn you!!
Research Center, a Researcher is shown before at least six subjects.
Researcher
Now this is very simple. I'm going to say words and the computer will measure how offended you are by them. In this way we can find out which words are least offensive for use in the holiday season. Are we ready?
The group looks back at him.
Researcher
Here we go: Christ
Two responses.
Researcher
Hm. Okay. Cherub.
No response.
Researcher
Hm... Camel
One response.
Researcher
Hm. Sad.
No response.
Researcher
Stupid Wop Dago.
All respond.
Researcher
Bench...
South Park Elementary, the school gym. The janitors are clearing out the decorations.
Mr. Garrison
Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?
Janitor 2
Mayor's orders.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus.
Cartman
Thanks to Kyle's mother.
Kyle
Shut up, Cartman!
Mr. Garrison
So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.
Cartman raises his hand.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, Eric?
Cartman
How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.
Kyle
I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Cartman
O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch,
she's a big fat bitch,
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch,
if there ever was a bitch,
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.

Kyle
Shut up, Cartman!
Mr. Hankey pops to life.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho!
Kyle
[hushed] Mr. Hankey.
Cartman
Monday she's a bitch,
on Tuesday she's a bitch,
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different,
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!

The class is clapping along gleefully by now, while Kyle looks at Cartman with ire.
Mr. Hankey
Golly, that isn't very nice.
Kyle turns to hear him.
Mr. Hankey
I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.
Mr. Garrison joins in the clapping, but he's off beat.
Cartman
Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom? 
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BIIIIII-I-I-ITCH - aahh.

Kyle
Mr. Hankey, no!
Mr. Hankey
Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!!
Mr. Hankey attacks Cartman.
Mr. Garrison
What the...
The poo is now on the floor, and the class gasps.
Cartman
Gross, Kyle!
Mr. Garrison
Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric?
Kyle
Uuuuuuhh...
Cartman
YOU SICK BASTARD!
Some snickers are heard.
The counselor's office, the window showing silhouettes of Kyle and Mr. Mackey. Another student waits outside.
Mr. Mackey, Jr.
Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?
Kyle
I don't have a problem.
Mr. Mackey
Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.
Kyle
What's that?
Mr. Mackey
Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.
Kyle
Mookie-stinks?
Mr. Mackey
Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?
Kyle
Wull, not on purpose.
Mr. Mackey
So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya?
Kyle
Well, sometimes...
Mr. Mackey
And that must make you mad.
Kyle
Well sure.
Mr. Mackey
Mad enough to kill, Kyle???
Mr. Mackey looks at him up close.
Kyle
No, dude!
Mr. Mackey
Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?
Kyle
But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
Mr. Mackey
Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have.
Mr. Mackey sips from his coffee cup, Mr. hankey is now bathing in the cup.
Mr. Hankey
Kyle!
Kyle lowers his head.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho.
Kyle is shocked.
Mr. Mackey
Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?
Kyle looks back up in horror at the counselor, who takes another sip of coffee. Kyle closes his eyes in dread anticipation. Mr. Hankey is still bathing in Mr. Mackey's coffee.
Mr. Hankey
Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way...

Mr. Mackey
To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac...
Mr. Mackey notices the poo in his cup and gasps.
Mr. Mackey
Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey!
Kyle's mouth is twisted with chagrin.
South Park Elementary, the school gym. Christmas lights are still hanging and lit.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy...
Students
Hhmm.
Mr. Garrison
...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?
a low faucet is dripping next to the outlet, creating a puddle that goes past it. The class looks at the sight, then Kenny goes over...
Mr. Garrison
Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.
Kenny tugs at the cords and they come out. He looks at the class, then walks back to his spot.
Mr. Garrison
Okay. Now let's practice our...
Mr. Mackey rushes in, followed by Kyle.
Mr. Mackey
No! Get away from me!
Kyle
Here. Just look more closely at it.
Mr. Mackey
No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay?
South Park Mental House.
Stan
Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
Nurse
Reason?
Kyle
I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
Nurse
Any allergies?
Kyle
No.
Nurse
Jacket!
Two burly men come out through the doors on either side of the nurse and wrap Kyle up, then take him inside, chattering all the while.
Cartman
Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!
South Park Elementary, the school gym.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on?
They do, and just look back. The camera now looks out to the audience.
Artsy Man
Good, it looks like they have taken the Christmas trees down.
His Date
Yes, and there's nothing Christian, either. This should be great!
Sheila
Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it.
Sheila is now sobbing.
South Park Mental House.
Kyle
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...

South Park Elementary, the school gym. The MC is on stage.
MC
Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday...
Man 1
[pointing] Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage. That's very offensive to non-Christians.
Uncle Jimbo
Oh, come on!
Man 1
Hey! Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!
Randy Marsh
I agree.
Mr. Garrison peeks through the curtain.
Mr. Garrison
Oh brother.
He steps back.
Mr. Garrison
Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?
Kenny approaches the ladder and starts climbing.
Mr. Garrison
And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there.
Kenny looks down at the pool.
Kenny
(Hunh?)
He looks back at Mr. Garrison.
MC
Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday Experience. Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef.
Chef
I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights.

Kenny reaches the star and makes sure he's safe.
Chef
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
You can break my heart, and that means...

Stan
I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him.
Chef
...We should make love,

Cartman
Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
Chef
...'Cause if we don't-

Mr. Garrison
Okay, kids, get ready to take your places.
The crowd cheers.
MC
Thank you, Chef!
Kenny finally descends with the star.
Kenny
(Phew!)
MC
And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass!
Philip Glass moves into position and start playing his keyboards. The curtains draw back, and the kids look out at the audience. They begin to move around.
Voice-over
As I turn and look into the sun, the rays burn my eyes.
A track saying "Happy Happy Happy, Everybody Happy" is added, along with an arpeggio. Members of the audience look confused.
Voice-over
How like a turtle the sun looks.
Sheila
What the hell is this???
The kids just keep moving and turning.
Sheila
This is horrible!!!
Father Maxi
This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!!
Mr. Garrison
You're the ones who made it this way!
Father Maxi
Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian.
Gerald
It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus!
Elderly Tree Hugger
All you bastards ruined Christmas!
The crowd descends into brawling. A person in blue is thrown towards the stage. The Broflovskis trap Father Maxi.
Gerald
Get him in the ribs!
Sheila punches Father Maxi.
Father Maxi
Oof.
Picking up the elderly tree-hugger.
Man in audience
Damn tree-hugger!
Tosses him away.
Stan
This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
Wendy
Yeah.
Chef is now on stage behind the children.
Chef
Say, where's Kyle?
Stan
We committed him.
Chef
What? Why?
Cartman
'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
Chef
Chirstmas poo? You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.
Stan
Huh?! O-oh.
The crowd continues to brawl. Sheila uses a chair on her husband, who quickly falls to the floor. She watches him fall.
A Mr. Hankey Commercial Plays.
Back at the gym. The man in blue is thrown from his post for the third time - an obvious blooper, as the Broflovskis have Father Maxi trapped again.
Stan
This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
Chef
Well! You can believe in him now.
A woman backs up across the stage as a man flies towards her. The crowd is more violent now.
Woman
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH.
Stan
I believe.
A piano begins to play softly.
Wendy
I believe in Mr. Hankey.
A shoebox at one side of the stage starts to jump, and the lid pops off. Mr. Hankey jumps up and floats in the air, surrounded by pixie dust.
Mr. Hankey
Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!
Everyone on stage gasps.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery.
Cartman, Stan
Whoa!!
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho, Chef!
Chef
Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!
Cartman
Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!
Moves toward stage left.
Cartman
Talking poo is where I draw the line!
Mr. Hankey
What's all the ruckus?
Chef
I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey. The whole town is about to kill each other.
Mr. Hankey
I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!
He sees the crowd fighting and whistles. They stop and turn to see him.
Mr. Hankey
STOP FIGHTING!!
The Mayor
Oh my God, what the hell is that thing?
Mr. Hankey
Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, "Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies".
Father Maxi finally gets up from the floor as a single person begins to clap, and the crowd turns to see that the person clapping is Gerald. Then others start clapping and the town begins to cheer. Mr. Hankey is overjoyed at the response.
Stan
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
South Park Mental House. Kyle sits on the floor of a padded room.
Kyle
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...

Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!
Thinking it's a hallucination.
Kyle
Oh no, I'm not sane yet!
Mr. Hankey
I brought some friends with me.
Kyle
Friends?
Kyle gets up and looks lout a small window. He sees all the townsfolk and smiles, relieved.
Townsfolk
Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!
Kyle
You mean you can see him? Ah-I'm not crazy?
The nurse releases him and he rushes out the door. Mr. Hankey follows.
Townsfolk
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo...

Mr. Hankey kisses Kyle.
Townsfolk
...he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you...

Mr. Hankey begins tossing presents to everyone.
Townsfolk
...Even if you're a Jew

Mr. Pirrip
Sometimes he's nutty, sometimes he's corny,
he can be brown or greenish-brown
But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve,
he might come to your town

Townsfolk
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
He loves me. I love you
Heeeeeeee Looooooves Yoooooouu!

Mr. Hankey, during the second chorus.
Mr. Hankey
Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas.
He floats up to meet Santa as he passes by.
Cartman
Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!
Santa Claus
Howdy-ho ho ho!
Stan
You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too.
Kyle
Yeah...[concerned] You know, it seems like something's still not right.
The camera pans over to Kenny.
Cartman
Yeah, something feels...unfinished.
Drum roll.
Stan
Wh-what could it be?
The drum roll heads for a climax.
THE END.
Kenny
(Yee he hee!)
End credits roll.
South Park Public Access. A light is on.
Jesus is on the Jesus and Pals set alone.
Jesus
Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...

Jesus blows out the candle on his cake and ends up in the dark. He blinks. Credits resume rolling.

Cartman
Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
Kyle
What is this, Cartman?
Cartman
They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
Stan
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Cartman
Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...
Kyle
Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
Cartman
That's right.
Stan
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too.
Cartman
That's ri-aayy.
Pip
Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation.
Cartman
[darting over] Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!
Pip smiles hopefully.
Cartman
I shoved it up my ass!
Pip's hopes are dashed.
Cartman
Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!
moves on
Cartman
Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
Mr. Garrison
[excitedly] Children, children! Today is a very special day.
Cartman
No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
Mr. Garrison
I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.
Cartman
Eeeeeeh!
Mr. Garrison
Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate... [leans down to the new kid, Damien] uh-uh, what's your name again?
Damien Thorn
Damien!
Ominous Voice
Rectus...dominus...

Dark music and changing plays as Damien's eyes show flaming, crackling pupils.
Mr. Garrison
Say 'hi' to Damien! [Silence.] And where are you from, Damien?
Damien
The seventh layer of hell!
Mr. Garrison
Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama.
Damien goes around the teacher's desk and hops up on it, kicking away the apple. Garrison steps aside.
Damien
My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father!
Ominous Voice
... rectus... cheesy poofs...

Mr. Garrison
Your father?
Damien
The Prince of Darkness!
Mr. Garrison
Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era.
Damien hops down and goes to sit next to Cartman.
Mr. Garrison
Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...
Cartman
Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
Damien
Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
Cartman
Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?
Ominous Voice
Rectus... dominus...

Damien turns to Cartman and concentrates. Cartman's desk suddenly turns over and dumps him onto the floor.
Cartman
Byah. Oof!
The desk goes out the window. The class sits up.
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Ominous Voice
Sancti...

Kyle
Damn, what a freak!
Cartman
[Getting up off the floor.] Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!
Ominous Voice
Cheesy poofs...

Damien
Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.
Mr. Garrison
Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes?
Damien blinks.
Cartman
Eheh. [Taunting.] You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
The cafeteria: The boys already have their lunches.
Stan
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
Kyle
Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
Cartman
Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
Stan
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
Kyle
Yeah, that's weak!
Cartman
Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
Stan
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.
Kyle crumples up the invitation and throws it away.
Cartman
Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
Stan
Oh great, Green Mega Man it is.
Cartman
Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is.
Damien arrives.
Stan
Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
Cartman
Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
Damien
Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
Kyle
You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!
Damien walks off.
Cartman
Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.
Stan and Kyle laugh, then Cartman laughs. Kenny punches him.
Cartman
Eeyy!
Damian walks over to where Pip is.
Pip
Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.
Damien
Then I will call you Pip.
Pip
Right-o.
Stan
Hey new kid!
Cartman turns around. Kenny is already facing him.
Stan
Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
Kenny
(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)
Damien
That does it! Woo-paah.
Points his index fingers at Kenny.
Ominous Voice
... rectus... dominus...

Kenny trembles for a moment, and then a moment of silence.
Stan
What the... ?
Kyle
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
Stan
A what?
Kenny
Quack-quack.
Cartman
Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
Chef comes up behind them.
Chef
Hello there, children.
Stan
Hey, Chef.
Chef
How's it going?
Kyle
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Kyle
Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
Chef
Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song,
We're all special in our own way
everybody's different, but that's okay,
'cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin,
different points of view, be tall or thin,
it doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin,

A psychedelic scene appears behind him.
Chef
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been,

He stands behind a lovely black woman wearing trunks and a big smile.
Chef
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...

He floats on a cloud with a lovely white woman, then he's back in the cafeteria
Chef
What were we talking about again?
Kyle
The new kid.
Damian is standing on a table.
Damien
Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all!
Ominous Voice
Rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs...

Pip's cap flies off, followed by milk and lunch trays, large tote bags, wall poster, clocks...
Stan
Whoa!
Chef
Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker!
...Footballs, bunnyfish, desks, telephones, fire alarms, rifles...
Kyle
We told you, dude.
Kids scream. Pip is awestruck. Kids and lunch tables begin to rise and fly around.
Chef
We've got to do something, children!
Mr. Hankey flies by, then Kevin Stoley, then a cow. (think Twister)
Damien
Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus!
Ominous Voice
... rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs... rectus... dominus...

Stan, Kyle
Jesus?
The set of Jesus and Pals. Jesus freshens up, and Roland the cameraman comes in
Roland
Two minutes to air, Jesus.
Jesus
Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou. [Stan and Kyle dash in.]
Stan
Jesus, Jesus!
Jesus
Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.
Stan
No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
Kyle
Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
Kenny
Quack-quack.
Jesus
Wow. That's pretty heavy.
Stan
This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
Jesus
The Dark Prince?
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
Yeah.
Jesus
So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.
Stan
[To Kyle.] Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
Jesus
Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.
Kyle
... K.
School playground
Groundskeeper
Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!
Cartman is heard speaking. Three kids look at him: Wendy, Clyde, and the Boy with the blue cap, who is taking notes. Cartman stands next to an easel, pointing at drawings he made earlier. A boy with a blue hat joins them later
Cartman
Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money...
A football lands in front of Damien, who sets fire to it. He then points to the slide, which catches fire and sends Red into another student as Bebe looks on.
Ominous Voice
Rectus... dominus... sancti...

Red
Aaaaa Bebe!
Bebe
Our slide!
Damien
Feel my wrath!
Damien sends a small fireball from his fingertip to the see-saw, setting it aflame and knocking off Kevin Stoley and Token.
Damien torches the hobby elephants. A boy with a brown hat screams as fire is set to the hobby elephant he's playing on.
Pip
[As Damien torches the hobby elephants.] Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.
Damien
I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan!
He torches the jungle gym. Butters screams as he falls off.
Pip
Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.
Ominous Voice
... Rectus... cheesy poofs...

Jesus
Damien!
Damien
Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!
Jesus
So it is thou, Son of Lucifer!
Damien
Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes.
Jesus
Let him come then. I shall stop him!
Damien
Behold! He is already upon us! [Clouds begin to conceal the sun.
Kyle
Ohh, dude!
Satan
Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
Another whirlwind comes up.
Jimbo
What the hell's going on here?
A crowd begins to gather.
Father Maxi
Look! It's that guy from the public access show!
Blonde
What's happening?
Chef
Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!
Garrison leans onto him.
Chef
Not you, dammit!
Satan
Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
Damien
Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!
Jesus
Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!
Jimbo
Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!
The Crowd disperses.
Stan
You're gonna fight Satan?
Jesus
This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.
Commercial
Who will win our souls?
An hourglass spins on a horizontal axis.
Commercial
Our Savior and Lord?
Jesus launches a fireball into the darkness.
Commercial
Or the Prince of Darkness?
A red demon looms over several fleeing people.
Commercial
It's the final battle between Good and Evil.
A black figure and a white one bump heads.
Commercial
And it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95.
Cartman's house. The boys have just seen the commercial
Cartman
Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
Kenny
Quack-quack.
Stan
[To Kyle.] I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
Cartman
Cartman's birthday!
Kyle
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
Cartman
You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
Stan
Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in.
Cartman
Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
Main St. A crowd is gathered for the weigh-in. Jesus waits for him, too
Father Maxi
When is Satan gonna show up?
The boys rush up.
Stan
Did the Devil show up yet?
Jesus
Not yet.
Kyle
Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
Jesus
... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
Cartman
Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
Jesus
Oh.
Jimbo
We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince.
The crowd cheers.
Jesus
Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation.
Father Maxi
You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus.
More cheering. A pillar of fire appears.
Ominous Vocie
Rectus... dominus...

Jesus
Behold. The Evil One approaches.
Satan
Yeah.
He appears, and the crowd gasps at his size.
Mr. Garrison
Holy poop on a stick!
Satan
Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain!
Stan
Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.
Jimbo
Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
Satan
Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits!
Jesus
Oh - oh yeah??
Man in crowd
Damn.
Satan
I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee.
Jesus
Oh yeah??
A scale is brought in, and Satan is directed to stand on it.
Announcer
Satan weighs in at - 320 lbs, 4 oz.
The crowd gasps. Satan steps off, and Jesus steps on.
Announcer
Jesus Christ weighs in at - 135 lbs., 1 oz.
The crowd lets out a long sigh of disappointment.
Chef
Ooh crap.
Jesus
Aw, come on! I weigh more than that.
Satan
Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world.
The clouds gather behind him. He then turns and walks away.
Jimbo
[Holding his ticket up.] Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too.
Father Maxi
Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck.
The crowd breaks up.
The Sports Book $. Two screens are showing horse races
Man 1
Change my bet!
Man 2
I'm betting on the Devil!
Jimbo
I wanna change my bet to Satan.
Ned
Me, too.
Mr. Garrison
Wai-wa I was here first.
South Park Elementary, Mr. Mackey's office. Damien is in
Mr. Mackey
Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, m'kay?
Damien
Everybody hates me!
Mr. Mackey
Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
Damien
Because I'm the son of the Devil?
Mr. Mackey
Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?
Damien
Because I... burn them and kill them?
Mr. Mackey
Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. And no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. You be passive, m'kay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now.
The playground. Bebe, Kevin Stoley, Butters, and Clyde surround Pip.
Clyde
I bet I can spit the most on him.
Spits, and it lands on Pip's left shoulder.
Bebe
Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.
Spits, and it lands on his right eye.
Pip
Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
Stan
Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'.
Cartman
[Sees Damien coming.] Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
Damien
I apologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice.
A sequence of blinks hints as to the boys' response. Cartman moves closer to Damien.
Cartman
[Farts and moves away.] Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice!
Damien is angry, but restrains himself.
Stan
Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
Kyle
Yeah. We're gonna call you Fart-boy from now on.
Stan
Bubye, Fart-boy.
Kyle
See ya.
Pip
Good day, Damien. How are you?
Damien
Those guys farted on me, and then called me-
Pip
Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
Skeeter's bar; people are having drinks. Chef is at the bar talking to someone. Jesus throws open the doors and enters
Jesus
Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-
Chef
Oh ooh.
A woman at a nearby table whistles the same thing.
Jesus
I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.
Two men at the bar look at each other.
Jesus
In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!
Father Maxi
You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!
Jesus
Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
Father Maxi
Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus.
Jesus
I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
Father Maxi
Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.
Jimbo
Yeah.
Father Maxi
Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later.
Jesus turns and walks out.
Father Maxi
What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, crazy.
Bill Allen and Fosse McDonald's fathers chortle behind him.
Mr. Allen
He's so gay.
Mr. McDonald
Yeah.
The two men seen earlier toast the comments, and Jesus looks in once more.
Jesus
You're all a bunch of Judases!
Outside the bar. Jesus runs into Stan, Kyle, and Kenny
Stan
Hey, Jesus.
Jesus
What are you doing out so late, kids?
Kyle
We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
Jesus
Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right?
Stan
Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
Kyle
Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
Jesus
No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?
Satan's press conference. At least three television stations (4, 11, and 38) have crews present.
Reporter 1
Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?
Satan
I will crush him like a little bug!
Reporter 2
Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War?
Satan thinks a moment, then begins to answer, but a hand covers his mouth.
Don King
Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring.
A training room. Jesus is working on a punching bag while Stan and Kyle look on. Cartman enters.
Cartman
You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
Stan
Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.
Jesus
No way, dude!
Chef
[In the ring.] Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
Stan
But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
Kyle
Yeah, you have to hit him.
Jesus
Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.
Chef
Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
Jesus
Give it your best sho- [Poof.] Oh! [Falls back to the floor.]
Chef
Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
Jesus
Anybody get the number of that truck? [Drops his head.]
Cartman's birthday party; several balloons are tethered to the banner. Carnival music plays. Two elephants are present, as is the Ferris wheel, all in the backyard.
Liane
Come on, kiddies. Eat more.
Cartman is greeting children as they come in with his presents.
Cartman
Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
Chef
Yup! Here's your present, children.
Hands Cartman his gift.
Chef
Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later.
Kyle
Hey, you just got here, Chef!
Chef
I know, but the fight is starting.
Stan
Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
Liane turns to see what Stan said, and sees Chef.
Liane
Mmmmm.
Chef
Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
On the sidewalk in front of Cartman's house, Damien and Pip sit.
Damien
I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
Pip
Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.
Damien
The other kids have always hated you?
Pip
Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me.
Damien gets an idea.
South Park Forum.
Michael Buffer
In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!
The crowd cheers.
Michael Buffer
And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!
The crowd now cheers for Satan. Jesus turns and glowers at them, and they shrink away.
Michael Buffer
Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!
Referee
Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles.
The bell rings.
Cartman's birthday party. A carny does tricks. Damien enters with Pip in tow.
Cartman
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
Stan
Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
Kyle
And neither were you, Pip!
Pip
Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-
Damien
Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party.
His eyes flare up again.
Ominous Voice
Rectus... dominus...

Damien taps Pip on the shoulder and the ground opens up.
Small demons grab Pip.
Ominous Voice
... Sancti... cheesy poofs...

Pip
Aaaa!
He is launched like a rocket.
Pip
Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee!
He gives off fireworks.
Kyle
Wow!
Stan
Whoa, that was cool!
The children, Bebe, Wendy, and Clyde among them, look up and are duly impressed. They applaud.
Kyle
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
Cartman
Yeah. Come on in and join the party. [Damien is pleased]
South Park Forum, round 2. Satan and Jesus meet up. Satan gives Jesus a hard left, throwing him against the ropes. The crowd cheers. Jesus looks back, and they are silent. Jesus turns to fight, but receives a blow in the abdomen, again stumbling to the ropes. Satan gives him a left cross. Satan stands back, and Jesus' halo now flutters all over the place.
Satan
Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!
Cartman's birthday party. He is now opening his presents.
Cartman
Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. [Stan leaves.] And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.[She leaves.] Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?! [Thumps the table in anger.]
Kyle
It's a game, dude. It's really fun.
Cartman
YOU SON OF A BITCH! [Lunges towards Kyle.]
Kyle
[As he is pinned by Cartman.] Aaaaa!
Cartman
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! [Slapping him around by now.]
Kyle
They were all out of 'em dude!
Cartman
I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
Cartman
Aah! AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kyle
[Sobbing.] Aaaaaaaa!
Cartman gets up and moves toward the center of the yard.
Cartman
That's it! Party is over!
The kids look glum.
Cartman
Everybody go home!
He turns the party switch off. Music slows to a stop, everything goes dark, and the banner floats away.
Cartman
GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT!
The kids exit the backyard as Cartman announces that the party is over.
Stan and Kyle stop.
Stan
Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
Cartman
Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!
Throws it at Kyle, who is felled by it. The kids regroup in front of the house.
Damien
Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.
Stan
Aaanh, he does this all the time.
Chef
Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!
Pip descends from above.
Pip
Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.
South Park Forum, a later round. Satan gives Jesus a fierce left, launching him into the air and against the ropes again. Jesus comes forward, and Satan gives him a right to the face.
Jesus
Oh!
Backs up helplessly.
Satan
Fight, dammit!
Gives him another right to the face.
Jesus
Oow! [Satan pick him up] Ooooooh!
Satan throws him against the rope, then gives him another right to the face. Jesus now has a swollen left eye.
Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach Jesus' corner.
Stan
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! [The round ends.] You've got to fight, Jesus.
Jesus
Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.
Kyle
Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
Jesus
It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
Stan
Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. [Kyle looks at him.] She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
Kyle
Uuuuh. Stan?
Stan
Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
Kyle
Stan.
Stan
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
Kyle
Stan!
Stan
[Turning to Kyle.] What?
Kyle
Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
Stan
[Thinks a moment.] ... Really?
Kyle
Yeah, dude!
Stan
Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.
Jesus takes a ladleful of water from a pail next to him.
Stan
You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'.
Jesus
... Who said that?
Stan
You did, Jesus.
Jesus ponders these words as he looks at Satan.
Jesus
You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys!
He gets up as the next round begins and fights without his halo.
Kyle
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Stan
Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
Kyle
Hmmm.
Satan takes a couple of swings at Jesus, but Jesus ducks them.
Satan
Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!
Jesus
Okay, pal. You asked for it!
The crowd looks on as Jesus prepares to punch Satan. Jesus delivers the blow, but nothing happens. The sound of escaping air is heard. Stan just buries his head in his hands in disbelief.
Satan protecting his ribs.
Satan
Ooooooh, you got me.
He drops flat on his back.
Referee
One... Two... Three...
Jimbo
No way! He barely touched him!
Referee
... Seven... Eight.
Satan opens his left eye, then closes it again.
Referee
... Nine... Ten. You're out!
The match ends, and Jesus jumps up in victory.
Stan, Kyle
Our Savior!
Michael Buffer
The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!
Satan pops right back up.
Mr. Garrison
Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!
Jimbo
Yeah!
Satan
Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?
The crowd wonders.
Satan
Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA!
Satan dances out of the ring.
Father Maxi
I don't believe this!
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, what a mean thing to do!
Satan
[Now on the Forum floor.] Farewell, fools!
Jimbo
Man, that guy is a jerk.
Satan dances away and Stan enters the ring.
Stan
[Over the microphone.] Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
Mr. Garrison
Boy, did we get screwed.
Chef
Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
Jesus
Aw heck. [Puts his halo back on.] Do I have a choice?
The crowd cheers with relief.
Jimbo
Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!
Kenny is highlighted.
Jimbo
Ih-it's comin' right for us!
Jimbo pulls out a semi-automatic and fires away at Kenny. Kenny is soon on the floor with his head blown off.
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
Kyle
You bastard!
Damien
Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you.
Rats swarm all over Kenny's head.
Stan
You're leaving already?
Damien
I have to. My dad's always on the move.
The rats leave also.
Stan
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Kyle
Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
Stan
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Cartman's backyard. He's the only one at the picnic table, and it's still full of food. Cartman looks full, though.
Liane
More pie, hon?
Cartman
Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.

Wendy
Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day.
Stan
I know.
Wendy
Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.
Some sentimental music plays.
Stan
I can't afford a cruise, dude.
Wendy
I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise.
Cartman roars with hysterical laughter.
Stan
Shut up, Cartman!
Cartman
[still laughing] That is so-ho lame!
He settles down and wipes away some tears of joy.
Cartman
Oh man, I...
Wendy
-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
Cartman is roaring with laughter once again and falls off his chair.
Cartman
Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
Principal Victoria
[Rushing in.] Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery.
The class erupts in cheers.
Principal Victoria
So you're going to have a substitute teacher.
The class sighs.
Principal Victoria
And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.
Kyle raises his hand.
Principal Victoria
Yes, little boy?
Kyle
We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
Principal Victoria
...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen.
She enters and stands before the class.
Ms. Ellen
[Brightly.] Hello, children.
The boys perk up.
Stan, Kyle
Whoa!
Cartman
[Slowly.] Wow, she's pretty.
Kenny
(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
Stan
You can say that again.
Kenny
(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
Principal Victoria
Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay.
Principal Victoria places it next to the apple.
Ms. Ellen
Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.
The boys get dreamy and smile big, even Kenny.
Ms. Ellen
Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,
The boys are in love.
Ms. Ellen
...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us.
Wendy starts to notice.
Wendy
[Gasps.] Stan? Stan?!
Ms. Ellen
Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?
Cartman
[Brightly.] Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Ellen
Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.
Stan
Yeu-bluuuch.
Wendy is taken aback. Stan has barfed only for her before.
Ms. Ellen
[A moment later.] Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?
Cartman
Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
Stan
I'll kick your ass, Cartman!
Wendy is sad.
Ms. Ellen
So you're alright?
Stan
Bluuuch.
Wendy looks forward, wondering why...
Kyle
Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!
Tom's Rhinoplasty
Mr. Garrison
Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes.
Tom
You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want.
Tom touches the screen, and Mr. Garrison's face pops up, then a side view emerges.
Mr. Garrison
Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
It sure is, Mr. Garrison!
Tom
Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like this.
The nose on his image is shrunk.
Mr. Garrison
Hmmm.
Tom
Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this.
The nose is straightened.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, that's not bad.
Tom
Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this.
The nose is narrowed, at which point an image of David Hasselhoff appears. A flourish is added for effect.
Mr. Garrison
WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
Tom
Alright-y then.
Tom resets the program. The computer turns itself off.
Tom
Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.
Mr. Garrison
I can live with that.
Tom
[Excitedly.] Alrighty then, let's get started!
They go off to the operating room.
The school playground. The kids are at play. The boys stand before the jungle gym.
Cartman
She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!
Kyle
Well that goes without saying, fat-ass, how could she help but look at you!
Stan
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
Cartman
Until you puked on her.
Chef
[Approaching.] Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?
Kyle
Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!
Wendy looks at him from the swings, then looks down.
Chef
Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
Stan
Yeah, that one!
Chef
Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
Wendy
[Approaching.] Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?
Stan
No.
Wendy
Well it is!
Chef
That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
Kenny
(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)
Chef
Thaat's right!
Wendy
Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?
Chef
That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it...
Kenny looks up at Chef and simply shrugs.
Wendy
[Panicking a little.] Stan? We're still Valentines, right?
Stan
Sure, Wendy, whatever.
Kyle
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents
He turns right and starts walking away.
Stan
Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!
Stan follows him out.
Cartman
I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners
Cartman's voice trails off as he follows his friends away. Chef leaves as well, Wendy takes a step to go with them, but stops and ponders her relationship with Stan. A tear wells up in her eye, then falls as she sniffs.
Female singer
I remember when we were still in love
The moments that we shared were timeless.
Saw it in the wind, knew it in a glance,
the songs we sang were simple reminders.

(Montage)
[Moments from Wendy's time with Stan, Part I (he throws up every time)]
Stark's Pond: she comes up behind him and says, "Hi, Stan"
Stark's Pond: she asks him to come with her (to get Cartman)
Cafeteria: she hands him a note (an invitation to Stark's Pond)
Cemetery: amid a field of dead zombies, she puckers up
Classroom: she hands him a daisy (he throws up with every step she takes)
Female singer
I can't stop now
[Wendy is still sobbing]
My heart's awake
I feel your arms
My arms to take
I must have changed...

(Montage)
[Moments from Wendy's time with Stan, Part II (he throws up every time)]
A vivid sunset: she snuggles up to him on the limb of a tree
Football practice: she cheers him on, he throws up, she looks away for an instant, and Cartman tackles him.
Cafeteria: he throws up as she approaches; she slips in it and falls flat on her back
Playground: Stan and Kyle are working those hobby elephants furiously when Wendy and Bebe approach (he threw up on her thrice a time)
Woods: Stan and Wendy pucker up to kiss (after they got Ike back)
Female singer
...Even when love is the same.
[Wendy sheds another tear, then turns left and walks away]

Classroom. Ms. Ellen is writing away on the blackboard. The boys are smiling broadly. The camera zooms in on the reason why. Ms. Ellen stops writing, but the boys are still smiling.
Ms. Ellen
Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?
Cartman
[Eagerly.] Memememememe, me!
Bebe
You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!
Ms. Ellen
Stan, how about you?
Stan
Bluuch! I'd love to.
Wendy turns angry.
Ms. Ellen
Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables.
Cartman raises his hand.
Ms. Ellen
Cartman?
Cartman
What's a multiplication table?
Ms. Ellen
Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?
The class stares back. Kevin slowly shakes his head.
Ms. Ellen
Well, where did he leave off?
Cartman
We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while-
The door opens and Chef appears. The class looks at him.
Chef
Oh, hello.
Ms. Ellen
Can I help you?
Chef
[Eyebrows aflutter.] I'm Chef.
Ms. Ellen
Aand?
Chef
I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
Kyle
My laundry detergent?
Stan
That's not Kyle's...
Chef
Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.
Drops off a box of "Whitey's Washing Detergent" on Kyle's desk, then walks over to Ms. Ellen.
Chef
What was your name again?
Cartman
Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.
Ms. Ellen
I'mm the substitute.
Chef
Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.
Ms. Ellen
That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-
Chef (falsetto)
[Music starts and he starts to sway]
Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!

Stan
We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
Kyle
Yup!
Ms. Ellen
That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?
Chef
If we can have dinner tonight.
Ms. Ellen
Fine, Chef. [He grins.] Just let me do my job before I get fired.
Cartman
Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
Ms. Ellen
Wwhat?!
Tom's Rhinoplasty. Mr. Garrison comes to, but his head is still in bandages.
Tom
Mr. Garrison. Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Where-eh, where am I?
Tom
The operation is over, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look?
Tom
You look great!
Mr. Garrison
Ah-I feel kinda nauseous.
Tom
Yes? Well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction, sawed through some bone, snapped some cartilage...
Mr. Garrison
Aauugh-huh.
Tom
...all the blood and mucus just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart.
Starts making sound effects of tearing flesh.
Mr. Garrison
UUUUUuuuuuugh
Tom
By the way, did you ever see that movie Contact?
Mr. Garrison pops up and turns to the side of the bed.
Mr. Garrison
Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Oh, stop, that movie was terrible!
Tom
I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest.
Mr. Garrison lies down.
Tom
I'll check on you a little later.
Tom walks out.
Mr. Garrison
Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father!
Classroom. The school bell has rung and the kids are leaving
Ms. Ellen
Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do.
Cartman
[Enunciating.] Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.
Kyle
[Looks back.] Stop kissing ass, Cartman!
Cartman
I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut!
The students all exit, except Wendy.
Wendy
Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?
Ms. Ellen
Of course, Wendy.
Wendy sits next to the teacher's desk.
Wendy
I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.
Ms. Ellen
Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life...
Wendy
Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?
Ms. Ellen
Of course, Wendy.
They reach out towards each other. Wendy angrily flips her off.
Wendy
Don't fuck with me!
Ms. Ellen
[Stunned.] Wha?
Wendy
You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!
Ms. Ellen is shocked. Wendy drops from the chair and leaves.
'[Sweetly.] Bye, Ms. Ellen.
Day two, the classroom.
Ms. Ellen
Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me.
A pile of gifts sits on the teacher's desk. Smiles flash onto the boys' faces. She opens the first gift.
Ms. Ellen
Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle.
He's dancing blissfully in his sea.
Stan
[Feigning clearing his throat.] Pf-looser gift, pf-looser gift.
Ms. Ellen
And here's one from Kenny. [She opens it.] Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage.
He laughs, sure that she got the hint.
Ms. Ellen
Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan.
Stan
Bluuch.
Losing patience, Wendy thumps her desk and glares at him.
Ms. Ellen
And here's another present...from Wendy. [She opens it.] Oh. Why, it's a dead animal.
Holds it up for all to see.
Ms. Ellen
Thank you, Wendy.
Wendy is now irate that Ms. Ellen didn't fold.
Stan
See? She liked my present the best!
Kyle
Where's your present, Cartman?
Cartman
Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home.
The left corner of his mouth tells a different story.
Ms. Ellen
Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now. [All gasp.] But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner.
The boys except Cartman perk up.
Cartman
Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.
Ms. Ellen
Are there any questions before we begin?
Wendy raises her hand.
Ms. Ellen
Yes, Wendy?
Wendy
When someone gets as old as you,
Cartman takes a bite out of the chocolate pie.
Wendy
Do they have to wear Depends undergarments?
Ms. Ellen looks dismayed. Wendy just looks back.
The Cafeteria. The boys are in line for lunch
Kyle
Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
Stan
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
Wendy approaches with Bebe, both carrying their lunches.
Wendy
Hi, Stan.
Stan
I bet I scored 100!
Wendy
HI, STAN!
Stan
Oh, hi, Wendy.
Wendy
I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.
Kyle
No, she wasn't!
Wendy
Yes, she was!
Stan
That's impossible!
Wendy
Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!
Cartman
Nuh-uh!
Wendy
It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!
Kyle
Oh cool.
Cartman
Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
Kyle
Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy.
Wendy
NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!!
She realizes she has made a spectacle of herself as her voice echoes all over the room. Everyone in the cafetera looks at her. She moves away, humbled. Bebe follows.
Cartman
Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass.
They go in to get their lunches.
Chef
[Somberly.] Hello there, children.
Cartman
Oh, hi, Chef.
Kyle
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Chef
Not too good.
Stan
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
Chef
No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.
They wait...
Chef
Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.
They just blink at him.
Chef
Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.
Stan
A whatbian?
Kyle
A plebeian?
Chef
You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
Stan
Kenny?
Kenny throws his palms up. He doesn't know, either.
Stan
No, explain it to us, Chef.
Chef
Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.
Stan
Oh.
Chef
Now move along, children, you're holding up the line!
They head back into the cafeteria.
Kyle
Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?
Stan
Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
Kyle
Hey, yeah!
Cartman
You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.
Stan
You're just saying that, Cartman.
Kyle
Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fat-ass.
Cartman
I am, too!
Tom's Rhinoplasty
Tom
Okay, only a few more bandages to go.
Mr. Garrison
Well?
Tom
Take a look for yourself.
Mr. Garrison takes the mirror and sees a reflection of himself - as David Hasselhoff. He will look this way from now on.
Mr. Garrison
Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
I think it looks great.
Tom
Yes. I think once the swelling goes down you'll really notice the difference.
Cartman's house, after school. He's on the living room floor licking the carpet. His friends enter.
Stan
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?
Cartman
My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
Kyle
Really?
Stan
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect.
He pops the CD into the stereo.
Kyle
And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
Stan and Kyle promptly join Cartman on the floor. Kenny studies them for a moment, drops down and thinks a bit, then starts licking.
Indiglo Girls singer
I woke up very early one Sunday morn...

Cartman
This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
Sidewalk. The camera focuses on a pair of feet as they begin to move. The camera pans up to reveal Mr. Garrison walking down the street to the beat of Andy Gibb's Shadow Dancing. He stops by a woman in a yellow blouse and red skirt.
Mr. Garrison
Hi, Mrs. Campbell.
Mrs. Campbell
[Breathlessly.] Oh, How-dy Mr. Garrison. Se-hey, honey, you look kinda differe-hent-huh.
Mr. Garrison
Really?
Mrs. Campbell
Did you get a haircut?
Mr. Garrison
No, but thanks for asking.
He moves down the street.
Mrs. Campbell
[Waving at him.] Call me! I'm in the book!
Mr. Garrison
Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us.
Wendy's house. Bebe is at the door
Wendy
Thanks for coming over, Bebe.
She follows Wendy to the sofa.
Bebe
That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?
Wendy
That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe.
Bebe
Really?
Wendy
Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover.
Bebe
Oh, cool.
Day three, the classroom.
Stan
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
Cartman
I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
Stan
No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.
Kyle
Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!
Clyde
Whoa.
All eyes look right.
Clyde
Is that Wendy Testaburger?
Heads turn. Cartman smiles, Wendy had a makeover all right. She comes in dressed in a two-piece leather suit, blush, eyeshadow... A (candy?) cigarette hangs from her lips and her hair is feathered out. She walks in with an air of sophistication and then takes out the cigarette. A smoky tune plays as she enters. The guys in class are rather pleased at this makeover.
Wendy
Hi guys, what's up?
Cartman
Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John.
Stan smiles and his eyes follow her to her desk.
Stan
Wow. Hi, Wendy.
Wendy
Oh. Hi, Stan.
She turns to Bebe and whispers.
Wendy
I think it worked, Bebe.
Bebe
[Pleased.] Yeah.
Ms. Ellen
Good morning, children.
She, too, comes in wearing a two-piece leather suit.
Stan
Wow!
Wendy and Bebe are devastated.
Cartman
Dang! That's nice!
Kyle
Yeah!
Ms. Ellen
Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!
Wendy is mortified.
Ms. Ellen
We're like sisters!
Wendy
DIE!!
Stan rests his head on his hands and melts into a wavy smile while Cartman is overjoyed.
Ms. Ellen
All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-
Mr. Garrison
Hello there, children!
Shadow Dancing starts up again and he dances. The class just looks at him.
Stan
Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.
Cartman
Oh, weak, dude!
Wendy
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!
Triumphal music plays as she leaps out of her desk and somersaults her way to the teacher's desk. She lands next to Ms. Ellen, she starts doing a little cheer.
Wendy
He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now.
Mr. Garrison
Children, I have a very important announcement to make.
The class listens.
Mr. Garrison
I'm quitting my job as a teacher.
All gasp and the music dies.
Wendy
Wwhat?
Mr. Garrison
It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks.
Wendy
You...you can't.
Mr. Garrison
But the good news is,
Principal Victoria appears at the door.
Mr. Garrison
I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher.
Stan smiles.
Class
Hooray!
Wendy is deflated again.
Ms. Ellen
Really?
Principal Victoria
That's right. Will you stay?
Ms. Ellen
Wel...sure!
Wendy can barely contain herself.
Wendy
Noooo! Noooo!
Ms. Ellen
Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan.
Stan
Bluuch. Kick ass!
Wendy
Nooo!! Nooo!!
Principal Victoria
Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died.
Wendy
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
Principal Victoria
Oh, my! What an exciting day!
Mr. Garrison is in a photo shoot, posing away as Shadow Dancing plays.
Photographer
Great, baby, you're looking great!
Mr. Garrison
I'm a lady killer, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
Photographer
Okay, just a few hundred more shots and we'll be done!
Mr. Garrison
A few hundred?
Photographer
Hey, that's the life of a model, baby.
Mr. Garrison
Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack.
Photographer
You've got it! [The photo-shoot continues.]
Dinner at King Jimmy's Buffet. Stan and Ms. Ellen are at a booth. Dinner music is playing while thunder rolls by.
Ms. Ellen
I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education.
Stan
Are we making love now?
Ms. Ellen
Excuse me?
Stan
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
Ms. Ellen
What are you talking about?
Stan
You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
Ms. Ellen
Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends.
Stan
But why?
Ms. Ellen
Well first of all, you're eight.
Stan
It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
Ms. Ellen
Oh boy.
Wendy stands outside the restaurant looking at the pair through a window clear across the room. The music takes on a somber tone.
Wendy
It's over. I give up.
She turns and walks away.
Day four, the center of town. Mr. Garrsion leans against a mailbox.
Mr. Garrison
Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring.
Mr. Hat
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
A crowd of women is heard coming Garrison's way.
Mr. Garrison
What the...?
The women appear and mob Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.
They rip open his shirt.
Mr. Garrison
Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself!
Mr. Hat flies out of the fray.
The classroom. Students are filing in and going to their seats
Kyle
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Cartman
Did you make love?
Stan
I think so.
Cartman
No way!
Stan
Yup.
Kyle
Down by the fire?
Stan
Yup.
Kenny
(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)
Stan
Did I what?
Ms. Ellen enters.
Ms. Ellen
Good morning, children.
Wendy approaches subdued.
Wendy
Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?
Ms. Ellen
Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?
Wendy
No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.
Ms. Ellen
Oh, that's okay, Wendy.
Wendy
No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends.
Ms. Ellen
Well, I would love that, Wendy.
Wendy
And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,
Stan frowns. Sad music plays.
Wendy
...and I've learned from it.
Her eyes begin to well up with tears.
Wendy
I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world.
Ms. Ellen
Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!
Cartman
That's not what we just heard!
The sidewalk. Mr. Garrison is next to a trash can. His shirt and pants are torn to bits. The top of Mr. Hat's hat is missing.
Mr. Garrison
Hoh Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job.
The women find him and rush towards him.
Woman
Oh my God, did he...?
Mr. Garrison
Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!!
He pants.
Mr. Garrison
We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again!
He enters Ton's Rhinoplasty again, the women rush by, and he peeks out from behind the window. So much for looking like David Hasselhoff...
The classroom.
Ms. Ellen
Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting.
A commotion is heard in the hall, then Arab soldiers burst through the door and pour into the classroom with their swords drawn.
Leader
Down! Down! Everybody down!
Cartman
What the hell...?
Everybody drops down below their desks.
Leader
So! We meet again, Ms. Ellen!
Principal Victoria
And just what is going on here, mister?
Leader
I am Hakeem Korashki, of the mighty nation of Iraq! This woman is a traitor to our government!
Ms. Ellen
It's a lie!
Korashki
She has killed thousands, and will kill again, I assure you!
Principal Victoria
Ms. Ellen, is this true?
Ms. Ellen
Nooo!
Korashki
We must take her back to Iraq immediately!
Wendy
Oh, coool!
Ms. Ellen
Principal Victoria, please.
Korashki
Here is a black-and-white photo of Ms. Ellen with our leader. [Shows photo.] Her real name is Makesh Alak Makarakesh.
Principal Victoria
Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!
Ms. Ellen
NOOOO!!
She grabs the scimitar away from a soldier.
Ms. Ellen
GET AWAY FROM ME!! UUGH!!
The scimitar leaves her hand and heads for Kenny. It pierces him right above the nose, picks him up, and pins him to the back wall.
Stan
Oh my God, she killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastard!
Ms. Ellen is being dragged out the door by the soldeirs.
Ms. Ellen
NOOOOOOO!!
Wendy
Wow.
The kids take their seats.
Wendy
What incredible irony.
School entrance. helicopters are hovering around, an ambulance and Officer Barbrady hold the crowd
back. Stan is standing next to Wendy.

Stan
Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
Wendy
Yeah, you just never know.
Stan
Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
Wendy
Happy Valentine's Day, Staan.
She turns to kiss him. He turns to kiss her. Wendy's theme plays. They get closer, then...
Stan
Bluuuuch!
Right in her mouth.
Wendy
Eeewwww!
Wendy quickly wipes the vomit from her mouth, Stan looks away, embarrased.
Stan
Sorry.
Wendy
No, it's okay, Stan!
Stan looks at her.
Wendy
Everything's going to be o-kay!
Kyle
Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
Cartman takes a big bite out of a cardboard box.
Cartman
Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
Iraqi desert. Military maneuvers are taking place. The camera stops at a rocket waiting to be launched.
Korashki
For crimes against this country, you are hereby sentenced to be shot into the center of the sun!
Ms. Ellen
Egh.
She is moved to the rocket.
Ms. Ellen
This is all a mistake!
She is thrown in the rocket.
Ms. Ellen
This can't be happening!
She pops up, the rocket door is shut, and the rocket is fired up.
Ms. Ellen
Pleease! For the love of God!
Korashki
Shove off!!
The rocket takes off and heads for the sun.
Wendy's house, pool party
Mrs. Campbell
Wo-hoo-hoo! Great party, Wendy!
Wendy
Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher.
Mrs. Campbell
Anything for you, sugar-pie!
Wendy sees Kyle come up.
Wendy
Oh, hi, Kyle!
Kyle
I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
Wendy
U-huh. Excuse me.
Some Iraqi soldiers approach to talk to Wendy.
Wendy
Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!
Iraqi
Ka fahra qetlaq humblaq! [Greetings...]
Wendy
Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq!
Iraqi
Kuhla shaluah lakhenblaturtulah!
Wendy
Kaqemblaq!
Wendy throws them a wad of bills.
Iraqi
Ah, laqeh blakatah!]
They walk away miffed.
Kyle
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
Wendy
Wait, wait!
She throws off her sunglasses and reaches down.
Wendy
It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe-box thing!
She puts it up to her left eye, then smiles. She is looking at the rocket fired off by the Iraqis some time earlier as it nears the sun. She sees the impact.
Wendy
Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen.
Kyle
Wendy! You didn't!
Wendy
I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!
Kyle is shocked.

Southwest Colorado, Site B. The kids are on a field trip
Anthropologist
...And so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust. We dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month.
Cartman
Boooriing.
The class laughs.
Mr. Garrison
Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep.
Under the morning edition of the ROCKY MTN. NEWS, with Mr. Hankey as the lead story.
Anthropologist
Now, can anybody tell me, who left these arrowheads here?
Stan
Isn't that your job?
Anthropologist
Well... yes, but I want to see if you're learning anything.
Stan
Oooh.
Anthropologist
Okay, I tell you what. Why don't we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own Indian arrowheads.
The class cheers, scatters, get some pickaxes and start picking away at the site.
Cartman
Day is never finished,
Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free...

Stan
Dude. Shut up, Cartman.
Pip
Oh! Oh I think I found one!
Reaching down for an arrowhead.
Cartman takes notice.
Cartman
No, I found it.
Pip
Oh. I do believe I found it first.
Cartman
No, I did, Pip.
Pip
Oh dear.
Cartman
Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it.
Pip
What do you mean?
Cartman
Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.
Pip
Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.
Cartman
Okay, ready? I'll go first.
Cartman back up, then runs at Pip, and kicks him in the nuts. Pip goes down in pain. The other kids laugh.
Pip
Well-uh I, I guess you win.
Cartman
Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it.
Tosses it back to Pip. The kids resume digging.
Cartman
Day is never finished,
Massa got me working...

Oh, look, I found another one.

He looks it over.
Cartman
Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle!
He tosses this one away, as well. It lands before Kyle.
Kyle
Whoa. Check it out, dude.
Kyle picks up the triangle.
Kyle
It's got little drawings on it.
Stan comes over to check it out.
Stan
What is it?
Kyle
I don't know.
The triangle flickers, then glows for a moment.
Stan
Whoa!
Kyle
That was cool!
Cartman rushes over.
Cartman
Eeyy! Give me that back!
Kyle
You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
Cartman
We'll ro-sham-bo for it!
Kyle
No way, fatty, it's mine!
Cartman
ANTHROPOLOGIST!
Anthropologist
[Strolling over.] How's it going, boys?
Cartman
I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
Kyle
You threw it away, fatso!
Anthropologist
Hm, let me see that. [Examines it.] Why, this is Anasazi writing! My God, this must be thousands of years old!
Cartman
[To Kyle.] Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it!
Kyle takes the triangle from the anthropologist and walks away.
News 4, Special Report.
Anchor
...and finally tonight, a young boy from South Park, Colorado found something very interesting during a field trip today. Here with a special report is a quadriplegic Swiss man on a pony.
Quadriplegic Swiss man
Thanks, Tom, the little eight year old was very shocked indeed when he came across a very ancient triangular object.
Kyle
Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
Cartman
...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
Kyle
[Off camera,] You liar, Cartman!
Cartman
Screw you, triangle thief!
Quadriplegic Swiss man
And so, the little boy will take his discovery home and perhaps donate it to science... mwell a little later. Back to you, Dave.
Dave
Thanks Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he's a little tubby.
Cartman pops up before the camera.
Cartman
Eeyy!
Kyle's house. The boys have returned from their trip.
Stan
What are you going to do with it, dude?
Kyle
I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
Cartman
Oh I'll find it, don't worry!
Kyle enters his room and closes the door. Cartman rushes up to it and jumps on the door knob.
Cartman
God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
Stan
You did throw it away, Cartman.
Cartman
I was just setting it aside.
Stan
Well, you might as well let it go.
Cartman
Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
School cafeteria. Chef is preparing a dish.
Chef
Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it...

Leonard Maltin
Excuse me, sir...
Chef
Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV.
Leonard Maltin
Leonard Maltin, yes.
Chef
Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.
Leonard Maltin
I know who you are. You must listen to me, Chef. We have precious little time. Have you seen Barbra Streisand recently?
Chef
Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?
Leonard Maltin
Have you seen her?!
Chef
No. Not since Yentl.
Leonard Maltin
Thank God. Then I'm not too late.
Chef
Too late for what?
Leonard Maltin
Chef, it is of the utmost importance that you tell me where those little boys from the news report on TV are.
Chef
Why do you care?
The bus stop. Stan and Kyle are working on a snowman as Cartman and Kenny watch.
Stan
I have a button we can use for his nose.
Kenny
(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)
Kyle
What would we use a marble sack for?
Cartman
Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
Kyle
I didn't steal anything.
Cartman looks away so as to not see Kyle.
Cartman
Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
Kyle
Good!
Kyle looks back as helicopter blades are heard.
Cartman
What's that noise?
A pink helicopter descends.
Kyle
Whoa!
Cartman
Aaah! Aliens!
Cartman covers his butt. The helicopter lands, the door opens, and Barbra Streisand appears.
Barbra Streisand
Who is the boy I saw on the news report tonight?
Stan and Kenny point at Kyle.
Barbra Streisand
Hello there, little boy. Do you know who I am?
Kyle
No.
Barbra Streisand
Ugh. I bet you do.}}
I'm going-

Kyle
Aagh! Stop that!
Barbra Streisand
-where there's lucky clovers in the f-

Stan
Ow, that sucks, dude!
Barbra Streisand
I'm Barbra Streisand!
Stan
...so?
Barbra Streisand
So?! Uh muh, so I'm a very famous and very important individual.
Stan
Like John Elway important?
Barbra Streisand
What?!
Stan
D'you know John Elway?
Barbra Streisand
No!
Stan
Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
Barbra Streisand
Ugh. Look. Little boy, I understand that you found a neat little triangle near here, you know what I'm talking about?
Kyle
Yyeeaahh.
Cartman
No! I found it, he stole it!
Kyle
You threw it away, Cartman!
Cartman
I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief.
Barbra Streisand
Well, little boy, does the triangle have a symbol of two snakes joined at the middle?
Kyle
Yeah. How'd you know?
Barbra Streisand
Okay, now this is very important. Where is the triangle of Zinthar now?
Kyle
Triangle of Zinthar?
Stan
Why do you wanta know, lady?!
Barbra Streisand
I'm not talking to you, you piss-ant little hick!
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Barbra Streisand
Where is the triangle, dammit?!
She picks up Kyle by the throat.
Kyle
AAAAAA!
Barbra drops Kyle as Officer Barbrady approaches.
Officer Barbrady
What seems to be the problemo here?
Barbra Streisand
Problemo? Huh, There's no problemo, Officer. I was just introducing myself to these charming little boys.
Cartman
Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!
Officer Barbrady
Boys, shouldn't you be in school?
Stan
It's Saturday.
Officer Barbrady
No excuses, move along, you little troublemakers!
The boys leave. Kyle lucked out.
Barbra faces Officer Barbrady.
Barbra Streisand
...Well?!
Officer Barbrady
Well what?
Barbra Streisand
You know who I am, don't you?
Officer Barbrady
Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass!
Barbra Streisand
Waaaaaaah!
She leaves in a huff.
Officer Barbrady
Hoh, what a bitch!
Kyle's house. Chef and Leonard Maltin are at the door
Chef rings the bell and knocks.
Chef
I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin.
Leonard Maltin
Damn! Then we must look for them elsewhere.
Chef
Come on, man. What is this all about?
Leonard Maltin
If Barbra Streisand saw the same report I did, then those boys are in grave danger. If you were Barbra Streisand, where would you be right now?
Chef
Hmmm.
A picture of Tom's Rhinoplasty pops into his head.
Leonard Maltin
Nono! I mean, where would she be staying?
Chef
Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.
Leonard Maltin
Where?
Chef
Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a rumor.
Leonard Maltin
Dammit man, where's your car?!
Barbra Streisand's four million dollar condo in the mountains.
Barbra Streisand
He has it, Milo. That little bastard has the triangle.
Milo
Are you sure?
Barbra Streisand
I'm sure! He knew about the symbol of Krewluck!
Milo
Then why don't we go get it?
Barbra Streisand
A cop showed up - he's a clever one - I can't blow everything now that I'm this close. Everything must be handled very carefully.
She goes to some bookshelves and pulls on a book, on the top of which is a secret button. She presses the button and the shelf rotates to reveal a pedestal with two holders. One triangle is already in one holder, the other one is still alone.
Barbra Streisand
How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand!
She laughs rather hysterically.
Kyle's bedroom. He's asleep. A model of the solar system, a picture of him and his elephant, and the Triangle of Zinthar can be seen on his dresser. The camera pans up to see a saw cutting through the ceiling. The hole is made and the cut piece is pushed unto the floor. Kyle flinches and turns around, now facing the wall. A rope comes down and footfalls are heard. Kyle adjusts himself. A pair of eyes looks around and sees the triangle, then Kyle, then back to the triangle. The eyes approach and two hands reach out to grab the triangle.
Ike
Cokeshen.
Cartman is distracted, knocking down the picture, waking up Kyle.
Kyle
Cartman?
Cartman
[Revealing himself.] You scared the crap out of me, Ike!
Kyle
What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman
I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?
Ike
Rear trohtru badt.
Kyle
Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
Ike
Cookeh monter.
Cartman
Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddamn son of a bitch!!
Ike
Ahtoahtahneurah.
Kyle gets out of bed.
Kyle
Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
Cartman
Huh?!
Kyle
If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!
Kyle hands him the triangle.
Kyle
There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
Cartman looks at the triangle.
Cartman
Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.
I got the triangle,
I got the triangle,
dee dun dee dun

He backs up and goes out the door. Kyle goes back to sleep. Meanwhile, in Chef's Town and Country, He and Maltin are driving around.
Leonard Maltin
Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here?
Chef
It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.
Leonard Maltin
Then we've got to keep looking.
Chef
[Braking hard.] Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!
Leonard Maltin
Haven't you ever been curious about the insanity Barbra Streisand exhibits?
Chef
Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.
Leonard Maltin
More than a bitch! She's a calculating, self-centered egotistical bitch! She was born in a small town, her mother was a jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman.
Chef
Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?
Leonard Maltin
When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer, but by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the universe. She learned of an ancient diamond, the Diamond of Pantheos.
Chef
Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!
Starts up the station wagon.
Chef
Forget I asked!
Leonard Maltin
Before she was seven the keepers of Pantheos learned of this insane little girl's wish. The diamond was split up, and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbra Streisand found one of the triangles.
Chef
And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
Leonard Maltin
Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets a hold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand!
Chef
Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.
The bus stop, Monday.
Stan
Man, the bus sure is late.
Cartman
Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.
Kyle
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
Barbra Streisand pulls up in her car wearing a Groucho Marx face mask, and steps out.
Barbra Streisand
Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today?
Stan
Fine.
Barbra Streisand
That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person.
The four boys stand silent.
Barbra Streisand
I hear that one of you found my triangle.
Kyle
Your triangle?
Barbra Streisand
Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours.
Cartman
Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!
Barbra Streisand
But I'll die.
Cartman
Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...
Barbra Streisand
I want to give you a big cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me.
Cartman
It is?
Stan
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
Barbra Streisand
Oooh, hahahah. Who is that?
Kyle
Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45.
The boys laugh and Barbra seethes.
Stan
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on.
The boys laugh again and Barbra gets angrier.
Cartman
Yeeh, stealth bombers.
The boys laughs some more.
CartmanYeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-
Dialog
Barbra Streisand
ENOUGH!!
The boys are suddenly horrified.
Barbra Streisand
Oh, Haa-ha. Anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, I'll take you up to my condo where I'll kill you - I I mean-uh, uh give you - money - for the triangle.
Cartman
Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass!
Heads for the car.
Kyle
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strangers?
Cartman
No, not when money is involved, stupid!
The kids climb into her car and Barbra revs it up.
Fanfare. Hollywood, at Direct to Video Studios.
Director
And. Action!
Sidney Poitier
[To Sally Struthers.] Rebecca, I'm a man. A man like any other with dreams and emotions. And that's why I'll never put a foreign object up my ass.
Director
Cut, great, print that. Excellent work, Sid. Take five, guys, let's set up for the next shot.
Sidney heads for his dressing room, enters, and heads for the mirror.
A clam shell opens up revealing two tiny princesses.
Princesses
Hello.
Sidney Poitier
Huh?
Princesses
You must hurry! A young man has found the Triangle of Zinthar.
Sidney Poitier
Where?
Princesses
At a small piss-ant white-bread mountain town in Colorado called South Park.
Sidney Poitier
Excellent!
Back at Barbra's condo.
Barbra Streisand
Eh. Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will be mine, and I will be the biggest, most famous person ever!
Cartman is strapped to a rack, the others hang from chains.
Cartman
Ugh. Let me go! Seriously!
Stan
Yeah, let us go!
Barbra Streisand
You fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! I'll teach you to meddle with my triangle!
Pulls the lever next to her.
The ropes start to tighten on the rack.
Cartman
Eey! It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!
Kyle
Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fat-ass!
Cartman
Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh.
Barbra Streisand
Wheeere is the triangle of Zinthar?!
Cartman
I don't remember.
Kyle
Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!
Barbra Streisand
[Slowly.] Maybe this will help jar your memory...
Cartman
No! Don't!
She starts singing again and the kids scream with pain.
Cartman
AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!
Barbra Streisand
NOOOW do you remember?!
Cartman
WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!
Stan
Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
Barbra Streisand
Alright. You asked for it!
I'm gonna tell you now...

The boys resume their screaming.
Chef's Town and Country. Still looking...
Chef
Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.
Leonard Maltin
Well, looks like we'll have to go to plan B.
Chef
There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.
Leonard Maltin
Have you ever heard of the band called, The Cure?
Chef
Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!
Leonard Maltin
No, no. Just the lead singer. [He starts convulsing.] Oh! Ah!
Chef
Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?
Leonard Maltin
She's close! She's very close-I can feel her.
Chef
Where?
Leonard Maltin
Sh-She has the boys! The, they're in trouble!
Chef
Ooh, fudge!
Leonard Maltin
Keep going this way! Hurry!
They round a bend and disappear.
The condo.
Barbra Streisand
Happiness with you is like happiness...

The boys are still screaming.
Cartman
Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is, it's inside my shoe.
Milo approaches and removes Cartman's right shoe.
Kyle
Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
Cartman
I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!
Milo hands the triangle to Barbra.
Barbra Streisand
Finally, the triangle is mine! After centuries of waiting, I finally have the triangle of Zinthar! Now, the Diamond of Pantheos is complete.
Barbra joins the triangles and the resulting diamond begins to spin and glow.
Barbra Streisand
Sugoi! Kono ima... atarashii hajimari da! Ima kara... atashi no na mae wa... (Wow! This is... a new beginning! From now on... my name will be...)
A strobe flash goes off when the diamond reaches the height of its brilliance, and the pedestal the diamonds were on shines very brightly thereafter.
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Flashes of light continue to escape the diamond, and Barbra beings to transform.
Barbra Streisand
...Mecha... Barbura... Sutoraisando!
She grows as she transforms, breaking through the roof, then lets out a roar and leaves her condo as a giant mechanical lizard.
Stan
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
South Park. Mecha Streisand arrives.
Jimbo
Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!
Reporter
...and so, just weeks after the devastating attack of mutant genetic creatures, zombies, and Thanksgiving turkeys, the town of South Park has managed to rebuild itself, once again be-
Mecha Streisand appears behind him, holding a car, and lets out a roar as she devours it.
Reporter
Oh, Goddammit, not again!
She rips the roof off the new Sushi Bar.
Singer
Bar-bura, Bar-bura...
[she crushes the sushi bar with her foot]
...kirai no hito. (you are so hateful)
[She steps off the sushi bar. The Mayor is watching from her window across the street]
Bar-bura, Bar-bura...
[Mecha Streisand throws the roof away, then rips the roof off the building next to it, grabs two people, but drops one of them]
...anata no hi. (today is your day)
[The Mayor looks on, mortified. Her door opens]

Assistant
Mayor! Barbra Streisand is-
Mayor
I noticed! Call the National Guard!
Her assistant leaves as Mecha Streisand roars again.
Mayor
Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch.
Mecha Streisand grabs the building and shakes the people out of it.
Mayor
And to think I actually watched your HBO special.
The condo. Chef and Leonard Maltin arrive.
Chef
Children!
The boys
Chef!
Leonard Maltin notices the gaping hole in the ceiling.
Leonard Maltin
Oh no! No! She has joined the two triangles?
Cartman
Yes! She stole my triangle!
Stan
Get us down from here!
Chef tries to remove the chains from Stan's wrists.
Chef
I can't - break these - locks!
Leonard Maltin
Stand back, Chef!
Chef stands back as Leonard Maltin does a few martial arts moves.
Leonard Maltin
Marutam Re!
His eyes send out laser beams. He first frees Stan and Kyle, then Cartman and Kenny.
Kyle
Whoa, that was cool!
Leonard Maltin
I've got to go after Mecha Streisand! Chef, I need you to call Robert Smith of The Cure at this number!
Stan
Robert Smith? Sweet!
A studio. Robert Smith picks up the phone.
Robert Smith
Hello?
Chef
Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?
Robert Smith
Yes i' is.
Chef
This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.
Robert Smith
Ooooooh so Barbra Streisand's found the other triangle, eh?
Chef is stunned.
South Park. Looks pretty devastated. The National Guard is pulling in.
Sergeant
All right, men, give 'er everything you've got!
Mecha Streisand roars down at them, and they fire rockets at her from all around, to no effect. Helicopters surround her and fire away. Jimbo and Ned are in one of them, with Ned piloting.
Jimbo
Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here.
Ned circles around to her face.
Ned
Okay. Aah! aah! I'm scaared!
Jimbo fires a shoulder rocket, but it just bounces off her shoulder. She rears back and swats Their helicopter out of the sky. The other helicopters scatter.
Singer
Bar-bura, Bar-bura, ugoina chichi da.
(Barbra, Barbra, those tits are wonderful)

Sergeant
[To his commander.] It's no use! Our firepower has no effect!
Sheila
Oh my God, it is you! Oh, I an such a huge fan, Ms. Streisand. I never thought I'd live to see you in person!
Mecha Streisand roars back.
Sheila
I hate to ask this, but could I get an autograph? My sister would die.
Mecha Streisand roars assent and stoops to sign the autograph book.
Sheila
Oh thank you, Ms. Streisand!
Mecha Streisand roars in triumph and rounds a corner. Everybody runs.
Citizen
Oh my Goooodd! [Amid screams.]
Mr. Garrison
We're doomed! Good-bye, Mr. Hat.
Singer
Bar-bura, Bar-bura!

She stops before Leonard Maltin.
Leonard Maltin
Barbra!
She steps back surprised, then roars.
Leonard Maltin
Kitte, Kitte. Churipu. (Come, come. Tulip!)
Leonard Maltin begins to transform.
Singer
Ultura Lenardu Marutin!

Lenardu Marutin shows off some moves. Mecha Streisand respnds by kicking away the ushi bar. Chef and the boys arrive just after that. Lenardu Marutin grabs the building next to the bar and hits her with it, causing her to fall back.
Chef
Look out, children!
Townspeople run by, then the boys scream and scatter. Jimbo's Guns lands where they were standing. Mecha Streisand kicks Lenardu Marutin in the groin and he lands on his back, but Chef and the boys have to scatter again before he does. Stan and Kyle regroup and look at the scene, but Kyle turns around for some reason. Kenny is seen running towards a tetherball. He hits it with his left hand. It swings around and swoops him up.
Kenny
(Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!)
Kenny dies strangled by the tether-ball.
Kenny
(Ugh!)
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastard!
Sidney Poitier flies in like Superman and lands next to Chef.
Sidney Poitier
What's going on here?
Chef
Sidney Poitier?
Sidney Poitier
That's right. I'm Sidney Poitier.
Chef
Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!
Sidney Poitier
Barbra Streisand has found the triangle of Zinthar?
Chef
Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
Sidney Poitier
Kolooh kulatchki!
Sidney Poitier begins transforming.
Singer
Megara Poatia,
Megara Poatia,
sokuroi da ne.
(Megara Poatia Megara Poatia. Look, how black you are.)
[Megara Poatia takes off and spins towards Mecha Streisand.]
Megara Poatia, Megara Poatia-

Chef
[Annoyed.] Is that really necessary?
Mecha Streisand fends off Lenardu Marutin, then picks up Megara Poatia and twirls him around in an airplane move and throws him onto a mountain. He bounces over the top and away. The boys are shocked. Lenardu Marutin fixes his gaze on her, but she blocks it with her right hand. She then breathes a plasma blast at him, which lands hard and knocks him onto his back.
Chef
It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.
Cartman
Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her!
Cartman covers his eyes.
Stan
My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
Chef
We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
Woman
Oh my Goooood, help meeee!
Mecha Streisand is tearing up the town, ripping apart some buildings, stomping on others...
Robert Smith
Am I too late?
Chef
[Irritated.] Who are you?
Stan
Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
Cartman
Sweet!
Robert Smith
Here, you boys hold this walkie, you can help me fight her.
Chef
You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier.
Robert Smith
I have to try. I can't let Barbra Streisand do this to the entire world.
Robert Smith begins transformation into a giant moth.
Singer
Rabartu Smitu,
Rabartu Smitu,
tashiwa daisuki Rabartu Smitu.
(Robert Smith, Robert Smith, I like you a lot, Robert Smith)

Mecha Streisand heads for a gas station with a dinosaur for its symbol, but Rabartu Smitu comes up fast behind her. She notices. He shrieks at her, she covers her ears, and skyscrapers all around lose their windows. She responds with her own shrieks, and he covers his ears. More skyscrapers lose their windows.
Leonard Maltin
[Back to normal.] We must tell him that her weak point is the nose.
Stan
[Into the walkie.] Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
Rabartu Smitu looks at him and acknowledges the command by lefting the right-hand index and pinky fingers. Mecha Streisand tears apart some power lines and prepares to electrocute him, but he launches his fist. It hits her square on the nose and a diamond falls out, which lands in fron of Kyle.
Kyle
The Diamond of Pantheos. [Looks at Stan.] She must be powerless now.
Stan
[Into the walkie.] Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!
Singer
Rabartu Smitu,
Rabartu Smitu!

Chef looks at him more annoyed than before. Rabartu Smitu maneuvers Mecha Streisand around and grabs her by the tail. After some airplane spins he launches her into outer space. An electrical overload occurs and she blows up into millions of pieces. The fireworks can be seen from the town and the townspeople cheer up and down.
Stan
He did it!
Kyle
No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!
Stan
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
Jesus
Our Savior!
Robert Smith transforms back to normal.
Robert Smith
Can I have my walkie-talkie back now, please?
Cartman
No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!
Robert Smith
Alright, I'll ro-sham-bo you for it. Ready?
Cartman
Huh?
Cartman gets a kick in the groin and falls. Robert Smith moves aside.
Cartman
Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah!
Robert Smith walks towards the sunset as Japanese music plays, apparently without the walkie-talkie.
Chef
Hey! Where's he goin'?
Stan
Good-bye, Robert Smith!
Cartman
Thanks for your help! Visit us again!
Kyle
Disintegration is the best album everrr!
Kyle's house.
Stan
Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
Kyle
We've got to get rid of them.
Kyle heads for a small trash can next to the coffee table.
Kyle
Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted!
He tosses the triangles in.
Stan
Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
Cartman reaches over.
Cartman
No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!
Kyle
Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?!
Stan turns left and walks to the door.
Cartman
Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll ro-sham-bo you for it!
Ike, seeing what Kyle had thrown in, reaches the trash can and jumps in.
Stan
Go to hell, Cartman!
In front of the house.
Kyle
Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
Stan
Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
Kyle
But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
Stan
Yeah.
Cartman
Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!
The steps of a giant are heard and the kids grow fearful] Oh no! She's back!
Stan
Oh my God! Look!
The camera reveals a giant Ike coming out from behind the house.
All three
AAAAA! MECHA IKE!

Stan
Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
Kyle
Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
Kenny
(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed.)
The three laugh.
Kyle
Yeah.
Stan
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
The bus pulls up.
Ms. Crabtree
Come on, we're running late!
Stan
We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
Ms. Crabtree
What did you say?!
Stan
I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
Ms. Crabtree
Oh. Alright, then.
She closes the door and drives away.
Kyle
Whoa, dude.
Stan
I always wondered if that would work.
The boys approach Cartman's house. Kyle rings the bell.
Liane
Hello, boys.
Kyle
Hi. We were wondering why fat-ass Mitt to mouth.] I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
Liane
Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.
Stan
In the backyard?
In the backyard. A classical piece plays as the camera looks at the picnic table left over from Cartman's birthday. Cartman is at table surrounded by four dolls: he is hosting a tea party. Think Mr. Hat, then the Mad Hatter...
Cartman
Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?
Polly
Yes, Eric, I would like some tea. Thank you.
Cartman
You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.
The boys pop up over some bushes and look at Cartman from a distance.
Cartman
Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?
Clyde
Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?
Cartman
Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.
Polly
You are so strong and smart, Eric. Everybody likes you.
Cartman
Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. [Sips.]
Stan
[Behind the bushes with the others.] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Kenny
(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea.)
Kyle
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
Stan
No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
Kyle
Really?
Peter
[Back at table.] We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea.
Cartman
Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.
Polly
Eric is the best!
Clyde
Hooray for Eric!
Peter
Eric kicks ass!
At school, the Counselor's office. The boy who saw the counselor in December is back, but then, so is Kyle.
Kyle
Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, well, there's a news flash!
Stan
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
Kyle
Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
Mr. Mackey
Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay?
Kyle
Woo-whataya mean?
Mr. Mackey
Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?
Stan
No.
Mr. Mackey
Well-obviously something is bothering him. [looks left] Oh, of course!
Mr. Mackey walks over to a shelf.
Mr. Mackey
My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay?
Stan
Is that legal?
Mr. Mackey
Oh, hell yes!
Back at Cartman's Tea Party.
Cartman
My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.
Polly
Oh, thank you, Eric. You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and true.
Peter
Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much.
Cartman
That's niiice, Peter Panda.
Stan and Kyle are back at the bushes with Mr. Mackey's camera.
Stan
Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
Kyle
How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
Stan
I donnow, just keep rolling.
Cartman
More tea, Rumpertumskin?
Rumpertumskin
Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome.
Cartman
Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?
Clyde
I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
Cartman, confused of how to take that.
Cartman
Eeeyy!
Cartman's house, later that night. Cartman and his mom are dining when Mr. Kitty comes by.
Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!
Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!
Kitty
Hhhhhcck!
Liane
How is your beefy roast, snookums?
Cartman
Mom? Can I ask you a question?
Liane
Sure, hon.
Cartman
You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?
Liane
Uh huuuh.
Cartman
And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?
Liane
Yyeess??
They look at each other for a long time.
Liane
Well, what's your question, hon?
Cartman
God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
Liane
Oooooohh.
Cartman
I want to know where I came from.
Liane
Ooohh, hhmmm [Finger to lips.]. Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other.
Cartman
Uh huuh.
Liane
And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha.
Cartman and his mom look at each other, Kitty looks at them both.
Cartman
So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
Liane
Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance.
A flashback sequence begins where a barn appears with a banner: 12th Annual Drunken Barn Dance. Cows are standing around while music and light emanate from inside the barn.
Liane
I was young and naive then...
Liane is seen downing a very tall flask of beer.
Man
Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman.
Liane
Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he. [The band ends its tune.] I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! [She stands next to Barbrady.]
Trainee Barbrady
I wouldn't mind gettin' ahold of your cookies, Ms. Cartman!
Liane
[Breathlessly.] Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady.
Trainee Barbrady
[Takes a cookie and bites into it.] Mm, that's a good cookie! [The band resumes playing.]
Jimbo
Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance!
A duck falls from the ceiling and everybody takes their bottles of beer and toast the occasion. They drop their empty bottles, and Ned ends up falling where he stands.
Liane
And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.
The crowd separates to reveal a handsome Indian entering the dance. A song begins.
Singing
There you are, like a throbbing star. I want you to make love to me.

Ms. Cartman and the Chief focus in on each other, then walk to each other, then bump into each other. Ms. Cartman falls, then gets up, vomits, and starts dancing with the Chief.
Liane
I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.
Cartman
So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?
Liane
Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
Cartman
[Weighs the story.] That isn't a very romantic story, Mom.
Liane
I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
Cartman
Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.
Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!
Stan's house. Grandpa, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are watching TV.
Annoncer
Coming this Sunday, [Music begins to play.] a major television event that will blow you away. Terrance. Phillip.
The title screen appears.
Announcer
In the harrowing made-for-TV drama, Not Without My Anus, based on a true story.
Terrance
Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter.
Phillip
Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance.
He farts. They both laugh, the music starts up again.
Annoncer
See Canada's hottest stars on the HBC movie of the week.
Stan
Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
Kyle
Yeah, dude. It looks riveting.
Grandpa starts flipping channels.
Stan
Come on Grandpa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
Grandpa
No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show.
Stan
Aaawww.
Kyle
[At the same time.] Hunh?
Annoncer
And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos. Here is you host, Bob Saget!
Bob Saget
Hey, I just flew into the studio.
He flaps his right arm like he actually flew in.
Bob Saget
Boy are my arms tired. Heheh. Heh.
Grandpa laughs, but no one in the studio audience is.
Bob Saget
Wha, Why didn't the skeleton cross the road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts.
Only he and Grandpa laugh.
Bob Saget
Knock knock.
The audience stays silent.
Bob Saget
Bob.
Audience is silent.
Bob Saget
Bob Saget..
He chuckles to himself. As if on cue, the audience breaks into laughter and some members fall over. Grandpa falls over, too, and laughs his ass off for a minute or so.
Stan
This guy sucks!
The bell rings and he goes to answer it.
Kyle
Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
Stan opens the door to find Cartman
Stan
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
Cartman
[Indian music plays.] Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people.
He's dressed in Indian clothes (including tassels), with a headband holding three feathers, and an eagle necklace, not a bear one.
Stan
What??
Kyle and Kenny reach the door, look at Cartman, and crack up.
Cartman
Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!
The boys are quiet.
Cartman
Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.
Stan
What are you talking about, Cartman?!
Cartman
My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?
Stan
Go ahead, dude.
Cartman turns left and leaves to get the bike. The other three return to the sofa to watch TV.
Kyle
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
Stan
Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
Bob Saget
Just a free li'l reminder to all of you out there: send us your stupidest home videos. Grand prize for this month will be $10,000. [Chuckles.]
Grandpa
Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.
Kyle
Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video.
They realize that they do, then look at the videotape, and smile.
UTE Native American Reservation.
Chief Running Water
...And Bear cried to Eagle-
Indian 1
Running Water, there is some kid here to see you.
Chief Running Water
What kid?
Indian 1
He claims to be your kid.
Cartman squeezes his way into the campfire circle.
Cartman
Hiya, Dad!
Chief Running Water
Who the hell are you?
Cartman
I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Chief Running Water
Your mother?
Cartman
Liane Cartman.
Chief Running Water
Cartman? Hohoho. Oh boy, I was worried there for a second. [Suddenly serious.] Look, kid, I'm not your father.
Cartman
But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
Chief Running Water
Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'
Cartman
Whatooya mean?
Chief Running Water
She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'
Cartman
Huh??
Chief Running Water
Your mom's a slut.
The other Utes on either side of him nod in agreement.
Cartman
Eeyy!!
Chief Running Water
Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you.
He flashes back to the 12th Annual Drunken Barn Dance.
Chief Running Water
We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot.
Chief Running Water
There you are...
Chief Running Water
I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things.
Liane
Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.
Chief Running Water
Whoa, Helloooh!!
They start kissing. A man vomits and passes out.
Liane
[Interrupting the action.] Wait. Wait.
She looks towards the entrance, and the Chief rolls back.
Liane
] Who is that?
Some funk plays as Chef makes his entrance and waves hello to everyone. She looks at Chef.
Singing
There you are like a throbbing star-

Now these two focus in on each other.
Liane
Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
Chief Running Water
Huh??
Liane gets up and leaves.
Chief Running Water
You gotta be kidding me.
Liane
[Approaching Chef.] Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. [Flirts with him gently.]
Chef
Nawh. I'm new in town.
Liane
Well, what's a nice, handsome, black [She looks at his crotch. He follows her gaze.] man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?
Chef
I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
Liane
Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?
Chef
Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?
Liane
Ahah, I'm plastered! [Tongues come out and they start kissing.]
Cartman
[Alone with the Chief] His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??
Chief Running Water
He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.
Cartman
Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
Back in town, the following day. Kenny is trying to start a go-cart.
Stan
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
Kyle
Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
Stan
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
Kyle
If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
Stan
[With the right hand cupped to the side of his mouth.] Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
Cartman
[With rap beats playing now.] 'S up, homies?
He's dressed in a red jogging suit and white sneakers. He has a large clock hanging off his necklace and sports a high flat-top. On his right hand are some brass knuckles with the work 'PIE' grafted to them.
Stan
Cartman?!
Cartman
I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
Kyle
You live on the Eastside, Cartman!
Stan
Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
Cartman
[Aloofly.] Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.
Stan and Kyle just look at him.
Cartman
You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
He starts to moonwalk away to the sound of scratchin'.
Stan
Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
Kenny finally gets the go-cart going, but is yanked behind it. It won't let him go, and a variation on Mission Impossible begins to play.
Kenny
(Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)
Stan, Kyle
Hold on, Kenny!
Kenny
(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-
He hits a bump on the road.
Kenny
(AARGH.)
The go-cart returns and goes into the snow.
Kenny
(Goddamn, why-)
He goes into a tight grove of trees, then exits.
Kenny
(Oh this freakin'-)
He hits a boulder.
Kenny
(AARGH.)
The go-cart lands upside down on some tracks. Kenny gets up and dusts himself off.
Kenny
(Phew.)
The guys look at him and he waves to them.
Kenny
(Well, I'm fine, guys!)
They smile and wave back.
Kenny
(Now if I can-)
A train strike him and the go-cart, obliterating both.
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
Kyle
You bastards!
Chef's house. Cartman arrives.
Chef
Hello?
Cartman
Yo, Pops!
Chef
[Studying...] Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?
Cartman
You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?
Chef
Get in here! [Drags him in.]
Cartman
Westsa-eed-eh.
Now in the living room with Cartman.
Chef
Take that wig off! [Does it himself.] What's gotten into you?!
Cartman
You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Chef
What?! Noh! Uh, did I?
Cartman
He said you kissed her with your tongue.
Chef
Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
Cartman
[Dejected.] Huho. So you're not my dad?
Chef
Of course not. Here. You children sit down,
Chef props him up on a stool.
Chef
...and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen,
and the two take off their clothes,
that's right,
And they caress and touch each other,
until the part of the man grows,
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot,
And the man says "I love you" and the woman says "hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom"
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait...
[Pause.]
...and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says,
"Baby, I'm gettin' hot!"
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...

Cartman
What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
Chef
Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember.
Back at the Drunken Barn Dance. Chef is kissing Liane on the hay stack.
Liane
Whoa, Chef! [He pulls away a bit.] You're so strong!
Jimbo
Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos!
The barn door opens and the Broncos pour in. Most of them are "hutt-hutting".
Bronco 1
Are we late for the party?
Bronco 2
What the hell town is this?
Singing
There you are, like a throbbing star. I want-

Liane
Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!
Chef
Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!
Liane
Woooh! Whooppee!! [She throws her arms out in ecstasy.] Unhh!
A hand appears from under the hay. Chef grabs it and pulls the rest of the body up.
Chef
Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
Mr. Garrison
You're drunk, Mr. Hat!
Mr. Garrison is rather pleased that he did quite a bit without getting caught. Liane now looks at Mr. Garrison.
Singing
There you are-

Chef
Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!
Liane
Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a menage o'three?
Chef
Yeah! When two women are involved. [Moves away.]
Mr. Garrison
Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman.
He moves quickly on top of her and starts kissing her.
Chef
And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
Cartman
No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!
Stan's house that afternoon. He, Kyle, and Grandpa are once again looking at TV
Announcer
And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-
Bob Saget
Here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.
Cartman
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
The audience is watching.
Polly
I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all.
The audience starts to laugh.
Cartman
Really? You don't think so?
Clyde
Naw, you're not fat.
Cartman
[Grabs a teacup.] Gee, that's kewl.
The audience is laughing harder. Stan and Kyle are laughing with the audience, and Stan's parents appear.
Sharon
Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning.
Stan
Huh? [Looks up at them.] Oh yeah.
Randy
Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?
Stan
How 'bout some ice cream?
Kyle
Yeah, with butterscotch.
Stan nods in agreement.
Sharon
You bet, you poor dears.
Bob Saget
Now, the moment you've all been waiting for, when one of our lucky videos qualifies for the $10,000 Grand Prize to be chosen tomorrow night! The winner is [Drumroll crescendo.] Little Boy's Tea Party.
Kyle
Woohoo!
Stan
Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
Kyle
We're gonna win $10,000! [Grandpa doesn't look pleased...]
Stan
Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! [Kyle dances gleefully.]
The Bar. Mr. McCormick and Mr. Garrison are at the bar.
Mr. Garrison
Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem! [To the barkeep.] Another Cosmo, please.
Cartman barges in throwing the bar doors open.
Cartman
All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!
Mr. Garrison
What the hell are you talking about, Eric?
Cartman
It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
Mr. Garrison
[Gasps.] Oh.
Jimbo
Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay.
Mr. Garrison
I am not gay!
Cartman
Then you did sleep with my mom?
Mr. Garrison
No!
Jimbo
He's gay!!
Mr. Garrison
Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!
Everything stops and gasps are heard.
Mr. Garrison
Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman?
Two men at a table look around and get shocked. Principal Victoria and Mayor McDaniels are seen next.
Principal Victoria
Oooooh.
Mayor McDaniels
[At the same time] Hmmm.
Jesus and Father Maxi look shocked as well. No one moves.
Grizzled Man
I haven't.
Mr. Garrison
...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!
Halfy
Oh. Yeah.
Mr. Garrison
So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know.
Cartman slumps and Jimbo takes pity on him.
Jimbo
[Approaching him.] Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean.
A dirge plays as Cartman heads out of the bar. Jimbo and Mr. Garrison look on, as do Jesus and Father Maxi.
Mephesto
Wait, wait. [Cartman stops.] I know a way to find out.
He is at the bar with his little friend, Kevin.
Cartman
[Turns around.] How?
Mephesto
At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is.
Cartman
Really? You can? [The dirge turns hopeful.]
Mephesto
Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but...
Cartman
How much?
Mephesto
Three thousand should cover it.
Cartman
I don't have $3000.
Mephesto
Oh. Never mind.
The bus stop, next day. Stan and Kyle are waiting.
Stan
Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
Kyle
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
Cartman
[Depressed.] Hi guys.
Stan
How's it going, Cartman?
Cartman
Oh, fine. How are you guys?
Kyle looks at Stan, both are worried.
Kyle
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
Cartman
Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.
Stan
Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?
Cartman
Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.
Stan
Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
Cartman
Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...
Stan and Kyle look at each other again, seeing who'll make a move first.
Cartman
Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.
Kyle
Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
Cartman
[Suddenly bright.] You do?
Stan
Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
Cartman
You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!
Stan
Uh, yyeah.
Cartman's house that night. The boys are on the sofa.
Announcer
And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-
Cartman
What kind of video did you guys make?
Stan
Uuh, you'll see.
Bob Saget
Well, it's time to crown the $10,000 winner. Our judges have narrowed it down to only three videos-first it's... "Dog Who Puts Hat On Master's Head."
Falsetto Bob Saget
Oh, I'm a little dog. I'm just a little dog. [The dog picks up a hat and walks towards a man on a chair.] Hahaha. [Leaps up behind the man and drops the hat in place.] Hold on, I've got to put a hat on my master's head, [Jumps off, and the man turns to see the camera.] hehehahahuh.
The audience laughs. One woman with red curly hair is particularly tickled by the video.
Bob Saget
And now our second finalist, "Little Boy Has A Tea Party."
Cartman reacts to what he sees on screen, which is a video of his tea party two days before.
Cartman
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
Polly
Oh, thank you, Eric.
The audience starts to laugh. Cartman is shocked, and Kyle, seeing Cartman's reaction, is afraid.
Bob Saget
Boy! Looks like this kid needs some therapy! Heheheheheh, heheheh.
Stan
We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money!
Cartman's anger is beginning to build.
Cartman
I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.
Kyle
[Trying some encouragement] They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!
Stan smiles, Kyle throws his arms up.
Kyle
We're gonna win!.
Bob Saget
And finally our third contestant, "Young Child Gets Hit By A Train."
Falsetto Bob Saget
Oh, I'm such a cute little kid.
It is the scene where Kenny gets killed. Stan and Kyle are shocked, Cartman is angrier.
Falsetto Bob Saget
Hmmm, I wonder if I can get this go-cart started.]
The go-cart starts and pulls Kenny along 'round a corner, back again, into some tree, and finally onto the railroad tracks.
Falsetto Bob Saget
Oh! I hope I don't get hit by a train.
The train demolishes him.
Falsetto Bob Saget
Ooooh, I sure did.
Stan and Kyle are agape, and the audience roars with laughter.
Stan
Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Bob Saget
Now, that's what I call a joyride. Heeheeheeh.
The audience continues laughing.
Bob Saget
And the winner is, naturally, "Little Boy Being Hit By A Train,"
Stan is stunned, Kyle is cross.
Bob Saget
Nnnnhnnnhnnnh.
The audience laughs harder.
Stan
Dude. We lost.
Kyle
Dammit!
Cartman
[Slowly, deliberately.] I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously.
Getting more livid with every word.
Bob Saget
Stand up and take a bow, Mr. Marsh.
Grandpa
I won! I won!
Stan's eyes grow large.
Stan
Grandpa!!
Bob Saget
Our other finalists will have to settle for their $3000 runner-up prizes-well, see you next time.
He chuckles as the show ends.
Kyle
Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
Cartman is very livid now.
Cartman
Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!
South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. Thunder and lightning abound.
Mephesto
All right. From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef [Blinks up.], Jimbo [A bit shocked.], Mr. Garrison [Eyebrows up.], Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski [Surprised.], myself, my friend Kevin [Looks up at him.], or, the 1989 Denver Broncos.
Stan
Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
Mephesto
The test results are in this envelope.
Cartman is hopeful.
Mephesto
Shall I... open it?
Mr. Garrison
[Impatiently.] Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!
Mephesto
Erhum ehrum uh [Gasps.] The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-
Announcer
[An organ plays.] Who is Eric Cartman's father? Is it - Chief Running Water? [Looks askance.] Or is it - Chef? Is it Mephesto? [Looks around.] Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? Or is it Mr. Garrison?
Jimbo
Nope. He's gay.
Mr. Garrison
You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Announcer
Is it Jimbo?
Jimbo
[Aghast.] Daaagh!
Announcer
Or is Officer Barbrady?
Officer Barbrady
Huh?! Where?!
Announcer
Or could it be Ned?
Ned
Could be.
Announcer
Or Mr. Broflovski??
Kyle
[Pissed.] Dad, how could you?!
Announcer
Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? The answer is coming on an all-new South Park, in just four weeks.
Cartman
[Record scratches.] What?! [Enunciating] Son of a bitch!

	South Park.
Announcer 1
Since the last South Park, you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of Eric Cartman is. Now, finally, the shocking truth about Cartman's lineage... will not be seen tonight, so that we can bring you the following special presentation.
SPECIAL PRESENTATION
APRIL FOOLS
[A kazoo is heard.]'
Announcer 2
[Theme music plays.] Now, get ready for Canada's hottest action stars,
Terrance and Phillip appear in turn.
Announcer 2
Terrance and Phillip in HBC's Movie of the Week:
The title comes into view and a heavy bass thump is heard.
Announcer 2
Not Without My Anus. Based on a true story.
Canadian Courthouse 10:18 A.M. Dramatic music plays as the camera zooms in on the courthouse.
Scott the Dick
Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer.
He demonstrates this
Scott
That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!
Suspenseful notes play. Terrance farts and both he and Phillip laugh about it.
Phillip
Oh, Terrance, You farted in court.
Terrance
Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. [They laugh again.]
Scott
[Approaching the displays.] All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,
A hole is seen on the left shoulder of Terrance's shirt. He quickly puts his right hand over it and looks around nervously.
Scott
a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.
"Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in
with my new hammer."
Terrance is aghast at the mountain of evidence against him..
Scott
Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God. J'accuse, Terrance.
Terrance
Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?
Phillip
Yes, please.
Terrance farts and has the jury laughing.
Terrance
That's called the monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys.
Phillip
The monkey claw is smelly.
Judge
[Bangs his gavels twice.] Come on, get a move on. I ain't gettin' any younger up here.
Phillip
My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian.
Judge
That is correct.
Phillip
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. [Farts.]
Terrance
Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument.
Phillip
I have, haven't I, Terrance?
He farts again. The jurors and Terrance laugh.
Scott
Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court. They think that farts are funny, but they're not. [Thumps the table.]
Judge
[Gavels] Sustained.
Phillip
Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?
Shows a picture of Terrance feeding a llama. The jury is silent.
Phillip
Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you.
The jury gasps softly. Terrance and Phillip laugh.
Phillip
Just kidding.
Terrance is laughing so hard he thumps the table twice.
Phillip
The defense rests.
Phillip returns to his table, farting on Scott on the way over. The jurors and audience laugh.
Scott
Goddammit. That isn't funny.
Judge
Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get the hell outta here?!
Madame Foreperson
We have, Your Honor. We have found Terrance, in the above entitled action of murder against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer--
Terrance farts, then laughs. Phillip joins in.
Judge
You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we have some flatulence issues.
Madame Foreperson
I said, we find--
Terrance farts.
Madame Foreperson
We find Terrance--
Terrance and Phillip fart.
Madame Foreperson
Not guilty!
Phillip
Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty.
Terrance
Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber.
They look at each other for a moment, and laugh.
Outside the courthouse. Terrance and Phillip descend the steps, which are lined with news crews ready to interrogate anyone who wants to talk.
Terrance
That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kroff Dinner.
Phillip
Hear hear.
Scott
[Coming over.] Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!
Phillip
Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?
Scott
There are hard feelings! This isn't over. I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done. And do you know why?
Phillip
'Cause you're a dick?
Scott
No, Because I hate you. You think farting is so funny. Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--
Phillip farts; he and Terrance laugh.
Scott
Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer.
The laughter stops quick.
Phillip
Cancer?
Scott
Yes. In the head.
Terrance
Head cancer?
Scott
This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day. [Leaves.]
Terrance
Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip.
Phillip
Yes, perhaps he's homophobic.
Terrance
[Wondering.] But we're not gay, Phillip.
Phillip
We're not? [The news crews leave.]
Terrance
Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kroff Dinner.
Phillip
Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kroff Dinner can calm my nerves.
On the subway, Terrance and Phillip are alone. Phillip farts, and they both laugh.
Terrance
Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week.
Phillip
He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
Terrance
God only knows.
Phillip
The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance.
Terrance
It sure is. Let's look for treasure.
Phillip
Yes, let's look for treasure.
This is a luxurious subway. There are compartments between the seats into which one may put belongings and such. Terrance opens the compartment to his left, and Phillip the one to his right. Phillip then opens the one to his left and they both look in.
Scott's House 11:57 A.M. The phone rings and Scott answers.
Scott
Hello?
Voice
Hello, Is this Scott, from Canada?
Scott
Yess, yes it is.
Voice
You're a Journalist, right?
Scott
Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
Voice
I understand that you hate Terrance and Phillip.
The voice is in a dark room, seated in a high-backed chair, turned away from the camera.
Scott
Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!
Voice
Well, what about I help you get rid of them once and for all?
Scott
Who is this?
Voice
Let's just say that I'm someone who can help you, if you help me.
The chair swivels 'round and a familiar face appears...
Voice
Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein.
Scott
[Surprised.] Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi dictator?
A Republican Guard stands at either side of Saddam.
Saddam Hussein
Eey, relax guy. I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest.
Scott
What do you want?
Saddam
You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super!.Let's get started.
Scott
I'm not sure I should trust you.
Saddam
Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me!
Saddam grins. Scott looks uncertain.
Terrance and Phillip reach home.
Terrance
Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
Someone approaches.
Phillip
Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob.
Ugly Bob
Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip.
Terrance
My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
Ugly Bob
How can you guys say stuff like that?
Terrance
Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob.
Ugly Bob
I know, but--
Phillip
Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver.
Ugly Bob
I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside.
Terrance
No it isn't. [They laugh.] Wanna see what's on the inside of me?
Terrance farts. They laugh about it. Bob is unfazed.
Phillip
Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?
Terrance
Yes.
Phillip slips the bag over Bob's head.
Terrance
If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.
Ugly Bob
Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks.
Terrance
Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you.
Ugly Bob
Thanks, you guys.
They part ways.
Terrance and Phillip's House 12:20 P.M.
Phillip
Hello Barky. Hello Purry.
Barky
Bark, bark.
Purry
Purr, purr.
Phillip
Say Terrance, I was just aboot to make some Kroff Dinner. Would you like some?
Terrance
You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip.
Terrance farts. He and the animals laugh.
Terrance
I'm going to put on a pirate costume.
Terrance goes to his room. The door bell rings. Phillip opens the door.
Delivery Man
Special delivery for Terrance.
He smokes a pipe. The delivery is a letter.
Phillip
I'll take that.
Delivery Man
Sign here, and here, and here, and here, and here. [Signs all the forms.] And here. [Signs the last one.]
Phillip
Ooh, Terrannce! [The delivery man leaves.] You got a letter!
Terrance
[Now dressed as a pirate.] Shiver me timbers, Phillip. At this rate I'll never get to my Kroff Dinner. [Reads the letter.] Oh my God!
Phillip
What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?
Terrance
No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
Phillip
Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally? God, why? Say, Terrance, who's Sally?
Terrance
My daughter.
Phillip
I never know you had a daughter, Terrance.
Terrance
Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?
Phillip
No, you never did, Terrance.
Terrance
Oh. Well. It all began fifteen years ago.
44 HOURS LATER...
Phillip
My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion.
Terrance
Yes, indeed. [Takes off the hat.] But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran. [Takes off the eye patch.] And I will have to go and find her.
Phillip
Then I'll go with you, Terrance.
Terrance
You're such a good friend, Phillip.
Phillip
Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kroff Dinner.
Terrance
Avast there, mateys.
Celine Dion's House 1:15 P.M. Terrance arrives and rings the doorbell.
Terrance
Hello, Celine Dion.
Celine Dion
Terrance, this is quite a surprise.
Terrance
You're looking well.
Celine Dion
And you.
Terrance
Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?
Celine Dion
She's in the Middle East, studying anthropology. Why?
Terrance
Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner.
Celine Dion
What?!
Terrance
Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return.
Celine Dion
[Gasps.] Oh, Terrance. What happened to us?
Terrance
We just grew apart, Celine Dion. [He turns to leave.]
Celine Dion
Please, bring our daughter home safe, Terrance.
He farts and they both laugh.
Canadian Airport 11:05 A.M. Terrance and Phillip are there to purchase tickets to Iran.
Phillip
Hello, Ugly Bob.
Ugly Bob
Hi, guys.
Terrance
How's the paper bag working out?
Ugly Bob
People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
Terrance
Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please.
Ugly Bob
Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there!
Phillip
Dammit man! [Bangs on the counter.] Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!!
Terrance laughs nervously.
Ugly Bob
All right, then. There's a flight leaving today.
Phillip
Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance.
Terrance
In-deed, Phillip.
Phillip
Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kroff Dinner.
Terrance
Same here, Phillip!
Phillip
O Ca-nada,
Our home and native land,

Terrance/Phillip
True patriot love,
In all thy sons' command,

Small Group
[Terrance, Phillip, Ugly Bob, and two others]
With glowing hearts we see thee rise,

Middling Group
[Four more...]
The True North, strong and free

Larger Group
[The folks at the kiosk join in.]
From far and wide, O Canada,
We stand on guard for thee,

Crowd
God keep our land...

Scott peeks out from behind a corner, talking to Saddam on a cell phone.
Scott
Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon.
Saddam
Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon.
Scott
The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
Saddam
Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
Scott
Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
Saddam
Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain.
Scott
Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out.
He puts the phone away.
Scott
[To himself.] I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers.
On the flight to Tehran, Terrance and Phillip leave British Columbia, fly over the western and southwestern U.S., and over the Gulf of Mexico. Over the Yucatan Peninsula Terrance farts, they laugh, and the plane turns towards the Atlantic.
Terrance
I Got Ya.
They laugh again. Over the Pyrenees, Phillip farts, the plane moves towards North Africa, then turns again for Italy.
Phillip
Burned your face.
The plane heads for Egypt, where another fart forces it towards the Black Sea. Once they cross it, another fart forces the plane to cross the Black Sea again...
Terrance
Ow, that's rancid. hahahahaha.
It then turns towards Iran when it is in southern Turkey. It lands in...
Tehran 2:30 P.M. Terrance and Phillip walk among the crowds in the city.
Terrance
Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin.
Phillip
Oh, look. There she is.
He points at a girl wearing a yellow dress and pink bow - not Arab dress in the least.
Terrance
Oh, good.
They make their way to her.
Sally
Goo. Where?
Terrance
I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance.
He picks her up in his arms.
Terrance
I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
Sally
Pa-pa.
Phillip
Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance.
Sally farts.
Phillip
Oh, now I see the resemblance!
Terrance
Well, enough of Iran, let's get home.
On the flight home she farts again and Terrance and Phillip laugh.
Canadian Airport 3:45 P.M. The plane lands.
Terrance
Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again.
Phillip
Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend.
Terrance
No, you're gaining a pop vocalist.
Phillip notices something.
Phillip
Oh my God! [Terrance looks.] What is this?!
There are pictures of Saddam Hussein plastered all over the city, and ominous music plays.
Phillip
Is this Canada?
Terrance
It seems to have changed.
Phillip
This is madness!
Terrance
What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?
Phillip
I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?
Terrance
I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
Celine Dion's House 4:02 P.M. Terrance and Phillip arrive with Sally. Terrance knocks, and Celine opens the door.
Terrance
Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--
Celine Dion
Terrance, ha, could you come back a little later?
Terrance
Why?!
Celine Dion
Ah, I'm just a little busy right now.
Terrance
You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?
Celine Dion
Well, I...
Ugly Bob comes out behind her.
Ugly Bob
Hi guys.
Phillip
Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!
Terrance
What the hell are you doing here?!
Ugly Bob
I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
Terrance
Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!
Celine Dion
What do you mean? Why are you calling him "Ugly Bob"?
Phillip
Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!
She turns to Ugly Bob.
Celine Dion
You told me your name "Handsome Bob"!
Terrance
Look at him, Celine Dion.
Terrance pulls the bag off.
Celine Dion
Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhhhh!!!
Phillip
Behold his horrible face.
Celine Dion
Oh my God, he's hideously ugly! And I am pregnant with his child!
Terrance
What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!
Celine Dion
I'm going to have a freak baby!!
Phillip
Ohh, the humanity!!
Saddam Hussein's Canadian HQ. 4:03 P.M. Scott enters the cabin.
Scott
Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?
Saddam
Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest.
Scott
...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot.
Saddam
Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran.
Scott
I thought you were from Iraq.
Saddam
Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!
Downtown Canada 4:04 P.M. Saddam's troops are filing past the buildings as Terrance and Phillip look on. Terrance farts and the two laugh.
Terrance
Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada.
Phillip
Yes. I agree whole-fartedly.
They laugh. Scott rushes up to them.
Scott
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?
Terrance
Oh, hello, Scott.
Scott
You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--
Puts left hand to mouth.
Scott
Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?
Phillip
Wait, what were you saying?
Scott
Nothing, why?
Terrance
Hey, Scott. Guess what?
Scott
What?
Terrance farts and they laugh.
Scott
Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both!
He then puts his fists forth and concentrates mightily on them. They simply stand back.
Phillip
What are you doing, Scott?
Scott
I'm wishing cancer upon you.
Phillip
Cancer?!
Scott
That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
Terrance
Ooh, stop that!
He grabs Phillip as a shield, then pulls him back.
Phillip
Hey, don't give me cancer!
Scott advances.
Saddam Hussein's Canadian HQ. 4:05 P.M. Two U.S. Army Officials arrive.
U.S. Army Official
Mr. Hussein, the U.S. Government is becoming worried.
Saddam
Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax.
U.S. Army Official
You seem to be... taking over Canada.
Saddam
Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs.
U.S. Army Official
We didn't say anything about bombs.
Saddam
Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax.
U.S. Army Official
We're giving you just three years to clear your forces out of Canada, and after that, we're gonna bomb all of Iran.
Saddam
I'm from Iraq.
U.S. Army Official
Iran, Iraq, what's the difference?
The officials leave.
Guard on Right
Euugh. I hate Americans. Please, let me kill them!
Saddam
No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world!
He laughs wickedly and rolls all over his desk.
Scott
[Returning.] What's so funny!
Saddam
Nothing! Relax, brother.
Scott
Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!
Saddam
Oh, really?
Scott
You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
Saddam
[Thumps his desk.] I changed my mind. [Thumps his desk again.] Pray that I don't change it any further.
The guard on the right cocks his machine gun and Scott is chagrined.
Scott
This deal's getting worse all the time.
Terrance and Phillip's House 4:06 P.M. They are at home eating Kroff Dinner on the sofa.
Phillip
Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television.
Terrance
Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
Phillip
Oh look. Here's a show. [Jerry Springer.]
Woman 1
...well fuck you.
Woman 2
Arrrggghh! [Lunges at woman 1.]
Springer
And this is what life would be like...
Terrance
It's so stupid!
Phillip
Goddamn, their TV shows are lame!
The next show they see is South Park.
Mephesto
The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is--
Terrance and Phillip laugh over the line.
Phillip
Look at their silly American heads.
Terrance
They look like groundhogs.
Cartman
He's my father?!
Phillip clicks a new channel.
Anchor
And in other news it appears that Saddam Hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the U.S. inspect his military operations. When asked if he would uphold his side of the agreement, Hussein replied, quote: "Hey, relax, fella. You need a rest, guy."
Terrance
Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?
Phillip
Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator.
Terrance
Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kroff Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks!
The phone rings, and they laugh.
Phillip
That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance.
Terrance
It sure did, Phillip.
The phone rings again, and Terrance looks.
Terrance
Oh, wait. That is the phone.
He sets his plate aside and gets up to answer it.
Terrance
Hello?
Scott
Terrance, this is Scott.
Terrance
Oh. [To Phillip.] Hey, it's Scott.
He covers the receiver while Phillip answers.
Phillip
Tell him he's a smelly bastard.
Terrance
Phillip says hello, Scott.
Scott
Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.
Terrance
You are such a dick, Scott.
Scott
You're a dick.
Terrance
You're a dick.
Scott
You're a dick.
Terrance
You're a dick.
Scott
You're a dick.
Terrance
You're a dick.
Scott
[Pause.] You're a dick.
Terrance
You're a dick.
Scott
The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada. You give other Canadians a bad name. And if I had my hair-
Terrance
I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?
Scott
Sure.
Terrance raises his left leg, places the receiver between his legs, and farts on it. He and Phillip laugh as he lowers his leg.
Terrance
How do you like that, Scott?!
Scott
You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
Terrance
Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?
Scott
Sure.
Terrance raises his left leg, places the receiver between his legs, and farts on it. He lowers his leg and resumes talking.
Terrance
Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'
Scott
Goddammit!
Terrance
Oh, wait a second, Scott.
Scott
Sure.
Terrance raises his left leg...
Scott
I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour. [Hangs up.]
Celine Dion's House 4:07 P.M. Celine Dion and Ugly Bob are back in bed.
Celine Dion
Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly.
She puffs on a cigarette.
Ugly Bob
Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
Celine Dion
We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.
Three Republican Guards burst through the bedroom door, and Saddam follows.
Celine Dion
What's this?! [Gasps.]
Saddam
He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.
Ugly Bob
Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch.
Saddam
Eh! Who are you?
Ugly Bob
I'm Bob. But my friends call me "Ugly Bob", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim.
Saddam
Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.
Bob takes off the bag and everybody in the room screams.
Saddam
Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours.
Bob and Celine now look at him.
Ugly Bob
You can?
Saddam
Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
Celine Dion
What? Why?
Saddam
Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it. Look over here. All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?
Ugly Bob
Did you say, "hostile takeover of Canada"?
Saddam
No, no, relax there, fella!
Celine takes another bag and places it over Bob's head.
Karl's Kroff Dinner Palace 4:36 P.M. Terrance and Phillip are there. So are some pictures of Saddam.
Terrance
Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up.
Phillip farts and they laugh.
Phillip
Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?
Terrance
Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure.
Phillip looks around, but Terrance ends up looking at his feet.
Scott
[Arrives.] What are you idiots doing?
Terrance
We're looking for treasure!
Scott
Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
Phillip
No, we're searching for treasure.
Scott
Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
Terrance
Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
Scott
Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?
Phillip
What do you mean?
Scott
It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! [they gasp.]
Phillip
You mean, we are to blame?!
Scott
That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this.
He hands him a box with a watch face on it.
Phillip
What is this?
Scott
It's a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions.
Terrance
That plan's scary!
Scott
Well, you must do it for Canada.
Phillip
For Canada, Terrance.
A display of solidarity begins. He puts his arm behind Terrance.
Terrance
For Canada, Phillip.
Terrance puts his arm behind Phillip. Then they let go and leave.
Scott
Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.
Terrance and Phillip's House 12:20 P.M.
Terrance
Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.
Phillip
Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.
Terrance farts, and they laugh.
Terrance
That's funny!
Phillip
Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
Terrance
Why is that?
Phillip
That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?
Terrance
Yes. Apparently, he does.
Phillip
Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
Terrance
Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.
Phillip
I do, Terrance.
Phillip picks up the receiver and dials away... Barky comes up and farts, then leaves. Terrance and Phillip laugh.
Canada Stadium 11:32 A.M.
Announcer
And the Roughriders are giving the Roughriders a run for their money! [Not if the score is valid: 28-7.] All else aside, I must say that the Roughriders [To his right.] are simply outmatched by these Roughriders [To his left. Red and blue Roughriders go after the football and time runs out. A horn blows and the referee blows his whistle.] And that's going to take us to halftime. Be sure to stick around for the halftime show: Saddam and the Electric Iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers!
A long platform is put together from two shorter ones, each one having half the Canadian flag. The flag is made whole when the platforms are put together. A band plays and walks across the field and the crowd cheers.
Terrance
Well, I guess it's time, old friend.
Phillip
Yes. Prepare the alert!
Saddam climbs onto the platform with some difficulty, then rights himself and takes the microphone.
Saddam
Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.
He waits for a reaction, but none comes.
Saddam
You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as "New Baghdad!" Qoloh Qalah!
A Canadian flag is taken down from its pole and an Iraqi one put up in its place. An Iraqi one is placed over the Canadian one on the platform. The audience gasps.
Saddam
You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!
Celine Dion and Ugly Bob are standing by as Saddam laughs derisively.
Saddam
And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem...
A guard nudges Celine towards the microphone with the tip of his machine gun.
Saddam
Or you will be stabbed in the head!
Celine Dion
Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht...
Terrance
Now, Phlllip?
Phlllip
Now, Terrance.
He puts on his gas-mask while Terrance brings out a bugle and sounds the alert. Everyone in the stadium then puts on masks.
Saddam
Hey!! What the hell is this?
Celine puts on her mask.
Celine
Freh kashu kaliakaliakatchut...
People all around the stadium turn around and start to drop trousers, and fart. One man stands on his hands, leaving his derriere high in the air with legs spread open. A brown cloud starts to form over the stadium and it descends into the gridiron. Saddam starts to gag.
Guard
They're using chemical warfare! How could they?!
More brown clouds sweep across the field and seem to sweep Saddam along with them. He stumbles to the edge of the platform and the crowd cheers loudly. He finally falls and the clouds start to lift away. The Iraqi flag falls off the side of the platform as the people remove their masks and cheer some more.
Terrance
We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!
Phillip
Oh, Glorious Day!
Some people come down and start kicking Saddam around. Bob and Celine take off their masks while holding hands. She takes her hand away and quickly places a paper bag on Bob's head. A woman takes Saddam's left arm, a man takes his head. Terrance and Phillip come down from their seats and rush to the platform, and all stadium seats are now empty. Terrance and Celine hold hands.
Celine Dion
Phillip, Terrance! You've saved Canada!
Terrance
Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea.
They progress to full embrace.
Ugly Bob
God bless you, Phillip. [Embraces him.]
Phillip
[Pulls away.] Don't touch me, Ugly Bob!
Scott
[Walking up.] Hey, What the hell happened? You were supposed to be blown up!
Phillip
We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada.
Scott
Oh! That is so juvenile!
Terrance and Celine have let go of each other.
Terrance
Hey, Scott, you like apples?
Scott
Of course!
Terrance
[Farts on him.] How do you like them apples? [Laughs heartily.]
Scott
I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!! [Goes away.]
Terrance
Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
Celine Dion
You're right, Terrance. You're right.
She walks forth and grabs the microphone
Celine Dion
O Canada, our home and native land,

Celine, Terrance, Bob, Phillip, and people on the field
Crowd
True patriot love in all thy sons command

Large Crowd
With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
the True North, strong and free,

A man uses Saddam's head like that of a dummy and provides a falsetto for it. The words scroll across the scoreboard.
Crowd outside
From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee
God keep our land glorious and free
Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee

The camera pulls away from the stadium, and then from Canada, as if on a plane. More crowds are seen, then some cabins, some mountains, and finally a moose.
Crowd
Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee

The whole scene is now framed in a maple-leaf outline, with the moose in the center grazing. He looks up. When the anthem ends Terrance farts once more and laughs away. His laughter echoes.
End credits roll and theme music plays.
Announcer 1
Who is Eric Cartman's father? Find out on an all new South Park, in just a few weeks.

	South Park.
Announcer 2
Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy.
A shot of Cartman chowing down on cookies and milk.
Announcer 1
Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you will know the answer.
Opening warning and theme song. Much has been added. Then the episode resumes at the laboratory.
Mephesto
And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room.
Cartman
Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
Kenny is restored to the story line. Kyle notices.
Stan
Oooh- hey, Kenny.
Mephesto
Gentlemen, the father is...
The lights go out.
Mr. Garrison
Hey, what the hell's going on?
Jimbo
It's a power outage!
Two gunshots, then a body is heard falling. The lights go back on and the men settle down.
Chef
Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
Officer Barbrady
Oh my God, look!
Mephesto lies shot on the floor, his ass-headed cane next to him.
Kenny
(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)
Kyle
You bastards!
Mr. Garrison
Mephesto's been shot.
Everyone gathers around Mephesto.
Chef
Is he ...dead?
Jimbo and Ned stand near a newly broken window.
Jimbo
Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!
Mr. Garrison
Then who was it?
Announcer 1
Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
Cartman
Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
Announcer 1
Or was it Sheila Broflovski?
Chef
[Listening to Mephesto's chest.] Waait! [Getting up.] He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
Cartman
[Grabbing Mephesto's shirt.] Goddammit! Who's my father?
Chef
[About to lift Mephesto.] We've got to get him to the hospital.
Cartman
You've got to be kidding me!
Chef
Come on, children!
Chef carries Mephesto out the door. Cartman follows.
Cartman
Eeeehh..!
Gerald Broflovski
Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this.
Ms. Cartman sighs deeply and moves away.
Jimbo
There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
Announcer 1
Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
Chef is driving up a hill with the kids and Mephesto.
Cartman
Is he awake yet?
Kyle
[Checking.] He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
Chef
Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
Kyle
What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
Chef
I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to... [Mad at himself.] Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
Stan
Could you pull over so I can get out?
Chef
What? We have to get to the hospital.
Stan
I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
Chef
Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?
Kyle
Man, it's really starting to snow.
The scene outside is filled with snow falling as Chef drives by.
Kyle
I hope they don't close the roads.
Cartman
They can't. Mephesto can't die.
Kyle
Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman.
Cartman
No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, "Come Sail Away", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
Kyle
Really?
Cartman
Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
Kyle looks at Stan, who looks back. Kyle begins.
Kyle
I'm sailing away...

Cartman
No! Don't!
Kyle
Set an open course for the virgin sea...

Cartman tries to resist, but the pull is just too strong.
Cartman
Eh--
Two short gasps follow, then Cartman races through...
Cartman
For I've got to be free,
Free to face the life that's ahead of me,
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard,
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore,
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on,
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay,
A gathering of angels appeared above my head,
They sang to us this song of hope,
And this is what they said,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me

The car passes a sign for Hell's Pass Hospital.
Cartman
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads

Cartman is out of breath, breathing heavily, Chef keeps driving.
Kyle
Whoa, dude!
City Hall, first night. Sheila, Officer Barbrady, Sharon, and Jimbo are assembled before the Mayor.
Jimbo
What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!
Sheila
We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
Sharon
Uh... Where are our children?
They look around.
Mayor McDaniels
Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?
Officer Barbrady
Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking.
A man and his boom mic operator rush in.
Man
Mayor! Mayor!
Mayor McDaniels
[Aside to an aide.] The press is here.
Sid Greenfield
My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
Mayor McDaniels
[Amazed.] Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.
Greenfield
We're desperate for stories.
The boom mic operator thumps him.
Greenfield
A-and this one is so compelling.
Mayor McDaniels
[Aroused.] Really??
Greenfield
Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
Officer Barbrady
Hey, I thought of something. [Close-up.] Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction.
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?
Jimbo
Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--
Mayor McDaniels
Shh.
Greenfield
We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins.
Mayor McDaniels
Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
Greenfield
Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family.
Cameraman
It is?
Mayor McDaniels
[Thoughtfully.] Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay!
Greenfield
Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
Announcer 1
Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?
At the Unplanned Parenthood Clinic, it is snowing.
Liane
I want to have... an abortion.
Receptionist
Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs...
Liane
Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world.
Receptionist
Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?
Liane
About eight years ago.
Receptionist
[Processing.] ...I sseee, so the fetus is...
Liane
Eight years old.
Receptionist
Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion.
Liane
Really?
Receptionist
Yes, this is what we would refer to as the "fortieth trimester".
Liane
But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
Receptionist
Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester.
Liane
Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body.
Receptionist
Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman.
Liane
[Rises from the chair.] Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day!
She leaves, meanwhile at the Hell's Pass Hospital, Chef and the children have arrived.
Chef
Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! [Kenny follows him in.]
Stan
[Stops.] Ugh. I can't do it, dude. [Kyle and Cartman pass him.]
Kyle
Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
Cartman
Yeah, stop being a wuss!
Operating room. A patient lies on the table, and the doctor is being assisted by a female nurse with no arms below the elbow. Chef and the kids enter.
Chef
Doctor!
Dr. Doctor
One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat!
She reaches for the syringe and grabs it with her mouth.
Kyle
Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
Dr. Doctor
We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son.
She spits out the syringe, and he catches it along the cartridge end.
Chef
Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
Dr. Doctor
I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle.
Stan
[Pained.] Oh man. [Grabs his stomach.] I'm gonna be sick.
Dr. Doctor
There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of.
Squeezes out any air left in the syringe. A few drops escape, and he rams the needle into the man's side.
Stan
Oogh.
Scraping sounds are now heard.
Nurse
Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone.
Stan
Ooooogh.
Dr. Doctor is still driving the syringe.
Dr. Doctor
Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.
Blood starts bursting from the injection site.
Dr. Doctor
Oops, he's hemorrhaging.
A burst lands next to Stan, who is wide-eyed at this point.
Stan
Aghh!
Dr. Doctor
[Plop.] Ooo! His head fell off.
Stan
I'm gotta get outta here!
Kyle
Stan!
Dr. Doctor
Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach.
America's Most Wanted temporary set.
Greenfield is accompanied by his assistant in the auditorium.
Mephesto Tryout
And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot! [Drops the cane.]
Greenfield
Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you. [The actor departs.] I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Mister-uhh Garrison.
Assistant
Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!
Garrison 1
Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat 1
[Just a sock with two purple disks for eyes.] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!
Greenfield
Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!
Mr. Garrison
I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!
Greenfield
Thank you! Next!
Mr. Garrison
[Shocked.] What?
Greenfield
Next!
Mr. Garrison leaves, dejected, as another actor enters.
Garrison 2
[An actor with a deep voice.] I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat 2
[A fist with a face drawn on it.] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
Greenfield
Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs!
Mr. Garrison stands dumbstruck. Meanwhile Liane is in bed with her congressman.
Liane
...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed.
O'Reilly
Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th.
Liane
But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
O'Reilly
No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff.
Liane
Oh, dear.
Back at the hospital, Mephest is still on the operating table, sedated.
Dr. Doctor
Well, this is about all I can do for him.
Cartman
Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
Dr. Doctor
Sorry, son, it might be a while.
Cartman bounds atop Mephesto and begins slapping him around.
Cartman
Wake up, you son of a bitch!
Chef
Whoa!
Dr. Doctor lowers Cartman from atop Mephesto.
Dr. Doctor
Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition.
Cartman
I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
Kyle
Hey, Cartman.
Cartman
What?
Kyle
I'm sailing ay...

Cartman
--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...

Stan
Okay okay, let's get outta here now!
Cartman
...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...

Kyle
[Looking out at the snow storm.] I don't know if that's gonna be too easy.
Cartman
...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on...

Dr. Doctor
My God, that's a hell of a storm.
Cartman
I look to the sea; Reflections--
--in the waves spark my memory...

Stan
Oh, weak.
Kenny looks up towards the window.
Cartman
...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--

Back at the studio, auditions have ended, Greenfield is looking at the storm.
Greenfield
God, I hate mountains. This better not push back our shooting schedule.
The actors for Mephesto, Barbrady, and Chef are on the laboratory stage. Greenfield takes the megaphone.
Greenfield
Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it.
Greenfield sees a new actor and turns to his assistant.
Greenfield
Who's that?
Assistant
Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to get him to play the part of the little monkey guy.
Greenfield
Whoa. Talk about "all washed-up", huh? Great to have you, Eric!
Eric Roberts stops munching a doughnut long enough to wave and smile.
Greenfield
Here we go, aaand action.
Mephesto Actor
I want to announce who the father is.
Greenfield
Bang!!
Mephesto Actor
Oh, I've been shot! [Falls over.]
Barbrady Actor
Nobody move! I'm a law officer!
Chef Actor
My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!
Mephesto Actor
[As Chef Actor speaks] Whoaw..!
Barbrady Actor
You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef.
Chef Actor
Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!
Barbrady Actor
Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job.
Officer Barbrady
Whoa, this is a good movie!
Back at the hospital.
Cartman
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee

The boys are in the emergency room with a bunch of patients bleeding, getting nauseous, etc.
Stan
Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
The doctor bursts through the emergency doors with the nurse, a blonde is bleeding from a gash on her neck.
Blonde
Doctor, I can't focus!
Dr. Doctor
We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly.
She tosses the stethoscope around for a better hold.
Chef
Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
Dr. Doctor
Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked.
Everyone turns to him and gasps. He quickly retracts.
Dr. Doctor
Metaphorically speaking, that is.
Cartman
What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
Dr. Doctor
He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.
Bzht. Everything goes black.
Dr. Doctor
Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?
Show time! A siren rotates, there's a hold-up and a helicopter zooms in on a raid from above. There's also a ground shot of the arrest. Lady Justice appears. A suspect is thrown behind bars.
Voice-over
Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your host, John Walsh.
John Walsh
Good evening and welcome to America's Most Wanted. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto [His picture appears.] was gunned down in his laboratory. America's Most Wanted has reconstructed this heinous crime [The South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch is seen.] in hopes that your calls could help solve the case.
A reenactment plays.
Mephesto Actor
[Pfff. The actors flinch and he throws away the cane] I've been shot!
Garrison Actor
[Catches him.] My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help!
Mr. Hat Actor
Right away, Mr. Garrison.
Eric Roberts as Kevin
No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?
Greenfield
What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
Chef Actor
I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?
Eric Roberts
This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--
Greenfield
God-dammit!
Outside, a pine tree falls on the studio's power lines. The lights dim and all action comes to a halt.
Greenfield
What the hell is this?!
Cameraman
We've lost the feed to L.A.
John Walsh
Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
Announcer 1
Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?
Greenfield
Somebody go see why we lost the hookup!
The doors fly open and snow is swept in.
Jimbo
Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!
Back at the hospital. Lights can be seen in most of the rooms. Inside, the backup generator has come online and everyone is running around.
Nurse Goodly
Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine.
Dr. Doctor
[Opening the operating room doors wide.] Nurse, I could use some help in here!
Goodly
Coming!
Cartman stands in her way stopping her.
Cartman
Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
Goodly
Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short.
Dr. Doctor
Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!
She looks at him and glares.
Dr. Doctor
Oh, sorry.
Liane at the Governor's mansion, in bed with him.
Liane
Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one.
Governor
[Smoking.] Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm.
He edges closer to her.
Liane
I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know...
Back at the hospital.
Dr. Doctor
Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly.
Chef
What do you want me to do?
Dr. Doctor
Do you know anything about surgery?
Chef
I used to watch Quincy.
Dr. Doctor
What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives.
Stan
No way, dude!
America's Most Wanted studio, in the dark, Jimbo opens the door and a pile of snow pours in on him.
Jimbo
Well, [Opens his right eye.] we're not going anywhere for a loong time.
Greenfield
We're snowed in?
Mayor McDaneils
Yes. We're trapped!
Mr. Garrison
[Snuggling up to Greenfield.] Like sailors on a submarine.
Mayor McDaniels
My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen.
Assistant
Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast.
Officer Barbrady
Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too. [Rubs his belly.]
Jimbo
I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.
Everyone is now focused on Jimbo.
Jimbo
Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive.
Gasps are heard all around.
Greenfield
Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?
Jimbo
That's the law of land, Mr. Director. It ain't pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it.
Mayor McDaniels
Buut, how do we decide "who"?
Jimbo
Well, we draw straws.
Greenfield
Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?
Jimbo
Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws.
Greenfield
Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
Announcer 1
Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--
Same night, the hospital. The doctor is operating with his motley crew. Stan and Kyle are on one side, Cartman and Kenny are on the other. Chef stands at one end of the table between Cartman and Kyle, and the doctor is at the other end.
Dr. Doctor
Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me. [Stan raises his brows.] Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms. [He withdraws.] Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?
Stan
No.
Dr. Doctor
Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart.
Stan
[Queasily.] Oh boy.
The doctor slices the flesh vertically over the X he has marked over the heart. It splits open and Stan removes his mask.
Stan
Bleech!
The vomit goes right into the open incision.
Kyle
Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
Cartman
Sweet.
Dr. Doctor
Suction!
Kenny places the suction cup over the incision. The power begins to flicker, and he removes the cup.
Cartman
Hey, who's screwing with the lights?
Announcer 1
Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
Cartman
[To Kenny.] That is really starting to piss me off.
America's Most Wanted studio, nighttime. Barbrady stands holding the straws.
Jimbo
Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing. [Draws.] Whew.
Mr. Garrison
[Draws] Whew.
Sees that his straw is short and throws it away, behind himself.
Officer Barbrady
Wooo!
Jimbo
Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
Officer Barbrady
The short what?
Jimbo
Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!
Barbrady
That's not how I played it!
Mr. Garrison
Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling.
Back at the hospital.
Dr. Doctor
I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital.
Chef
So how do we get to it?
Dr. Doctor
We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny.
Kenny is stunned. The doctor pats his head.
Dr. Doctor
Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.
Dr. Doctor points it out to him on the map.
Dr. Doctor
Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here [Points to it.] where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here.
He points to an area between the holding area and the generator.
Dr. Doctor
Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?
Cartman
Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.
Dr. Doctor
Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!
Kenny
(Huh?)
The studio.
Mr. Garrison
I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...
Mayor McDaniels
We're all going to die in this horrible place. [She covers her eyes.]
Jimbo
We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
Greenfield
How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
Jimbo
There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts. [He's shown squatting on the floor.]
Mayor McDaniels
[Thoughtfully.] Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.
Mr. Garrison
[Madly] Eat Eric Roberts!
The rest of the group goes mad, Ned gets up and everyone prepares to do him in.
Eric Roberts
No! No, please!
Later. Eric's arms, legs, and head have been removed, and bees hover around the corpse.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, there's no going back now. [Ned and Jimbo keep eating.] We're cannibals. [Someone burps.] God save us.
Jimbo
God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!
Assistant
[Coolly.] Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected.
Greenfield
[Miffed.] Aaww.
Mr. Garrison
This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it.
Jimbo
What time is it, Barbrady?
Barbrady
It's almost midnight.
Mr. Garrison
Oh! I can't... go on. [Drops to his side.]
Jimbo
We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.
Greenfield
What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?
The hospital. Kenny has made it through the tunnel and exits the manhole. He's pretty soiled. He turns on his communicator.
Dr. Doctor
Team B? Come in, Team B.
Kenny
(This is Team B.)
Dr. Doctor
Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage.
Kenny
(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
Dr. Doctor
Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left.
Kenny
(Yup! I see it in the drift.)
Dr. Doctor
Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
Cartman
What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
Kenny heads toward the generator and a dinosaur casts its shadow on both of them.
The studio. Ned, Jimbo and the Mayor are eating again. The camera shows that Greenfield and the assistant have joined Eric Roberts as casualties to cannibalism. Barbrady is seen working on a leg and some ribs.
Mayor McDaniels
My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.
Jimbo
It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.
Announcer 1
Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?
The generator. Kenny has opened the door and is ready for new orders.
Kenny
(Okay, I've reached the generator)
Dr. Doctor
Roger, Team B. [To Team A.] He's reached the backup generator. [To Kenny.] Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?
Kenny
(Roger.)
Dr. Doctor
Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?
Kenny
(Negative.)
Dr. Doctor
Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed.
Kyle
D'you have any wire here?
Dr. Doctor
There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
Kenny
(I'll stick 'em together)
Dr. Doctor
No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands.
Kyle
No, he'll die!
Cartman
Go, Kenny!
Dr. Doctor
Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
Kenny
(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastard!
The lights stabilize.
Chef
The power!
Dr. Doctor
Quickly! Get the scanner running again!
The scanner is brought in.
Dr. Doctor
We've got a chance now!
The White House. Liane has bedded her way up to the President, and she's in bed with him now.
President Bill Clinton
Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you.
Liane
[Relieved and joyful.] Oh, thank you, thank you.
Clinton
We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately. [Her eyes widen.]
Liane
[Pulls back.] Terminated?
Clinton
Why yes, that's what an abortion is.
Liane
Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
Clinton
Adoption?
Liane
Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption.
Clinton
Well, that's- pretty different.
Liane
Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President.
She quickly leaves the bed. Now to a Colorado sunrise.
Dr. Doctor
Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine.
Mephesto
[Coming to.] Where... where am I?
Chef
You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--
Mephesto
Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
Chef
Ooohhh.
Dr. Doctor
Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
Chef
He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
Outside, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are at the generator. I guess the raptors have left.
Stan
He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
Kyle
He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
Cartman
Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.
Kenny is shown iced over, and the boys simply stare.
Stan
[To Kyle.] Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
Kyle
I don't know. Let's find out.
"Ave Maria" begins to play. Jimbo is the first to shovel his way out of the studio. Mr. Garrison follows, then Ned, then the Mayor, then...
Mr. Garrison
Ohh. It's over! We're free!
Officer Barbrady
Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?
Jimbo
Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.
Mayor McDaniels
But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
Ned
Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time.
Singer
[A la Aaron Neville]
Ave Maria...

[The camera pulls back, and back...]
Mr. Garrison
Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?
The hospital. Mephesto is recuperating, and Kevin is back at his side. All the possible fathers are present, including the Denver Broncos.
Mephesto
I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--
Cartman
Just tell us already!
Mephesto
Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--
Cartman
[Boiling.] Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
Mephesto
Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman. [All gasp.]
Chef
What???
Liane
[Back with her cookies.] Yes, it's true.
Mr. Garrison
Noo, that doesn't make sense!
Mephesto
Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite. [She looks guilty.]
Mr. Garrison
Uh-meaning what?
Mephesto
Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
Liane
It's true.
Chef
You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!
Mephesto
No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis.
Ned, Barbrady, and Chef vomit. The rest just cup their mouths. Gerald is shocked.
Mephesto
The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Cartman
Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.
Stan
Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
Liane
I'm sorry I never told you, Eric.
Eric and Stan look up at her.
Liane
I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.
Cartman
Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
Mephesto
Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing.
Cartman
No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!
Announcer 1
Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
Cartman
Ooohhh, forget it!

	South Park Elementary, out front. Garrison and the class stand next to a colorful bus.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus.
Cartman
[To Kyle.] Reading sucks ass.
Mr. Garrison
Eric, shut up! [Eric looks up.]
Inside the bus. The kids mill around and start browsing.
Kyle
Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
Stan
[At the next stack.] Hey you guys. Check out these books. [They come over.] Sabrina Unchained.
Kyle
Wow, these books look cool!
Cartman smiles. They look at romance novels. Kyle takes "Seduction", Kenny takes "Bound to Love", Cartman takes "Body to Body".
Cartman
Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books.
Kenny
(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
Bus Driver
[Stops by.] Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading.
He is wearing a blue suit, with rainbow shirt and cape.
Kyle
Who are you?
Bus Driver
I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading.
Cartman
[Irritated.] God, shut up, dude.
Bus Driver
Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic. [He floats away.]
Stan
[To Kyle.] If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
Kyle
Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical.
Kyle tosses his book away.
Cartman
I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these.
A man and woman are kissing on the cover of his chosen book. Off in the distance a chicken clucks and a woman shrieks.
Kenny
(Hey, what's that?)
Stan
I don't know. Let's go see.
They drop their books and exit the bus. Cartman is glued to his.
Here's a show within a show: an episode of COPS shown in real time along with South Park.
Officer Barbrady
Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong.
Dispatcher 1
[Through intercom.] All units. All units. Report to 254 Avenue de los Mexicanos. Possible hostile situation.
Officer Barbrady puts his siren light up on the dashboard.
Officer Barbrady
There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town!
Dispatcher
And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home.
Officer Barbrady
Goddammit!
A crowd has gathered at the site of the incident, across the street from the school. The boys are there, front and center. Officer Barbrady pulls up with the COPS film crew, and his siren light is now on the car roof.
Officer Barbrady
Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here. [To the rancher.] What's the trouble? Where's the body?
Rancher
Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens.
Barbrady says nothing as the crew films him for a long pause.
Officer Barbrady
Uhhhh... oh.
The chicken doesn't seem traumatized one bit.
Woman
My God, that's disgusting!
Stan
Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
Officer Barbrady
Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see. [To the rancher.] Did you get a good look at the suspect?
Rancher
Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast.
Officer Barbrady
Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?
Cameraman
Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond.
The crew leaves.
Officer Barbrady
Haw, camel poo.
Stan
Hey, what's this?
Stan picks up a sheet of paper.
Kyle
It looks like a note.
Officer Barbrady
Give me that! [Takes the note.] That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!
Rancher
[Coming over.] What does it say?
The note reads: Another chicken gets it tomorrow!
Officer Barbrady
Uhh... It says, uuh, "Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye." Well, there you have it. Case closed.
Rancher
Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say "Nothin' to see here", and "Case closed." But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!
Officer Barbrady
I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people.
Rancher
For what? Orderly conduct?
Officer Barbrady
How about fishing without a license?
Rancher
I'm not fishin'.
Officer Barbrady
Whataya call this then?
He pulls a fishing rod out from somewhere.
Officer Barbrady
If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you... [Pulls out his gun.] by gunshot to the head.
The crowd quickly disperses, the boys remain.
Officer Barbrady
That's right, return to your simple lives. [Puts his gun away] Just forget this ever happened. Forget.
He moves off, leaving the boys with the chicken.
Officer Barbrady
For-get.
Kyle
Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
Stan
Yeah, I wonder what's wrong.
The patrol car. Barbrady gets in and looks at the note again. The letters become unintelligible symbols. He starts up the car and throws the note away. He stops at a stop sign, and its letters turn into Korean symbols. He drives on and ends up at Fran's.
Teller
Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?
The letters in the board above the speaker are jumbled as they are, but they start whirling around, and Barbrady is speechless.
Teller
Sir, can I help you?
The letters A, C, K, R, and U stop whirling and start laughing at him.
Officer Barbrady
Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeño poppers.
Teller
Sure, there's just one problem.
Officer Barbrady
What's that?
Teller
We're a bank.
The board is back to normal.
Officer Barbrady
I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?
Teller
Yes.
Officer Barbrady
Hmmm. [Drives away.] I can't go on living this lie!
Channel 4 Breaking News.
Anchor
With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions.
Reporter 1
Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act?
Officer Barbrady
Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established.
Reporter 2
Do the police have any leads?
Officer Barbrady
Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet.
Reporter 3
But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime?
Officer Barbrady
All right, all right! I can't read!
The room falls silent and the reporter sits down.
Officer Barbrady
There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire!
He removes his badge and leaves the room.
Press Coordinator
Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front.
Anchor
And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while--
A note wrapped around a brick crashes onto the anchor desk and the anchor gets the note.
Anchor
This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy!
A camera pans across the rioting.
Anchor
Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town!
A man comes and takes away the symbol in the inset. Another man takes the 4.
On the street, two men use a third as a battering ram and throw him into the electronics store through the big display window. He gets up and helps the other two take the big-screen TV away. Several people have looted beer and drink as fast as they can. A red car crashes into a yellow building. Here and there people are screaming.
Looter 1
Whoopee, this is killer!
Looter 2
With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!
The boys are at a corner when someone runs by with a boom box. Kenny is closest to the corner.
Kyle
Whoa, dude, what's going on?
Stan
I don't know.
Next to Kenny, two people are trying to turn car over, and...
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed--
Kenny opens the door and steps out, dusting himself off.
Stan
Oh, never mind.
The Mayor is watching all this from her office. Automatic weapons fire is heard as a woman screams, but the street before her window is clear of any commotion.
Mayor McDaniels
I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful.
Aide 1
Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.
Mayor McDaniels
He is.
The press breaks in and rushes the Mayor's desk. More questions, but one stands out.
Reporter 3
What do you plan to do about the South Park riots?
Mayor McDaniels
No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
Reporter 3
But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do?
Mayor McDaniels
Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--
Aide 2
Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady!
Cameras snap away to South Park Elementary. There's someone new...
Mr. Garrison
Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady.
Silence. Officer Barbrady dwarfs the children as he sits among them.
Stan
I can't see, dude!
Mr. Garrison
Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics.
Officer Barbrady raises his hand.
Mr. Garrison
E-yes, what is it?
Officer Barbrady
I need to go poopies.
Mr. Garrison
[Pause.] Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class.
Officer Barbrady
Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?
Mr. Garrison
Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?
Kyle
How about a brain transplant?
Barbrady raises his eyebrows.
Mr. Garrison
Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it.
Stan struggles to see what Garrison is writing: Oprah Winfrey has huge knockers.
Mr. Garrison
Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
Ahhh... O... O--
Mr. Garrison
Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha [Slaps his thigh.] hahahaha! [Wipes his forehead.] Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones.
Mr. Garrison turns around and writes something more on the board: The hat is red.
Mr. Garrison
Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared.
Officer Barbrady
Ahhh... O...
Mr. Garrison
Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard!
Mr. Garrison starts laughing uncontrollably.
Officer Barbrady
[To the children] Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
Stan
No, we just fake it to shut him up.
Mr. Garrison
Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again.
Chicken coop. The chickens are clucking away when the door creaks open. A silhouette appear.
Intruder
So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this?
He grabs a chicken and...Cut to South Park Elementary, back in class.
Mr. Garrison
Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports.
Cartman squirms in his seat and whispers.
Mr. Garrison
Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see...
Cartman
[In falsetto.] Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?
Mr. Garrison
Eric, why don't you go first?
Cartman
Oooaaagh.
Mr. Garrison
What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?
Cartman
I'm prepared!
Cartman gets up and walks to the chalkboard, then faces the class.
Cartman
For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
No, I can't say that I have.
Cartman
Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.
Mr. Garrison
And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!
Cartman
God-dammit!
The kids start laughing at him.
Officer Barbrady
Haa haa. Ha ha ha.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?
Officer Barbrady rises and goes to the board then faces the class.
Officer Barbrady
I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: "Big... dog..., little... dog. [Turns the page.] A red dog... on a..." Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A.
Officer Barbrady
Hooray!
Cartman
[Miffed.] Goody two-shoes.
The Playground. The camera pans across the playground. It passes the kid with the aviator cap holding a Blue Mega Man, Bebe and Clyde on the hobby elephants, the boys passing a ball among themselves, and stops at the swings. Barbrady swings between Kenny and Red.
Officer Barbrady
Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
"Whoosh!" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes

Kyle looks looks back at Barbrady.
Stan
Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
Kyle
Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
Officer Barbrady
Swingset, swingset, up and down I go...

Mayor McDaniels walks up with her aides.
Mayor McDaniels
Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?!
He quickly gets off the swing, but in so doing he stresses the set and launches Kenny...
Kenny
(Daaarrrggghh--)
Kenny flies into the brick wall at the other end of the yard.
Kenny
(-ooggghhh...)
Stan
Oh, my God! They've killed--
Kenny
(Hey.)
Stan
Oh, never mind. [Smiles.]
Mayor McDaniels
Well, how's the reading coming along?
Officer Barbrady
[Wringing his hands.] Oooh, pretty good.
Mayor McDaniels
Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night.
Kyle
Oh no!.
Officer Barbrady
Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover.
Aide 2
This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic.
Officer Barbrady
Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?
Mayor McDaniels
The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene.
She hands it to Barbrady, who looks it over.
Officer Barbrady
Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's.
Mayor McDaniels
[Throttling him.] You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!
Officer Barbrady
I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
Mayor McDaniels
Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!
She leaves with her aides. Aide 1 takes the ball from the boys and pops it.
Aide 2
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Aide 1
Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry. [They leave.]
Officer Barbrady
Oh boy, I'm in big trouble.
The boys surround him.
Officer Barbrady
I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos.
Stan
It's cool, dude. We'll help you.
Officer Barbrady
Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis.
Cartman
Really? I wanna be a cop.
Officer Barbrady
You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset.
This last idea he likes a lot.
Cartman
Do I get a nightstick?
Officer Barbrady
Sure, nightsticks for everybody!
He hands his night stick to Cartman, who smiles.
Officer Barbrady
You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case.
Cartman
10-4, sergeant! [Walks off.]
Officer Barbrady
Now, what did that clue say again?
Stan
"If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft".
Officer Barbrady
To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!
Stan, Kyle, Kenny
Hooray!
Booktastic bus. Barbrady and his new deputies enter.
Bus Driver
Good day, friends. Welcome to the magical world of reading.
Officer Barbrady
We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!
Bus Driver
Oohhh, that's a very magical book, full of wondrous--
Officer Barbrady
Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake!
The bus driver retrieves the book and hands it to Barbrady. He opens it.
Kyle
What's it say?
Officer Barbrady
It says, "Mmmuh mmmuuh..." Uh, what's this word? [Points out to Stan.]
Stan
I.
Officer Barbrady
Oh, yeah. "I... mmuh mmuh--"
Kyle
Here, give me that. [Takes the book.] "I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."
Stan
A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
Officer Barbrady
That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!
Downtown South Park. The streets are desolate, and only the sound of squeaking pedals. Suddenly, Eric pops over a low hill on his Big Wheel tricycle and goes down Main Street. The bike has been souped up with a motorcycle windshield and signal lights. He's wearing aviator sunglasses. A car passes by him.
Cartman
Ey!
Cartman activates his siren, the driver sees him in the rear view mirror and pulls over. He gets off his trike, comes to the door, and taps the driver-side window with the night stick. The driver turns and lowers the window: it's Stan's father, Randy Marsh.
Randy
Uhh, yes, Officer?
Cartman
I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
Randy
Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour.
Cartman
Step out of the car, please, sir.
Randy
Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
Cartman
[Slower.] Sir, step out of the car, please.
Randy
[Steps out.] Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
Cartman
Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!
Randy
Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy.
Cartman swings his nightstick at Randy's shins and connects.
Randy
Ow!
Cartman
Get your ass to jail!
He continues to swat him on the legs with the baton.
Randy
Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
Cartman
[Getting carried away.] Sweet.
Randy
Ooww!
Stark's Pond. A crowd is gathered at the crime scene. The chicken is fluttering about. Barbrady arrives with Stan and Kyle.
Officer Barbrady
Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!
Stan
Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
Father Maxi
Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken?
Halfy
[Mischievously.] I would. [Everyone looks at him.]
Mr. Garrison
Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs!
Halfy
Oh... yeah. [He moves away on his fists.]
Father Maxi
Have some respect for people's feelings, would you, Halfy?!
Officer Barbrady
Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue.
Kyle finds it and holds it up high in the air.
Kyle
Here! Here, I found one!
Stan
What's it say? What's it say?
Kyle
It says, "Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--" What's this word?
Stan
I dunno.
Officer Barbrady
[Taking the note.] "Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist." [Everybody cheers.] I read it! I read it all by myself! [Grins.]
Halfy
[Doing flips.] Hooray, yeah! Whoo!
South Park at night. Cartman is doing a segment for COPS.
Dispatcher 2
Five George is en route to 496 Broad Wasteland...
Cartman
Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you. [The camera checks out traffic.] Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them.
Cartman is working a street, dressed in a hot-pink dress and fishnets. A car stops.
Driver
[Winking.] Hi there, little lady.
Cartman
Well, hi there.
Cartman lowers his shades and bats his eyelids.
Cartman
Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?
Driver
Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?
Cartman
Sir, step out of the car, please.
Driver
[Stammers.] What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?
Cartman
[Displays his badge.] Sir, step out of the car.
Driver
[Stepping out.] Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!
Cartman
[Pulls out his baton.] Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.
Cartman starts beating him on the shins.
Driver
Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!
Cartman
[Exhales.] Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
Outside South Park Library. Three people walk by with looted stuff.
Looter 3
I got a TV.
Looter 4
Shh. Come on!
Inside, the camera zooms in on Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
[Reading from the book.] "Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..." Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!
Stan and Kyle arrive.
Kyle
How's it goin', dude?
Officer Barbrady
Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo.
Stan
Come on, dude, it's not that hard!
Officer Barbrady
It is, too!
Kyle
Just read the sentence.
Officer Barbrady
"Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"
Kyle
Come on, dumbass, you can do it!
Officer Barbrady
"Pet--" Wait a minute. [Recalls Garrison.]
Mr. Garrison
Conjugate the verb. Conjugate the verb.
Mr. Hat
Yes, conjugate the verb.
Officer Barbrady
Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!
Downtown. In another segment of Cartman's for COPS...
Dispatcher 3
All units, all units. Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance.
The siren goes on. Cut to Kenny's house. Cartman arrives and jumps off the bike, makes his way to the front door, and knocks. Stuart opens the door.
Cartman
Sir, could you step out of the car, please?
Stuart
We're fine, officer. [Sips his beer.]
Cartman
And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?
Stuart
Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids--
Kenny and Kevin come to view.
Kenny
(Hi, Cartman.)
Stuart
--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year.
Cartman
[To the camera.] Poor people tend to live in clusters.
Stuart
[Takes a swig of beer.] What—What did you say?
Cartman
Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a...
Mrs. McCormick
I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
Stuart
Shut up, bitch!
Cartman
Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.
Mrs. McCormick
You lazy-ass motherfucker!
Stuart
Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
Mrs. McCormick
I'll do it again!
She kicks him in the ass and continues hitting him. Kenny just laughs at the sight.
Kevin
Mom hit Dad again!
Both then continue laughing at them.
Cartman
Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!
He jumps up and knocks Mrs. McCormick down, then Stuart. He then concentrates on Stuart.
Kenny
(Goddammit, Cartman!)
Stuart
Aagh!
Dispatcher 1
All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!
Cartman
[Stops, gasps.] Chickenlover!
The petting zoo. The school kids mill among the animals.
Officer Barbrady
Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute.
The chicken blushes.
Stan
Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
Kyle
Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
Officer Barbrady
Oh, no!
Rustling is heard.
Officer Barbrady
Shhh!
They turn around. A hand reaches down and plucks the bird away.
Officer Barbrady
Keep your eyes peeled.
They turn around.
Stan
Look!
Feathers are flying out from behind a bush as the bush moves around.
Kyle
He's here!
Officer Barbrady
Grab him!
All three rush the bush, meanwhile in Downtown South Park, Cartman is racing towards the zoo.
Cartman
Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!
Reaches for a doughnut and bites into it.
The petting zoo. Barbrady is wrestling the Chickenlover as Kenny arrives. Barbrady finally gets his man. It seems to be the Booktastic bus driver, and he pulls out a pistol. As Barbrady takes it from him, it fires and hits Kenny.
Stan
[Gasps.] Oh my God, they've killed--
Kenny
[Gets up.] (Oh, it was only my jacket.)
Stan
Goddammit!
Officer Barbrady
I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!
Stan
Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
Officer Barbrady
Oh.
Kyle
Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
Officer Barbrady
Caught you red-handed!
Bus Driver
Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?
Officer Barbrady
By reading Teetle the Timid Taxidermist.
Bus Driver
You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly! [Pleased.]
Stan
What are you talking about, dude?!
Bus Driver
When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!
Kyle
So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
Bus Driver
Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate.
Stan
That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
Bus Driver
Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!
No reaction from the kids.
Bus Driver
I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.
Officer Barbrady
Well, I guess I should say "Thanks?"
Bus Driver
You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand.
Cartman
[Rushing up.] Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
Kyle
Cartman!
Cartman
I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
Kyle
Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
Cartman
A-ha!
Cartman hits him with the baton.
Bus Driver
Ow, that hurts!
Kyle
Whoa, dude!
Stan
Cartman!
Officer Barbrady picks Cartman up and takes the baton from him.
Officer Barbrady
No, no, that's not how you uphold the law! [He puts him down.]
Cartman
Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!
Barbrady
Oohhh, ohh, you've got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this: [Paf.]
Bus Driver
[Going down, squealing.] Heee--!
Barbrady
You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
Cartman looks at the driver and removes his shades.
Cartman
Ooohhhh.
Kyle
I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
Barbrady
Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job!
He spins the cylinder on his pistol.
Stan/Kyle
Hooray!
Cartman watches as Barbrady leaves the petting zoo, Stan calls out to Barbrady.
Stan
Hey! So what are you going to do now?
Barbrady
Now? [Turns around.] Well, I-ee uh... I think I'll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book.
He displays the book for a moment, then holds up his right thumb for the camera to see. The end credits begin to roll, but only the executive producer is listed. The boys watch for a moment more, then walk off to the right. The chicken just walks around pecking at the straw. A bunny hops across the yard and Bebe chases after it.
Newscast.

And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case.
Tape is shown of the parade. Confetti is flying everywhere. The South Park High School band is marching before Barbrady's car. He is in the car with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman.
Officer Barbrady
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.
Man 1
Speech! Speech!
Officer Barbrady
[Lowers his arms.] What?
Stan
They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
Officer Barbrady
Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious.
The town cheers.
Man 2
Oh, yeah!
Officer Barbrady
Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered! [More cheering.] And finally, I'd like to say that [Enunciating.] reading totally sucks ass!
Stan/Kyle
Hooray!
Officer Barbrady
Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!
Stan, Kyle
Hooray for Barbrady!
The crowd cheers again.
Kyle
Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
Cartman
Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
Stan
I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
Kyle
It's poetic justice.
Officer Barbrady
[Leaning forward.] Thanks, boys.
The end credits roll again, this time normally. When the producer is listed, Kenny is shown in a clear area behind the crowd. A tree falls, flattening him.
Kenny
(Ow!)
Blood oozes from under the tree. End credits continue, showing more scenes from the parade.

	South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey passes in front of Garrison and gets ready to speak.
Stan
[Imitating the counselor] Booooo!
Mr. Mackey
Nuh-now, who was that?
No one speaks.
Mr. Mackey
That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?
Stan
[Mimicking] I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey
Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again.
Kyle
[Following Stan's lead.] We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
The others laugh.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, okay, okay, that's fine.
Cartman
M'kay?
Mr. Mackey
M'kay. [More laughs.] Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad.
Writes "smoking" on the board.
Mr. Mackey
You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad.
Writes "alcohol" on the board.
Mr. Mackey
You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. M'kay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?
Stan's hand is up.
Mr. Mackey
Yes, Stan?
Stan
Why do dogs have cold noses?
Mr. Mackey
Uhhh, well, I'm not sure.
Stan
Oh.
Mr. Mackey
Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana.
Writes "marijuana" on the board.
Mr. Mackey
Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,
Pip takes the Petri dish with the marijuana leaf in it and just looks at it. The others look at him.
Mr. Mackey
...so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,
Pip sniffs at it, then passes it back to Bill.
Mr. Mackey
...and when it gets back up to me,
Bill sniffs at it.
Mr. Mackey
...we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you...
Kyle
Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?
Stan
Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
Kyle
No, it's his bris.
Cartman
What the hell is a "bris"?
Kyle
I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
Cartman
Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!
Mr. Mackey
...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?
No answer from the class.
Mr. Mackey
No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.
Mr. Mackey writes "LSD" on the board.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney...
Stan
Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?
Kyle
Uhhh... I'm not sure.
Stan
Well, dude, you better find out!
Mr. Mackey
Boys, are you paying attention?
Stan
Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey
Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?
No response.
Mr. Mackey
Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?
Stan blinks.
Mr. Mackey
Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?
Not a thing.
Mr. Mackey
Uh-oh.
Principal Victoria's office.
Principal Victoria
I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? [Thumps the desk.]
Mr. Mackey
I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria.
Principal Victoria
We-hell, "sorry" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school.
Mr. Mackey
You mean I'm fired?
Principal Victoria
Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes.
Mr. Mackey
But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--
Principal Victoria
It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.
Mr. Mackey
But--
Principal Victoria
We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!
Mr. Mackey
Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-[Sniff.]m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??
Principal Victoria
There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff.
Mr. Mackey
[Sobbing.] No-uho-uho-uho! [Sniff.] Not o-uho-uhokay!
Bus stop. The kids leave the bus and Mrs. Crabtree peels away screaming.
Stan
Man! That sucked, getting searched.
They walk off together.
Cartman
Yeah, my ass is killing me.
Kyle
Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
Cartman
I wonder who took it.
Mr. Garrison's house. He's looking drowsy watching Teletubbies'
Announcer
And now it's almost time for BoBo's.
The Teletubbies move around whirring all the while. Garrison laughs softly.
The boys are walking home when Chef drives up to them.
Chef
Hello there, children.
Boys
Hey, Chef.
Kyle
How's it going?
Chef
Bad.
Kyle
Why bad?
Chef
Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?
Stan
No, dude, we never even saw it!
Chef
Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
Stan
We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
Chef
Right. But do you know why they're bad?
Kyle
Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
Chef
And do you have any idea what that means?
Kyle
No.
Cartman
I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
Chef
Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?
Boys
Dude!
Chef
Okay. [Starts to move.]
Kyle
Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
Chef
[Stops.] Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!
Stan
What do ya mean?
Chef
Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
Cartman
Wo-what's that?
Chef
Oh boy. Here we go again.
The boys wait.
Chef
Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
Stan
Ahhh, bicycles?
Cartman
Ham?
Kyle
No, not ham, you fat fuck!
Cartman
Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?
Chef
No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body.
Kyle
Your heart?
Stan
Your eyes?
Chef slaps his hand to his forehead in disbelief.
Kenny
(Ooh, the penis!)
Chef
That's right.
Cartman
Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
Chef
A "fireman"?
Cartman
That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.
Chef
Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?
Chef starts up his car. The radio comes on.
Chef
Ask your parents for once!
Kyle
Hey, wait!
Chef drives away.
Stan
Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good.
Mr. Mackey is walking the streets of South Park, quite depressed. A car pulls up and the driver honks twice. Mr. Mackey looks to see who it is.
Female passenger
Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My four-year-old needs a fix! Yehahahahaha!
They drive off. Bill Allen's father pulls up in a small truck.
Mr. Allen
Hey, Mackey! Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common, d'oh-pe! [Peels away.] Ha ha ha ha!
Mr. Mackey resumes his sorrowful walk. A blue car pulls up.
Driver 2
Heeey, Mackey!
Driver 3
Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross the road?
Driver 3's Passenger
Who do you think you are, you stupid drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies are all alike!
Driver 4
Won't you leave the guy alone?
Traffic is building up. Horns blow.
Driver 5
Hey, hippie, are you gonna do some drugs?
Mr. Mackey
Uuuuuugh!
Quickly drops into a bar and takes a seat.
Bartender
Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before.
Mr. Mackey
Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job.
Bartender
Oh that's weak, man. You know what you need? You need a good, stiff drink.
Mr. Mackey
Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?
Bartender
Trust me, man! It'll make you feel better.
Places the mug before him.
Mr. Mackey
Ughuh... [To himself.] Drinkin's bad.
Devil
[Poof.] Go ahead. Drink the beer. It'll calm you down.
Angel
[Poof.] Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a beer. Don't be such a pussy, m'kay?
Mackey takes the beer and drinks most of it.
Poof. The angel and devil are gone.
Bartender
So how do you feel?
Mr. Mackey
[Burp] Woah, about the same.
Bartender
Oh, you just need something a little stronger.
Serves up some Scotch whiskey.
The boys minus Stan are at the curb working on an ice sculpture of South Park.
Stan
[Rushing up.] Kyle! You have to stop them!
Kyle
Stop who?
Stan
Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
Kyle
What?
Stan
They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
Kyle's jaw drops. For a moment he's dumbstruck.
Kyle
Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
Stan
Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
Cartman
Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
Kyle
That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
Stan
Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
Cartman
Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!
Kyle
I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad!
He leaves for home. The others follow.
Mr. Mackey is walking down the street, drunk, singing Pat Benatar's "Love is a Battlefield"
Mr Mackey
We are young, m'kay?
Heartache to heartache we stand, m'kay?
No promises, no demands, m-m'kay..?

Mr. Mackey approaches front door of his house; he places his key into the lock but fails to fit.
Mr. Mackey
Whoa... Is this my house?
Landlord
[Smoking a cigar.] Your key ain't gonna work, Mackey! I changed the locks!
Mr. Mackey
Why, Mr. Freely?
Mr. Freely
I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard that you got fired from your job for selling drugs to children!
Mr. Mackey
No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that.
Mr. Freely
Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having never taken drugs, I can say that they have nothing to offer!
Mr. Mackey
But I've never taken drugs either.
Mr. Freely
I've never taken drugs, and look at me! I'm totally fine! Now get off my property before I lose control and kill you!
Mr. Freely takes out his cigar and throws it away.
Mr. Mackey
Huuhh?
Freeley throws a rock at Mackey, which strikes him on the left side of the head, and Mackey falls.
Mr. Mackey
Ow, m'kay?!
Mr. Freely
Drug user! Druuug user!
Mr. Mackey
[Struggles to get up.] Uh, uh--
Mr. Mackey tries to dodge the rocks Freeley is chucking at him.
Mr. Freely
Come back here, dammit!
Mr. Mackey
Whoa, wait!
Mr. Mackey ends up running away, meanwhile at Kyle's home. Decorations for the bris are going up.
Sheila
Just a little higher.
The boys arrive.
Kyle
Mom! Dad!
Sheila
Oh, hi, bubele. I'm glad you're here; you can help decorate for the party.
Gerald
Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
Cartman
What the hell is gahekgafuga?
Kyle
Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?
Sheila
To celebrate your little brother's [Ike claps.] passage into life.
Kyle
Meaning what?
Gerald
Meaning we're going to circumcise him. [Kyle gasps.]
Cartman
They are gonna cut off his fireman!
Sheila
It's Jewish tradition, bubbe.
Gerald
Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--
Kyle
AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!
Kyle rushes into his room. The boys stare at Kyle's parents agape with their jaws dropped for a moment.
Gerald
Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him?
Stan is stiff. In his vision, the parents become dæmons with Gerald holding shears.
Sheila, Gerald
Let us cut off you pee pee, Stan!
Stan, Cartman
AAAAGGGGHHHH!!!! Aaagg-that's the sickest friggin' thing-run, ruuun!
Kenny pulls his hood closed.
Kenny
(Run, dude!)
All three run into Kyle's room.
Sheila
Oy, what is the matter with them?
Kyle's bedroom.
Kyle
I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
Stan
What are you goin' to do, dude?
Kyle
I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!
He jumps out the window.
Kyle
Come on, Ike!
Ike jumps off and into Kyle's arms.
Kyle
Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
Cartman
No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
Kyle
Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike!
Cartman and Stan look at each other, scared.
A dark alley. Mr. Mackey is sleeping under some pages from a newspaper.
Mr. Mackey
Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?
Hobo
Hey, you want somethin' to warm you up?
Mr. Mackey
[Startled.] Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken.
Hobo
[Holds out a joint.] Here, try this; it'll warm you up.
Mr. Mackey
Marijuwana's bad.
Hobo
What?
Mr. Mackey
Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay?
Hobo
And you don't fell that way now?
Mr. Mackey
Oh, good point.
Mr. Mackey takes the joint and inhales it deeply, then holds his breath a bit, then relaxes.
Mr. Mackey
No, I don't feel any d-oooohh...
Psychedelic music plays in the background.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, baby, get down, m'kay?
Hobo
Uh-huh.
The alley brightens up and takes on neon hues.
Mr. Mackey
Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful! [He drops the joint.]
Hobo
Ohh, boy.
Meanwhile, at the South Park Train Station.
Kyle
Come on, Ike, hurry up! [Ike babbles.] Where is the next train going?
Clerk
Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes.
Kyle
You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?
Ike
No!
Kyle
I need one ticket for my little brother.
Clerk
That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
Kyle
Huh?
Clerk
I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train.
Kyle
But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
Clerk
What?! Why the hell would they do that?
Kyle
They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
Clerk
No can do, sonny.
Kyle
Dammit!
Kyle walks away with Ike to the train and spots an open door from a freight car. The departing bells sound.
Kyle
Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train.
The train whistle blow and starts to pull away.
Kyle
Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
Ike
Don't kick the--
Kyle kick him into the car.
Kyle
Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
Ike
Bye-bye.
Some woods near the town, daytime. Mr. Mackey is dazed and confused. A Seinfeld-esque riff plays.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, man, where am I?
Teen 1
Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary school, Mr. Mackey.
Teen 2
Wow, dude.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, hi, boys, how are you today?
Teen 1
Pretty good, man. How are you?
Mr. Mackey
Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs.
Teen 1
Hey! Us, too!
Teen 2
Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking weed in the bathroom and got us suspended.
Mr. Mackey
Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?
Teen 1
Oh, cheer up, bro; all you need is some clear liquid to get your head straight.
Mr. Mackey
Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm...
He opens the bottle and lets a drop go into his mouth. The boys watch. Mackey's voice becomes distorted.
Mr. Mackey
Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?
Psychedelic music begins to play as his head inflates.
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, baby... The world is so small.
His head pops off his body and floats away.
Mr. Mackey
I'm free... I'm free...
Teen 2
Sweet dude, totally killer.
Teen 1
That guy's totally trippin'.
Mr. Mackey's head floats on, smiling.
Bus Stop. Kyle has met the boys there and is working on a doll.
Kyle
There, what do you think?
Cartman
What the hell is that supposed to be?
Kyle
I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
Stan
Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike.
Kyle
Not when if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.
Sylvester runs up, having smelled the doll's contents.
Kyle
No, go away! Bad dog!
Stan
Dude, what did you make that doll out of?
Kyle
I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
Cartman
Is that why it stinks so bad?
Mackey's head flies past.
Mr. Mackey
Hi, boys.
Boys
Hi, Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey
Are you boys stayin' out of trouble?
Boys
Yes.
Mr. Mackey
Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while.
Mr. Mackey's head floats away.
Kyle
Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.
Sylvester returns, growling as he sniffs the doll.
Kyle
Knock it off, asshole!
Cartman
No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
Stan
Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you.
Stan, Kyle, and Kenny leave.
Cartman
Eech.
Starts to walk, but then stops.
Cartman
Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!
Train Station. The train comes to a stop. A door opens, and Ike is booted out.
Ike
Oh.
Ike lands on his head, then flips upright.
Ike
Oooh.
A couple stops by.
Woman
Oh, would you look at that, honey? Somebody dropped off a perfectly good trash can. [The couple leaves.]
Ike
Yeah. No more walbolching!
Ike skips away into the corn fields nearby.
Kyle's house. The boys return from the bus stop.
Sheila
Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes.
Kyle
Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky.
Kyle rustles the doll a bit.
Sheila
How is my little jellybean?
Kyle
[Doing Ike.] Bye-bye seeme mama. [As himself.] Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up.
Sylvester has found the house, and is seen looking from behind two pine trees.
Sheila
Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss.
The boys flinch.
Kyle
No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him.
Sheila withdraws as Sylvester leaps in and eats the doll from Kyle's hands.
Sheila
Aaaaargh! Omigod, make him stop!
Gerald
AAAGGGHH!!!
Kyle
Put him down, you stupid dog!
Sheila
My baby! Oh, God, the horror!
Sylvester is chewing the doll's head to pieces.
Gerald
Get out of here, you mutt! Let him go!
He moves to chase Sylvester away. Sylvester bites into the doll and runs off with it. The boys can only stand with jaws dropped.
Sheila
[Frantically.] Ooooohhhhhhooh-ho! Oooh, my baby! Bubbeleh mine!
All of them gather at the front porch. Sylvester is munching away on the doll in the middle of the street.
Shiela
Waagghh!!
A truck driver is sleepily driving down the road, but he does see Sylvester.
Shiela
My baby!!
Driver
Huuh?
Steps on the brakes, but hits the dog.
Gerald, Sheila
Aaaggghhh! Aaagh aaagghh!
The gas tank behind the cab cracks open like an egg, then explodes, killing the driver and Sylvester.
Sheila
[Tearful.] Oh, he's dead, he's dead! My little bubbeleh's dead!
Gerald
There, there, Shei-hla. There's nothing we can do.
Stan and Cartman look at Kyle, who puts his hands behind his back. Cartman's mad at him.
Cemetery. Ike's casket is being lowered into the plot. Present at the funeral are the Marshes and the Broflovskis, Jimbo, Ned, Barbrady, a piper, and the priest, with a kippah on his head and a scarf on his shoulders.
Father Maxi
"Yea, usher us unto the Lord", sayeth some Jewish guy once. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
He throws some ashes into the grave. As the piper plays Hava Nagila, everyone covers their ears. They go their separate ways.
Kyle
Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
Headstone reads: "Ike Moisha Broflovski 1996-1998, Born a Canadian, died an American".
Sheila
Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted.
Kyle
What??
Gerald
He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. [He starts to sob]
Kyle
You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
Sheila
What are you talking about?
Kyle
Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!
The boys turn right and walk away.
Sheila
What-what-whaaat?!
Stan
Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
Cartman
Fireman!
Kyle
Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility.
Kenny falls into an open grave.
Kenny
(Hey!)
The spiked tombstone falls in.
Kenny
(Hey, you guys! I'm dy--)
The tombstone hits its mark. The grave is deep. Stan hears the impact and turns.
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle
[Flatly] You bastards!
Kyle keeps walking. The crowds reconvenes, this time for Kenny's funeral.
Father Maxi
[Removes kippah and scarf.] "Yea, let us ponder the Lord's mercy. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
The piper plays Hava Nagila again.
Somewhere in South Park, after the funeral. Jimbo and Ned pass Mackey on the sidewalk. Mackey's eyes are bloodshot. Jimbo and Mackey bump shoulders.
Jimbo
Get outta the way, you damn hippie!
Mr. Mackey
[Annoyed] I don't need to take you right-wing authoritative bullshit!
Jimbo
What?
Mr. Mackey
Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?
Jimbo
Aw, why don't you go to a Grateful Dead concert? [He and Ned leave]
Mr. Mackey
I can't, man. Jerry Bear's dead, m'kay?
Blonde
He-e-ey, man, I overheard what you said; that was coool!
Mr. Mackey
What? Oh, thanks, man.
Blonde
Would you like to come over to my place and finger-paint?
Mr. Mackey
[Getting mellow.] Sure, man. Finger-paintin's cool, m'kay?
They walk off together. Lincoln, Nebraska, train station. The Broflovskis get off the train, Kyle first.
Sheila
Now, where did you leave him, young man?
Kyle
Aw, how the hell should I know?
Sheila
Gerald! Do something about your smart-ass son!
Gerald
Uhhh... Mind your... mother, smart-ass.
Sheila
If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!
Gerald peeks into a trashcan.
Shiela
Ike, love?
Kyle
[Grousing.] All the time: "Look out for your little brother, Kyle!", "Take care of your little brother, Kyle", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
Gerald
Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother.
Kyle
Yeah, right.
Sheila puts down a bench she was looking under as a clerk approaches.
Sheila
Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy.
Clerk
Two-year-old Canadian boy, two-year-old Canadian boy... Oh, I think they might have one of those down at Haps Bar.
Sheila
[Gasps.] Come on!
Haps Bar. The Broflovskis enter and scan the room, Ike is being used as a base at one table. The camera pans back to him. Sheila rushes over to him and throws the table top off to get him.
Sheila
Ike!
Ike
Mamatoedoe.
Barkeep
Hey, lady, that's my table post! You can't have that!
Mr. Mackey and the blonde are in bed admiring the finger-painting they have done all over the room, including the ceiling.
Mackey
Wow, man. You know, it's like… You go through life thinking that you're an individual, m'kay? And then you realize that you're more than that, m'kay. We're all just one big individual, m'kay?
Blonde
Let's get married and have a honeymoon in India.
Mackey
[Gives it some thought.] M'kay.
Mr. Mackey removes his tie and his head deflates to a normal state.
Kyle's house.
Gerald
Now you march to your room, and you think about what you've done!
Sheila
But first, apologize to your brother!
Kyle
[Pointing at Ike.] He's not my brother!
Gerald
Apologize to him!
Kyle
[Angrily.] I'm sorry, Ike.
Kyle turns around and walks off.
Ike
Uh oh, stufid.
Kyle goes into his room and closes the door. Ike is saddened.
Somewhere in India, Mackey and the blonde are hiking. Elephants bathe in the river below them.
Blonde
Wooow, this is sooo beautiful!
Mackey
[A dove alights on his right arm.] I am one with the animals. And the trees.
Blonde
And I am one with you. [They reach for each other.]
Mr. Mackey
At long last I have found
A true reason to be
Now I feel I can start anew--

Mr. T flies onto him and pins him. Hannibal and Face come and pick him up, then all three rough him up.
Mr. Mackey
Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey!
They carry him away.
Mr. Mackey
Uh oh hel-m. Hey!
Blonde
[Subdued.] Whoa...
Mackey
[As Mr. T tosses him into the A-Team van.] Yeah I got, m'kay?
Inside the van. Jimbo is driving, with Ned sitting next to him. Mr. Mackey sits between Mr, T and Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Mackey
Uh-- What the hell is going on?!
Jimbo
Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab.
Mr. Mackey
I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
Principal Victoria
We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need.
Mr. Mackey
I don't want help!
Principal Victoria
You'll thank us later.
They drive off into the distance. Meanwhile at Kyle's House, the big day is here. Guests are arriving.
Sheila
Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris.
Ike
Uh oh.
Sheila
Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray!
Uncle Murray
Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?
Sheila
He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted.
Uncle Murray moves off.
Guest
Hi there!
Sheila
Hello. Do I know you?
Guest
Uh-no, but I never miss a bris. Here, I brought some dip. [Gives it to her.]
Sheila
Ohhh, thanks.
Kyle's room. The boys are gathered there.
Cartman
Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
Ike enters the room with a photo album.
Ike
Oh deh family nrr.
Kyle
What do you want?!
Ike
I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr.
He opens the album, which reveals pictures of Kyle and Ike. Tender music plays. Kyle looks. The first one has Kyle holding Ike, while the second one has Ike riding on Kyle's elephant.
Kyle
Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
Stan
Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
Kyle
No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
Ike pulls the album down a bit.
Ike
Cookie Monster, [flips some pages] two, three, four, five.
The third one: Kyle and Ike tossing a football. The fourth one: a family portrait. The fifth one: Kyle, with Ike in his walker. The sixth one: Kyle giving Ike a bath.
Kyle
Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!
Ike
[Now sporting one of Kyle's caps.] Baraterndr nfard fy. [Kyle looks. Pause.]
Betty Ford Clinic. Inside...
Social Worker
You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you.
Mr. Mackey
But I don't think I really have a problem.
Social Worker
Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family.
Mr. Mackey
I don't really have a family.
Social Worker
And you lost your job.
Mr. Mackey
No, I lost my job before that.
Social Worker
Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult.
Nearby, the two teens are on a sofa watching the Teletubbies.
Social Worker
The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad.
Mr. Mackey
Drugs are baad.
Social Worker
Drugs are bad.
Mr. Mackey
Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad.
More guests arrive for Ike's bris. Ding-dong.
Sheila
Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris.
Dr. Schwartz
Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one.
The incisive hole is maple leaf-shaped.
Where is the little rug rat?
Dialog
Sheila
Right over here.
She takes him over to Ike.
Dr. Schwartz
Come 'ere, you.
Ike
Oowwww!
Ike skips away into Kyle's room.
Ike
Oh deh faminrr.
Ike hops over to Kyle. They look at each other as the doctor calls.
Dr. Schwartz
Ike? Ike?
Ike jumps up and hugs Kyle.
Ike
Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr.
Ike hugs him tighter, and Kyle is moved.
Dr. Schwartz
There you are. Come on Ike, it's time.
Kyle recovers and gets angry.
Kyle
You stay away from my little brother!
Dr. Schwartz
[Stammers.] Bu-bu-but, son, I just--
Kyle
You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
Sheila
[Now in the room.] Kyle, what are you talking about?
Kyle
And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
Cartman
[A bit solemnly.] Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye. [Stan draws a blank.]
Dr. Schwartz
Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and...
Dr. Schwartz points at Kyle.
Dr. Schwartsz
...his brother had it.
Cartman and Stan gape.
Kyle
No! No, it isn't true!
Dr. Schwartz
We're not going to cut it off! We're just goin' to snip it, so it looks bigger.
Stan and Cartman wonder.
Dialog
Stan
Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
Cartman
Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. [Kyle looks up.]
Betty Ford Clinic. Mr. Mackey and the social worker exit the main building.
Social Worker
Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered.
Mr. Mackey
I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again.
Social Worker
Just one more thing.
She sets his tie in place, and his head inflates to its original state.
Social Worker
Remember that you can stay sober.
Mr. Mackey
I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will. [They embrace one last time.] M'kay?
Kyle's house. Everyone is gathered for the bris.
Kyle
It's okay, Ike. I'm here.
Dr. Schwartz
And-a one and-a two and-a... bris. [Snip.]
Ike
Ouch. Amuhbuhbuhbuh.
The boys faint. The adults clap. He skips over to Kyle.
Ike
Cookie Monster.
Kyle
[Gets up.] Ike, you're okay. [Cartman and Stan get up.]
Stan
Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
Kyle
Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family. [Tugs on Ike and moves away.] Except for Cartman.
Stan
[Follows.] Naturally.
Cartman
Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!
Monday morning, Mr. Garrison's class.
Mr. Garrison
And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol.
Mr. Garrison makes way for Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey
Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life...
Mr. Garrison slowly shakes his head.
Cartman
Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?
Stan
You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
Cartman
No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
Mr. Mackey
Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?
Stan
[Mimicking.] Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?
Mr. Mackey
M'kay.
Kyle
M'kay?
Mr. Mackey
M'kay.
Cartman
Okay?
Mr. Mackey
Okay.
The camera slowly pulls away.
Mr. Mackey
Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?

	South Park Elementary Gym.
Chef
Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball!
The class groans.
Kyle
We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
Stan
Yeah.
Chef
So let's have half the children on this side [To his right.] and half the children on that side. [To his left]
Team 1 walks to one side. The children groan.
Pip
[Uncertain.] Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball.
Cartman
[With Clyde and Stan looking on.] What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
Pip
Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--
Stan
Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball.
Pip
Oh, dear.
Stan
If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins.
Pip
Oh, what jolly good fun!
Kyle
No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school.
The teams are as follows:
Team 1: Kyle, Clyde, Kenny, Stan, Cartman, Pip, Jordan, Swanson, and the boy with the blue cap
Team 2: Bill, Fosse, Kevin, Bebe, Red, and Terrance.
Chef
[Blows his whistle.] Play ball!
Kevin takes the ball and chucks it at Stan's team. It hits Clyde.
Clyde
Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!
Stan
Dammit, we lost one already!
Chef
Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh.
Stan
Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup.
Jordan and Swanson pull forward as told to. Kevin throws again, and it hits Jordan, causing her to scream and be knocked out.
Stan
We're losing men fast out here!
He and Kyle jump out of the way as the ball sails towards the boy with the blue cap. The boy falls and lets out a grunt of pain. The ball returns to the opposing team.
Chef
[Giggling.] Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall!
Kevin serves again, and Kyle looks away as it comes towards him, amazingly Kyle opens his eyes to find the ball is in his hands.
Kyle
I caught it! I caught it!
Chef
Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!
Kyle
Here, Pip, you throw.
Kyle tosses the ball to Pip, who catches it.
Pip
Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't.
Kyle
Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
Pip
I'm not French--
Kyle
Throw the ball, you stupid frog!
Pip sets up to throw.
Kyle
God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,
Angered, Pip throws the ball at him.
Kyle
you'd be able to-- Ow! [He falls.].
Chef
Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team.
Kyle
Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
Cartman
Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.
Pip
Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!
Chef
That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office.
Fear strikes the kids.
Kyle
[Gasp.] No. No, it'll be okay!
Chef
Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on.
Chef takes him by the hand, and leads him away to the nurse's office.
Kyle
Oh-- Noooo!
Cartman
[Ominously.] Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
Clyde
I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
Bebe
I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
Cartman
Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?
Stan
[Somberly.] No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.
Nurse's Office. Kyle's shadow is on the window. He waits with his hand on his nose. He sees a mouse nibble at some cheese and run away. He looks up, and a door opens. Kyle looks and shuts his eyes tight.
Nurse Gollum
Are you Kyle Broflovski?
She sounds friendly, but her shadow falls on him.
Kyle
Ye-yes.
Nurse Gollum
I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
Kyle
Ye-yes.
Nurse Gollum
Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you.
Kyle
I know.
Nurse Gollum
So open them.
She walks to her left, Kyle resists, then opens them.
Kyle
Oh! Phew.
Nurse Gollum
Now, what seems to be the problem?
Kyle
Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
Nurse Gollum
Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack.
She turns to face him, and a withered fetus comes into view. It is joined to her left temple and upper cheek.
Kyle
AAGGGGGHHHH!!
Nurse Gollum
What?
Kyle
OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
Nurse Gollum
Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head.
Kyle
AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
After school, at Kyle's house. The boys are there to listen to Kyle's story.
Kyle
...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
Boys
Eewwww!
Cartman
Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
Kyle
No. No-it looked dead.
Boys
Eewwww!
Stan
Wa-was it wearing clothes?
Kyle
Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
Stan
Oh, yeah. Eeww.
Boys
Eewwww!
Kyle
And then she walked over to--
Sheila
Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called "conjoined twin myslexia".
Cartman
Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me...
Sheila
Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys.
They hop on the sofa. She sits in the middle and opens the book. Softly, she reads.
Sheila
You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins.
A picture of two adults attached by the side of the head is shown.
The Boys
Gross!
Sheila
But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached.
Stan is frightened.
Sheila
Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it!
Now, Cartman is frightened. He and Stan rush out of there.
Stan
AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
Cartman
AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
Sheila
So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?
Kyle
Uhhhh... Yeah.
She leaves, and Kyle's eyes follow her. Then he looks forward, then at Kenny. Kenny cracks up.
The dining room. Sheila serves dinner to Gerald as he reads the newspaper.
Sheila
Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?
Gerald
Mm-hmm.
Sheila
Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day...
Gerald
Mm-hmm.
The phone rings and Sheila answers.
Sheila
Hello?
Sharon
Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother.
Stan is screaming and running around the house.
Sheila
Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon.
Sharon
Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?
Randy chases him down.
Stan
No! I have to get it out!
Sheila
Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia.
Sharon
So this is your fault.
Stan
ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
Randy
Damn it, stop.
Stan slips from his grasp and he falls.
Randy
Oh!
Gets up and chases him.
Randy
Damn it!
Sharon
Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead?
Click. Stan runs by again, still screaming and pursued by Randy. Sheila is left with a dial tone.
Sheila
[Undaunted.] That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
Gerald
Mm-hmm.
South Park Elementary Gym.
Stan
[To Cartman.] Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?
Cartman
Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
Chef
[Arriving with a letter.] Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
All
Awww...
Stan
Aw, do we have to?
Kyle
Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
Chef
You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!
Cartman
Heyh! They have a zoo there!
Chef
That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!
The class separates into teams.
Stan
Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
Kyle
Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
Pip
I'd love to!
Cartman
Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.
Pip
Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.
He turns and walks away.
Pip
And besides, I hate French people.
Chef blows the whistle to begin play. Fosse throws, and Bebe is beaned. The foursome look at her, then laugh while Pip observes.
Principal Victoria's office. She's meeting with Mr. Mackey and Sheila.
Principal Victoria
Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?
Sheila
Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
Principal Victoria
O-of course you do.
Sheila
I want to talk to you all about your school nurse.
Principal Victoria and Mackey are surprised.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--
Sheila
No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of.
Principal Victoria
Oh, and uh, what disease is that?
Mr. Mackey
Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia.
Principal Victoria
What's that?
Sheila
She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
Principal Victoria
[Gasp.] She does?
Mr. Mackey
Y-you never noticed that?
Principal Victoria
No-o, I never did.
Sheila
Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!
Principal Victoria
Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?
Sheila
I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
Mr. Mackey
Do we have to eat kosher stuff?
Principal Victoria
Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8:00?
Sheila
Wonderful!
Principal Victoria
Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?
A mountain road. The class is on its way to the State Finals.
Chef
[Rising.] Okay children. [Encouraging] Now, who's gonna win the State Finals?
The kids just look at him.
Clyde
Denver?
Chef
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!

The kids just look at him. He looks back, then turns to Ms. Crabtree.
Chef
I think we need to get off on this exit.
Mrs. Crabtre
SIT DOWN, KID!!
Chef
But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
Ms. Crabtree
DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!
Chef
How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!
Ms. Crabtree
I SAID SIT DOOWWN!!!
Chef
[Sits down.] Yes, ma'am.
The kids arrive at Denver Elementary.
Stan
Whoa, dude, this is a school?
The crowd is cheering. Cows fans are scattered among the crowd.
Bob Thomas
Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars.
He slaps Chef on the back.
Chef
I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows.
Bob Thomas
Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are.
Chef is pissed.
Bob Thomas
You're from South Park, yeah?
Chef
[In a low tone.] Yeah.
Bob Thomas
My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful.
He slaps Chef on the back again and leaves. Chef wonders, then gets mad again as the whistle blows.
Referee
Play ball!
Dinner at the Broflovski house. Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, and Nurse Gollum are there, with her conjoined fetus out of view.
Sheila
So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?
Nurse Gollum
Colorado State.
Sheila
Ahhh.
Principal Victoria
Oh.
They resume eating in silence.
Gerald
Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?
Sheila looks at Nurse Gollum, then glares at Gerald.
Gerald
I mean, gravy.
Sheila kicks him on the shins.
Gerald
Ow!
Denver Elementary. The Cougars are serving. Player 1 throws the ball, and it hits Token, who goes down.
Token Black
Ow!
The Cougar fans cheer.
Chef
Dammit, come on!
Clyde, Swanson, and Kevin are already out.
Chef
Somebody catch the ball!
Only Pip and the Boys remain.
Bob Thomas
All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go!
Player 1 serves again, and the ball hits Cartman in the belly where it gets stuck.
Cartman
I caught it, I caught it!
Player 1
Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly!
Referee 2
South Park on offense!
Chef
Great job, children! Just stay focused now.
Kyle
Go for it, Pip.
Kyle tosses the ball over to Pip.
Pip
Oh, bother.
Kyle
Come on, you Frenchy little frog!
Pip
Gagghh!
Pip hurls the ball at the other team and knocks down players 1 and 13.
Chef
Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!
Back at Broflovski's.
Principal Victoria
Eh, sooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight.
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?
Gerald
Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!
Sheila
Gerald!
Sheila smacks him off his chair.
Shiela
Keep your damn mouth shut!
Nurse Gollum
I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really.
Sheila
[Exhales.] Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum.
Nurse Gollum
No, I'm quite secure with it.
Sheila
I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
Nurse Gollum
They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
Mr. Mackey
Could I get some more pork?
Principal Victoria
So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?
Nurse Gollum
Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death.
Principal Victoria
Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?
Nurse Gollum
No, really, I don't need a--
Sheila
Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop.
Nurse Gollum
I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person.
Sheila
I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
Principal Victoria
Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring.
Nurse Gollum
But I really don't think--
Mr. Mackey
Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?
Sheila
Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now!
Sheila leaves with Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria. Nurse Gollum and Gerald look at each other. Gerald winces.
Meanwhile at the Dodgeball State Finals.
Chef
You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions.
Cartman
Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap.
Pip gets pissed and winds up.
Kyle
Get him, Frenchy!
Pip
Gaagghh!
Pip hurls the ball across the court where it hits player 6 on the nose. The player goes down.
Referee 2
South Park wins!
Coach Thomas is in utter disbelief as the victory music plays.
Chef
We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!
Player 6
Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee!
A group of parents looks on as an injured player on the opposing team writhes on the floor in pain.
Player 6
It hur-hurts! Owieee!
Two clowns come out with a stretcher and place it next to him.
Player 6
Mommy, it huurts! I-it hur-hurts!
The clowns do a little jig, and the parents laugh. The clowns place him on the other side of the stretcher, then pick up the stretcher and walk away. The boy is left on the floor. The parents applaud.
Chef
Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!
Oooh, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red

Chef dances, and shows off his butt several times. He also turns to make sure Coach Thomas is watching.
Meanwhile, at the South Park Town Square.
Mayor McDaniels
Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals...
The crowd cheers wildly.
Mayor McDaniels
...where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.
The Broflovskis are not amused. The crowd quiets down.
Mayor McDaniels
But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!
The crowd cheer louder.
Mayor McDaniels
And now, let's kick off our week long festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!
More cheering. There are people on rooftops all over the square cheering as well.
Mayor McDaniels
Let's hear it for these brave souls!
The band starts playing festive music. The crowd cheers up and down as Nurse Gollum walks down the street, alone. She looks around and waves.
Mayor McDaniels
What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!
Nine men are shown, and they cheer back. Nurse Gollum is now next to Mayor McDaniels at the podium.
Nurse Gollum
You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job.
Mayor McDaniels
[The mic is still on.] Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
Somewhere near Washington, D.C. The bus is going through a lovely meadow.
Chef
How much further is Washington, D.C.?
Mrs. Crabtree
SIT DOWN, KID!!
Chef
I need to know how far it is, lady!
Mrs. Crabtree
I SAID SIT DOWN!!!
Chef
[Grumbling.] Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog.
Mrs. Crabtree
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
Chef
I said, "I've always wanted to visit Prague."
Mrs. Crabtree
Oh, me too.
Clyde munches away.
Stan
[To Kyle.] Okay, what have you got?
Kyle
Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
Cartman
[Quickly.] I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll!
Kenny pulls out a bone.
Stan
Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!
Stan takes one end of a short bungee cord while Cartman holds the other end.
Stan
Places!
Stan gives his end to Kyle and takes the jelly roll. He places the jelly roll in the makeshift slingshot, pulls back, and fires away. All three smile as the roll flies forward. It hits Mrs. Crabtree on the back of her head.
Ms. Crabtree
ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!
She loses control of the bus as it careens down the road.
Kids
Whoa!
Kenny
(Sheesh!)
A tourist sees the bus coming his way and tries to get out of the way, but the bus crashes into the Vietnam Memorial's right wall, and the engine bursts into flames. He was thrown to one side. The right wall drops down three feet, taking the front end of the bus with it and raising the back of the bus off the ground five feet. Both front doors fall off.
Ulysses Grant Elementary. Inside, the gym is filled with championship banners going back to 1987 hang from the rafters. Posters line the walls.
Chef
Damn, man. This is the big time, alright.
Stan
Chef, we're hungry.
Chef
You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese.
Cartman
My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
Chef
What?
Referee
Are you Chef?
Chef
Yeah.
Referee
The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions.
Chef
What? We did it! Children, we won!
Kyle
Wow, that was easy.
Announcer
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows!
Everyone boos as Kyle rushes over to the opposing team.
Kyle
Hey, why did you guys forfeit?
Player
You mean you don't know?
Kyle
Know what?
Player
Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.
A temple scene comes up. A squad of Chinese kids are exercising as their master gives orders. Some of them are being acrobatic, others throw solid kettle-bells at each other.
Master
Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia!
Player
[Voice-over.] They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals.
Each kid is handed a bowling ball, which he or she throws against a brick wall. The wall crumbles further with every throw. The scene fades, and the foursome are standing there, awed.
Player
Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about.
He hops off and leaves as Chef comes over.
Chef
Okay, children, back in the bus.
South Park City Hall. Many people are seated at table waiting for the evening's events to unfold.
Mayor McDaniels
And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison.
He starts up the player. He's in a nice tuxedo. Nurse Gollum is quite embarrassed as she sits with Sharon in the crowd.
Nurse Gollum
Oh, no..!
Singer
[The video begins.]
You've got the strength, you've got the courage
Even with a dead fetus on your head
You carry on
You fight for tomorrow
Dead fetus or no, you never let go
You're my conjoined-twin-dead-thing-hanging-off-your-head woman

Scenes from the video:
She's painting her house orange, and annoyed that Garrison is filming it.
She looks out the window, and is annoyed that he is still there, filming.
She's in her office.
She's at the supermarket, annoyed, she's trying to cover the camera lens so Garrison would stop filming.
At the post office, she's trying to shoo him away, she's very angry that he's filming her.
She's on the toilet, and she clamps her legs shut, with hands before them for added security. She's outraged.
There are sobs here and there, a smattering of applause.
Barbrady
Oh, that was so touching.
Mayor McDaniels
[With envelope in hand.] And now, friends, it's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is... [Reaches into the envelope.]
Nurse Gollum
[Derisively.] Nurse Gollum.
Mayor McDaniels
Nurse Gollum!!
The room applauds and the spotlight moves from the Mayor to the nurse.
Nurse Gollum
Oh, boy.
Jimbo
[Interrupting.] Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in.
Jimbo takes the microphone.
Jimbo
Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China.
The crowd erupts in applause, meanwhile somewhere near China. The bus is going down a slope.
Chef
Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game.
Stan
But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
Chef
Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions.
Kyle
But we could get killed!
Chef
And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?
Stan and Kyle fall silent.
Chef
Just imagine: a big yellow "Dodgeball Champions" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!
Stan
Dude, Chef has lost it.
Chef
You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!
Cartman
So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?
Chef looks at him.
Kyle
Dude, what does that mean?
Cartman
I dunno.
Stan
Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?
Kevin looks back.
Kyle
Yeah, you're from China.
Kevin Stoley
No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese.
Stan
Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
Kevin
I have no idea, dude.
Cartman
Come on, rice picker!
Chef
Hey, hey hey!
Cartman hides his hands.
Chef
Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity.
Stan
You don't?
Kyle
But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people.
Chef
No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country.
Stan, Kyle
Ohhh.
Cartman
[At the same time.] Oooh, I get it.
Kevin
[Vindicated.] Yeah.
The bus has reached the temple. On the side is a banner that reads: Go Cows!
Mrs. Crabtree
[Slamming on the brakes.] AAAGGGGHHHH!
Chinese Commentator
Hiit ita wita great pride, that huwe huwelcome ourn American friend. Now let the...
He thumps the table, and his partner's mic falls.
Chinese Commentator
...champion of dodgeball be deshide!
His partner resets the mic, a muscular man bangs away on a kodo drum, and musicians next to him start playing. The crowd cheers, and dancers come up and unfurl streamers.
Stan
Damn, dude. China's fucked up.
Referee
Take places!
Chef
All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!
Chinese Commentator
Okay, Tom, rooks rike A-mericans are getting ready to play. I don't suppose they'll have any problems seeing the ball with their big American eyes!
They laugh.
Tom
Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect.
He laughs.
Chinese Commentator
Oh, you say such things.
Tom
That's a zinger!
Referee
Praaayyy braal!
The Chinese serve. The first one out is Clyde, who tumbles all the way to the wall.
Chef
Holy crap..!
Kyle is hit, twice, before he goes down.
Chef
God damn...
Chinese Commentator
Hey, hey, what do you call white American person with PhD in a physics and-a math?
Tom
Ah, I don't know. What?
Chinese Commentator
Stupid American!
He laughs.
Tom
Aw, no way!!
Tom starts laughing.
A Chinese player takes aim at Cartman, who turns and runs away squealing. The ball gets him anyway, and he tumbles away.
Chinese Commentator
Oooh, another American is down! It's numbuh-- uuhhh... Oh, I don't know. All American look alike!
They laugh, as a Chinese player serves and hits Kenny with such force that the ball picks him up and splatters him against the wall, then bounces up and away. Paint falls away and cracks are left in the wall. Blood pours out quickly. The crowd jumps up and cheers.
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle
[Laying on his side and out of breath.] You... bastards...
Chinese Commentator
Oooh, my, I haven't seen an American die like that since Abraham Lincoln!
He chuckles.
Tom
Dude, that is-a not cool! You're gonna get us into trouble again.
South Park Town Square. The town is assembled yet again.
Mayor McDaniels
Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China.
The town cheers.
Mayor McDaniels
Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats!
One of her aides passes out the hats as an organ plays. Nurse Gollum just watches.
Meanwhile, in China, at the Temple, Chef is tending to his injured players. Kyle is hooked up to an IV. The other players are bandaged up according to the severity of their injuries.
Chinese Commentator
And there is-a only a one South Park prayer left.
Pip stands alone on the court, Kenny is still plastered to the wall behind him.
Chinese Commentator
Still all Chinese prayer. This should be over veerry shortly.
Chinese kid
Come on! Throw ball!
Tom
Hey, you wanna hear my impersonation of American?
Chinese Commentator
Yeah, yeah!
Tom
Ah, okay.
Tom puts his hands to his eyelids and opens them wide to simulate American eyes, and talks in a deep voice.
Tom
Hey, I really, really want that. That looks good.
They have a good laugh.
Chinese Commentator
Hey, hey. Let me try, let me try.
He sets up with a deep voice.
Chinese Commentator
I'll use my credit card.
They laugh harder, and he resumes.
Chinese Commentator
Eh-eh-uh... Do you have any non-dairy creamer?
They both laugh.
Tom
Yes yes! [Laughs.] Y'all come a-back now, you hear?
They laugh so hard they fall from their chairs.
Chef
[Crestfallen.] Oh, what have I done?
Cartman comes over and sits next to him.
Chef
You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good.
Cartman bites into a chocolate bar.
Chef
If we had won the world championship, what then?
Kevin walks off.
Chef
It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.
Cartman farts and tries to fan it away.
Chef
Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?
The kids are stunned at this sudden reversal of desire.
Chef
Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home.
Chinese kid
Come on! Throw ball!
Kevin
[Walking over to player 70.] Hey, if you wanna make him throw the ball, say this.
Kevin hands him a note to read.
Player 70
Thanks, you American dumbass! [Reads it.] "You French piece of crap! Throw ball!"
Pip gets angry.
Player 70
"What's the matter, Frenchy? You got crepes in your ears."
The Chinese team laughs. Pip gets livid rather quickly.
Pip
Arrggghhh!
Pip starts spinning. The Chinese team watches as Pip picks up speed, and the players gasp. Pip releases the ball and it shoots all over the temple stadium, knocking out players left and right, until all of them are down. Pip slows down, and finally stops.
Chinese Commentator
And the winner is South Park Cows!
Musicians play.
Pip
Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day!
The South Park team is limping off the court, with Kyle taking his IV along.
Chef
Shut up, Pip.
Stan
Yeah, shut up, Pip. [To Chef.] Can we go home now?
Pip
Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
Kids, Chef
Shut up, Pip!
South Park Town Square. The Mayor is on stage.
Mayor McDaniels
As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation.
The crowd cheers.
Mayor McDaniels
Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows!
The team is standing behind a low wall with a trophy at one end, next to Chef. Kyle is dressed normally but still bandaged.
Kyle
What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
Mayor McDaniels
And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!
Kyle
Agghh!
Stan
Dude, it's the freak nurse!
Cartman
Holy crap!
Sheila
Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!
Kyle
Well sorry, dude, we weren't here.
Nurse Gollum
Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week.
Sheila
[Wiping away a tear.] She's really touched.
Nurse Gollum
What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks!
The crowd is stunned, Mayor McDaniels takes the mic from Nurse Gollum.
Mayor McDaniels
Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--
Nurse Gollum
Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?
Sheila and Father Maxi look betrayed.
Nurse Gollum
I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long.
More people look at each other.
Nurse Gollum
Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other.
People are listening.
Nurse gollum
And take those stupid things off your heads!
She turns and walks off the stage.
Principal Victoria
Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch.
Sheila
Yeah, the nerve of some people.
Kyle
Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
Stan
Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
Cartman
I love you guys.
Stan and Kyle merely look at him and say nothing.
Cartman
Ah, screw you guys!

	A television is on, and a new show seems to be on the air.
Announcer
And now back to Huntin' and Killin' with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!
Jimbo and Ned are on a studio based on a hunting lodge. Jimbo and Ned each have weapons, Ned's flamethrower is even lit, ready to go.
Jimbo
Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned.
Ned
M-hi, Ned.
Jimbo
Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?
The cameraman give him a thumbs up.
Jimbo
We have a terrific show for you today: we're gonna kill some elk, and we're gonna kill some mountain goats. Now, the new law passed by Colorado legislature, which Ned and I call "Pussy Law #4", states that we can no longer kill animals in defense.
"PUSSY LAW #4"
NO ANIMAL SHALL BE HARMED,
EVEN IN SELF DEFENSE, UNLESS
SPECIFIC LICENSE AND SEASON IS
IN ORDER. SELF DEFENSE CAN ONLY
BE JUSTIFIED BY EXTREME, PROVABLE
PERIL AND OR DOCUMENTED VISIBLE
BODILY HARM.
In other words, our old line of, "It's comin' right for us"--

Ned
It's comin' right for us.
Jimbo
--no longer works. So now, we only kill animals to, quote, "thin out their numbers". If we don't hunt, then these animals will grow too big in number and they won't have enough food. So you see, we have to kill animals, or else they'll die.
An awkward moment. Jimbo, Ned and the cameraman look at each other.
Jimbo
Uhh... So roll the tape.
A trill, and the tape shows a field into which Jimbo and Ned wander.
Jimbo
Here we are at Schaefer's Crossing, lookin' for some animals.
Jimbo
Lookie, Ned, there's some deers!
A group of deer looks up and stares at them.
Jimbo
Quick, Ned! Thin out their numbers!
Ned
Thin out their numbers!
Walks up to the deer and fires up the flamethrower, producing a huge flame. The deer are incinerated where they stand, and their bones crumble.
Jimbo
Good work, Ned. Now they won't starve.
Jimbo
That sure was a great hunting trip. We saved those deer from extinction.
Ned
Mmm-we're environmentalists.
Jimbo
Comin' up next, we're gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers. And also, try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species.
South Park Elementary. Class is in session. Mr. Garrison writes "Vietnam" on the blackboard.
Cartman
Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?
Mr. Garrison
"What's Vietnam?" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war.
Mr. Hat
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.
Kyle raises his hand.
Kyle
Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?
Mr. Garrison frowns as he seems to recall an incident in that war. An injured man is dragged to a helicopter as fresh troops wait to replace him.
Injured Man
Aaawwwgh... Aaawwwgh...
Leader
Come on, men! Let's go! Jump out of the chopper!
The class is waiting. Now Mr. Garrison is smiling as the next scene begins. A group of men is seen disrobed and bathing. At the end of it, he laughs to himself.
Man 1
Who's next to take a shower?
Man 2
Me-ee!
Man 3
I am.
Man 1
You just took one last week, silly.
Man 2
Oh, where can I hide this big pipe?
Mr. Garrison
No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper.
Class
Awww..!
Cartman
Son of a bitch.
Mr. Garrison
I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.
Clyde
What if we don't know anybody who was in Vietnam?
Mr. Garrison
Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit.
Clyde
Oh.
Stan
Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.
Kyle
Hey, yeah! He and Ned do that stupid TV show.
Back to Huntin' and Killin, in a special segment...
Jimbo
And now, time for Jimbo's Mysteries of the Unexplained.
The letters are wavy and uneven. The boys come to see the taping.
Jimbo
One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog's eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.
The film plays. Shown is a snowy field, with the camera looking from behind some blades of grass.
Jimbo
Now watch carefully, you're gonna see the Mexican staring frog.
Nothing seems to be happening.
Jimbo
There! There, did you see it? Roll that back again!
The film is replayed.
Jimbo
Now, freeze it!
The film is paused, and there is a very blurry object flying through the air.
Jimbo
Well, I'd like to know what all you skeptics have to say now! What do you think, Ned?
Ned
M-whoa, I'm scared.
Jimbo
Well, be sure to join us next time. Until then...
We're so glad you spent your time with us
While we slaughtered our way through nature's guts
Come again and stay a while
We'll kill a lot more living things to make them bleed

Ned
Mm-good night.
Cameraman
A-and we're cut. Great show, guys.
Jimbo
Oh, lookie who's here. My little nephew Stanley.
The boys approach him.
Jimbo
So, you're interested in your Uncle Jimbo's big TV show, huh?
Stan
No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
Jimbo
Oh. Yeah, we sure were.
Cartman
Was it fun?
Kyle
Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
Jimbo
Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun. No, Vietnam was more like shovin' shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin' in a tub of Tabasco sauce fun.
Stan
Whoa!
Jimbo
Yepper, that's where me and Ned met.
Flashback to circa 1975, to a beach. A man write something on a notebook as helicopters take turns landing on a helipad below. An amusement park is just to the right, with a carousel and a log ride. A log comes into view with screaming riders. "Time of the Season" by The Zombies, plays.
Jimbo
I remember I had just gotten off the Ferris wheel.
Jimbo
Oh, boy, what a gorgeous day!
A bird alights on his upper arm and sings to him. He whistles back.
Sergeant
Kern, get over here! The new privates are here. I'm assigning one of them to you as a trainee. Ned Gerblansky.
The crowd parts to reveal him.
Ned
Ned Gerblansky reporting, sir.
Sergeant
Thanks, Ned. Now, the bad guys have been spotted about ten klicks north of here. I know that you and Kern are best suited to take them out. Are you up for it?
Jimbo, Ned
Sir, yes, sir!
Actual footage of a helicopter flying off is shown.
Jimbo
Soon it was all on just me and Ned to win the war for America.
Jimbo
Pass me some more cocoa, will you, Ned?
Ned
Certainly. And would you like another muffin as well?
Jimbo
Why the hell not? We're at war.
Ned hands them over, then sits back, pulls out a cigarette and lighter, and lights the cigarette.
Jimbo
Hey, you know those things are bad for your throat.
Ned
No, that's all lies. I'll be fine. Charlies at 2 o'clock!
Jimbo studies the troop movements on the ground.
Jimbo
I see 'em! Drop the bomb!
Ned pulls the trigger, but nothing happens.
Ned
The bomb's not releasing!
Jimbo
Oh, no!
Ned
It won't budge.
Jimbo
Then we only have one option.
Jimbo forces the plane down.
Ned
What are you doing, man?!
Jimbo
We have to take 'em out, Ned! At all costs! Die, you red commie bastards!
Comes in for a crash landing, and enemy troops are running out of their way. Jimbo and Ned come out and shoot everyone they can. The enemy soldiers die on the spot. Ned pulls out a grenade to activate and throw at other enemy troops, but it goes off prematurely and takes off his right arm.
Ned
[His arm flies away.] Yaaarrrggghhh!!!
Jimbo
[Firing away.] Aaarrrggghh-- Oh no! Out of ammo!
Jimbo reaches behind himself and pulls out a sword. A horse with golden mane and tail trots in. Ned fights off the enemy troops with his good arm and martial arts skill, and Jimbo flies onto the horse. He sallies forth and decapitates every soldier he comes across. When the enemy soldiers are all dead, Jimbo puts the sword away, and they look at the corpses around them.
Jimbo
We did it, Ned! We killed the entire Vietcong Army!
Ned
Whoopie.
Ned brings out a cigarette and lights it with his good hand.
Jimbo
Let's get back to base camp. We can ride the log ride before it closes!
Ned flies onto the horse behind Jimbo, and horse and riders leap gracefully away, as we return to the present.
Jimbo
And that's the way it happened, boys.
Stan
Wow!
Cartman
Man, Vietnam was sweet!
Cameraman
[Reading a magazine.] Great news, guys. Your TV show ratings have doubled!
Jimbo
Wow!
Cameraman
They've gone from six people to twelve.
Jimbo
Holy smokes! We could get an Emmy!
South Park Public Access. The set of Jesus and Pals.
Producer
We've got to do it, J. Your ratings are being killed by the Jimbo and Ned Hunting Show.
Jesus
But I don't really care about that.
Producer
Wuhell, you'd better care, Mr. Smarty Pants. No ratings means no show. If you want to keep reaching out to people, you have to keep up with the times.
Jesus
[Reluctantly.] Ohh, alright.
Cameraman
Alright, we're ten second to air, guys.
Producer
Remember, big, big, big!.
She holds up her hands and moves them apart with each 'big.' Then she walks off.
Cameraman
And five, four, three...
Spotlight beams dance around the studio.
Announcer
[Applause] It's your hour of power on midday Mountain Cable Access. Put your hands together and welcome the only man in town who always has a fully-stocked wine cellar, Jeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-sus Christ!
Jesus is caught off guard as a spotlight jumps to him.
Jesus
Uhhh... Hi.
His producer signals him to build up his intro.
Jesus
Uh, yeh-yeah, okay. Beginning today, we're taking the show in a new direction.
A stage hand guides him through with the cue cards.
Jesus
We've got some very interesting people coming on the show this week for you, our viewers. Today's guest is: TV's Gilligan, Mr. Bob Denver.
Applause, as the curtains open.
Announcer
Here's Booooobbb Denver.
He makes his way to Jesus. They shake hands and sit down.
Jesus
Hi, Bob Denver.
Bob
Hi, Jesus. Great to be here.
His tongue is exposed. There is a pause as they look at each other.
Jesus
So. Bob. So, yu-you just get in town?
Bob
Yup. Just got in.
Jesus
[Pause.] So... Um... Su-so, wwhat have you been up to?
Bob
Nn-nothing. Nothing really at all.
The producer cues the studio and to play.
Disciples vocalist
'Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
You gotta have something

Jesus
[Cynically.] Oh boy.
South Park Elementary. Stan is presenting his group's report, reading from his notes.
Stan
"...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp."
Mr. Garrison is behind Clyde.
Stan
"Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster."
Mr. Garrison gets a reaction.
Stan
"...and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride."
Mr. Garrison is suspicious.
Stan
"So was the horror of Vietnam." The end.
The Boys
The end.
Kyle
Are there any questions?
Mr. Garrison raises his hand.
Kyle
Yes, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
Yes. [Suddenly angry.] Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit?
The boys' grins vanish.
Stan
From Vietnam veterans.
Mr. Garrison
Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie.
Stan
No, no, we didn't--
Mr. Garrison
You all receive an F...minus.
Kyle
F-minus? Can he do that?
Stan
Bu-but we're not making it up, it was--
Mr. Garrison
Stanley, the Vietnam War was war! There weren't galloping steeds or singing birds or log rides.
Kyle
How do you know? You weren't even there.
Mr. Garrison
Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!
Boys
Aawwww!
South Park Elementary, cafeteria. Mr. Mackey is supervising detention.
Cartman
Sweet.
Mr. Mackey
Welcome to detention, m'kay? Mr. Garrison told me about your little joke. It's important for you all to know why you're in detention for you to obtain the full benefits from it.
Cartman
You're dead, Stan.
Stan
For what, dude?
Kenny
(Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!)
Mr. Mackey
[While the boys talk softly.] You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?
Cartman
Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.
Kyle
Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!
Mr. Mackey
Shh! M'kay?
Stan
Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
Cartman
Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!
Mr. Mackey
Shh! M'kay?
Kyle
[Pounds the table.] We've got to get him back, dude.
Cartman
Totally.
Stan
How?
Kyle
Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
Stan
Well, what do you mean?
Kyle
Did you guys ever see that one Brady Bunch where the guy... [Indistinct whisper.]
Cartman
[As Kyle whispers his plot.] Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!
Jimbo and Ned back on the set.
Announcer
And now back to Huntin' and Killin' with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!
Jimbo
Welcome, hunters. Boy, have we got a show for you today! We have just received a tape from another viewer who filmed the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka right here in South Park.
Ned
Aggghhh!
Jimbo
Yes, now we're about to roll the film, but remember: if you look the Mexican staring frog in the eyes, you could go catatonic. We don't know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not, but who wants to take chances? So when we roll this film, be sure to look away.
Jimbo looks away and shields his eyes with his arm. Ned does the same.
Jimbo
Okay, roll the film, Tom.
Tom starts the film and looks away. The footage is that of a fake frog sitting on a doorstep motionless.
Jimbo
Is it over? Okay, it's over.
They lower their arms and sit up.
Jimbo
Well, there you have it. Undeniable proof that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka exists.
Cartman residence. The boys are watching the show.
Jimbo
And you saw it here, on The Jimbo and Ned Show.
Kyle
Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
Stan
Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.
Kenny
(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.)
They all laugh.
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
Come on! We've gotta make another one!
The boys get off the couch and leave.
Cartman
Lying kicks ass!
South Park Public Access. Meanwhile...
Producer
Jesus!
Jesus
Yeah?
Producer
We're in trouble. The Jimbo and Ned Show made up some ridiculous staring frog story and jumped another two points in the ratings!
Jesus
Uh-oh, sssooo what are we supposed to do?
Producer
I don't know. We'll have to continue with the changes we've made, and then go even further.
Stage Hand
And we're back in five, four, three...
Producer
Remember, big, big, big!
Jesus and Pals has a new opening sequence, with Jesus walking backwards into view and throwing his jacket over his shoulder. Meanwhile, 'Jesus and Pals' scrolls along the bottom as both his logo drops down from above. His signature blinks here and there. A montage follows with Jesus talking to a monkey in one screen and Jesus waiting for calls in another. The last thing you see is J&P.
Jesus
If you're just joining us, we've been listening to Michelle's incredible story of survival. Go on, Michelle.
Michelle
[Tearfully.] Well, as I was saying, I tried and tried, but my overturned car just won't budge. My husband was trapped for twelve hours.
Jesus
And yet, somehow, he managed to survive.
Michelle
That's right. He's a very brave man, and I love him very much.
Husband
[In a wheelchair, head bandaged.] I love you, too.
Jesus
W-well, let's see if the audience has any questions.
A large woman raises her hand.
Jesus
Yes, uhh, you over there.
Jesus walks down to her.
Large Woman
I think she needs to kick him to the curb, baby!
The audience applauds.
Jesus
Kick who to the curb?
Large Woman
Her no-good husband! She's got to lose that zero and get herself a hero!
The audience applauds.
Jesus
But--
Red-Haired Woman
He wants to have his cake and eat it, too. He's got to dump that trash girlfriend.
She grabs the mic.
Red-Haired Woman
It's all about respect. You've gotta have respect for yourself.
The audience applauds. Michelle is shocked, and her husband drools a little blood.
Jesus
Uuh-I think we've somewhat missed the point here. Let's go to somebody else.
Jesus backs up to an African American.
Jesus
Yes, your comments.
African-American
Montel, I think we're forgetting something very important in all of this. Okay, sure, he touched some children, but the man is a great singer and he has entertained us for so many years.
esus
Wha-what are you talking about?
African-American
Michael Jackson. All this baad-mouthin' and puttin' the man down. Maybe he did touch some children now and then, but come on! It's Michael Jackson! Michael Jackson!
The audience applauds.
Jesus
Uhh, we'll be back right after these messages.
In the woods, the boys set up for another staring frog video. Cartman is behind some bushes and Kyle is in front of them. Stan and Kenny face them.
Stan
Ready, you guys?
Kyle/Cartman
Ready.
Cartman is hiding behind the bush.
Stan
Okay. Action!
The camera rolls, and the frog is dangling from a fishing pole, jumping around. Cartman, holding the pole, speaks in a spooky voice.
Cartman
Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
Stan
Cut! Cartman!
Cartman
[Popping up.] What?
Stan
It's supposed to be a frog!
Cartman
I know that!
Stan
Since when do frogs talk, Cartman?
Cartman
[Thinks.] It's a Sri Lanka frog!
Kyle
[Holding the camera.] Der, Cartman!
Cartman
Der yourself, hippie!
Kyle
Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! [Resumes filming.]
Stan
Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
Cartman
[Pops up.] I'm ready, Steven Spielberg! [Drops.]
Stan
Action!
Cartman
[Moves the frog around.] Blulululuh. Screw you guys.
Downtown. The boys have Cartman wearing a grey wig, a pink dress, and black high heels.
Cartman
Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?
Kyle
'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
Cartman
Ee-goddammit!
Stan
Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
Cartman
They better not!
Stan
Okay, when I yell "action", you start to walk this way, then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
Cartman
Scared of a plastic frog?
Stan
It's acting, Cartman. You have to pretend you're really scared, then the Mexican staring frog will look you in the eyes, then you fall down, like you're dead, okay? Ready?
Cartman
Man, this is stupid.
Stan
Good. A-and action!
Kenny walks in front of the camera with the frog, as Cartman screams and falls on his back.
Cartman
Eee-ee-ee-ee!
Jimbo and Ned back on the set.
Jimbo
Well, it appears as though a lot of you "skeptics" thought that the film we showed of the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka was a fake. That you say it didn't harm anybody. Well, it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer. [Looks away.] Roll it!
The two scenes have been spliced together, except that Cartman falls on his left side, and Kenny added his own touch by mooning the camera.
Jimbo
There you go! Proof that not only is this frog real, but it is doing harm to the people of South Park as we speak!
Ned
Mmmm-damn that frog.
Jimbo
Well, that does it! All this week, Ned and I will be--
South Park Public Access. His producer is watching Huntin' and Killin'.
Jimbo
--risking life and limb as we go on location to hunt the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Join us, won't ya?
Producer
Ooh, no, no, no, no!
Jesus walks up behind her.
Producer
This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen! Damn, those hunters are clever!
Jesus
Uhhh, clever?
Producer
It's genius, it really is. Hell, I even want to watch them hunt the Mexican staring frog. Unless...
Jesus
Unless what?
Producer
Unless we can prove to the City world that the whole thing is a sham. If we prove that the Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka is just something..made up by Jimbo and Ned, we can have them taken off the air. Perhaps even killed!
Jesus
Look, why don't we just stick to our own show? People will watch again.
Producer
[Wearily.] Oh, J. You are so omnipotent, and yet so naive. We'll launch a full investigation, and in the meantime, we can cash in on the video tapes.
Jesus
What video tapes?
A commercial begins.
Jesus
Yea, children. I am the way and the light...
Announcer
You've seen Jesus and Pals. Now you've got to get the video!
Jesus and Pals: Too Hot for TV!
A man pours some whipped cream on the chest of a topless bikini-clad woman wearing a cowboy hat.

Announcer
Things get a little out of control!
Another guest yells obscenities at another guest, but his mouth is censored.
Announcer
You won't believe your eyes!
Jesus is flanked by two Klansmen as he interviews them.
Announcer
Order now, only $19.95!
Jesus is Lord!!! Visa, MC, and AmEx accepted.
Announcer
Remember, this is stuff you can't see on TV!
Two other women in bikinis take off their tops and dance around. Their breasts are censored with bars saying "TOO HOT!!!"
Next day. Jimbo and Ned with cameraman Tom and producer drive through the town.
Jimbo
Anonymous tip?
Tom
Yeah, it was left on our answering machine. All it said was that they saw the Mexican staring frog just south of Stark's Pond this morning.
Jimbo
Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in 'Nam?
Tom
You were in 'Nam? Where were you stationed?
Ned
Mmm-Da Nang.
Cameraman
With the log ride?
Jimbo
Yep.
Tom
Man, I was in Tet. We had a bad-ass roller coaster, but... all we ever wanted was a log ride. We waited and we waited, but... they never built us one. I think..Danforth wanted the log ride more than anybody, but he... he had to settle with that lame dinosaur water adventure ride.
Jimbo
That war was hell on everybody.
Tom starts sobbing.
Producer
Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week's ratings are through the roof! We're up to twenty people!
Jimbo
Wow! Do we got more money?
Producer
No, but I do. We're now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!
The boys are back in the woods, and their frog is on a small boulder.
Kyle
Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
Cartman
Dude, totally.
Stan
They deserve it for lying to us, dude.
Cartman
[Relishing the moment.] Revenge is so very, very sweet.
Stan
They're here! Hurry and hide!
They run for cover in a patch of shrubs. Jimbo stops his hummer and the men get out.
Jimbo
Let's hunt!
Producer
We'll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--
Ned
Mm-Jimbo, look!
Jimbo
Hit the deck!
They hide behind a snow drift.
Producer
What is it?
Jimbo
It's him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He's right over there on that rock.
Producer
He is?
Jimbo
Dumb-ass! You've got to keep your eyes away from him!
The producer tries to sneak a peek, but Jimbo forces him down again.
Jimbo
Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I'll try and keep it turned away from you.
Ned
Mm-roger that.
Ned leaves the drift, as Jimbo stands, facing the camera.
Jimbo
Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.
Ned moves behind the cameraman and begins his assault.
Jimbo
The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.
Ned jumps from behind one tree to behind another.
Jimbo
We've got to take the frog by surprise. I'm gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device, while Ned will ambush him from the rear.
Jimbo pulls the pin out and throws the grenade behind him. It hits the rock, but the plastic frog simply went about face.
Jimbo
Now, Ned! He's not looking!
Ned advances quickly.
Jimbo
Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!
Silence.
Jimbo
Ned. Ne-ed?
He turns around and draws closer to the rock. He sees Ned, now catatonic, looking at the frog.
Jimbo
Oh, no!
Close-up. Ned's hair stands on end.
Jimbo
Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!
Ned's gun drops from his good arm.
Jimbo
Come back to me, buddy.
Producer
You getting all this?
The cameraman smiles and gives a thumbs up.
Jimbo
Hold onto your butts.
Jimbo fires away at the frog with his shotgun.
Jimbo
Take that, you demon frog!
Jimbo rushes up to Ned.
Jimbo
Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?
He turns to his crew.
Jimbo
Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!
Producer
Get the Flight for Life helicopter!
The boys rise out of the shrubs.
Stan
Holy crap, dude.
Hells Pass Hospital. Jimbo is at Ned's bedside reading to him.
Jimbo
..."but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, 'stay gold.'"
Jimbo closes the book and watches Ned.
Jimbo
Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you've got to snap out of it, 'cause if you don't, uh-I'll never forgive myself.
The boys enter the room.
Jimbo
Aw, Stanley, he's gone! My only friend in the world is gone!
Stan
Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
Kyle
Look!
Kyle holds up the plastic frog, which puts Jimbo on guard.
Jimbo
Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!
Stan
Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
Jimbo drops his guard and inspects the frog.
Jimbo
What..?
Stan
We shot all those videos and sent them in.
Kyle
Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! [Grins.]
Jimbo
You sent in those videos?!
Producer
[On the phone.] Oh, this is not good.
Jimbo
My best friend is a vegetable, and I'm gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!
Kyle
Aw, come on. Ned's faking it. That frog was just a piece of plastic!
Stan
Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'.
No response from Ned.
Jimbo
You boys don't understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.
Jesus' Producer is suddenly at the doorway with a satellite listening device.
Jesus' Producer
It's a psychosomatic response. [Entering.] I couldn't help overhearing your conversation just now.
Kyle
Who are you?
Jesus' Producer
I produce a little TV show called Jesus and Pals, you might have heard of it. Your story is amazing; full of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing and bitterness.
Jimbo
Uhhhh... Thanks?
Jesus' Producer
How would you like to share your remarkable story with us on tomorrow's show?
Jesus and Pals, after a commercial break. Today's topic: Tots in Trouble.
Jesus
We're back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can't stop lying, can't they?
Jimbo
That's right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.
A woman claps.
Jimbo
Thanks. We've been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!
Jesus
Is that true, Stan?
Stan
It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
Jesus looks over to see his producer signaling him to call for a break.
Jesus
Uhh, we'll find out more about this debauchery when we return.
Cameraman
A-and we're out.
Jesus walks off the stage, as the producer walks on.
Producer
You're corpses out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!
Jimbo
Like what?
Producer
Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.
Jimbo
Satan. Got it.
Stan
Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
Jimbo
Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!
Producer
And you kids! I didn't bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.
Cartman raises his hand.
Cartman
Dibs!
Producer
Remember, you all start to fight after the chair is thrown. That's your cue.
Jimbo
Roger.
The theme music plays again and the crowd applauds for the next segment. Action.
Jesus
Welcome back to Jesus and Pals. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?
Jimbo
I'll tell you why. Because he's on drugs and worships the devil!
The audience and Stan gasp.
Audience
Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!
Jesus
Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you.
Stan
Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me.
Jesus' jaw drops. The audience boos, and the sound man and the director high-five each other.
Jimbo
Why, you little piece of crap!
Stan
You big piece of crap!
Cartman
That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!
Cartman takes his chair and throws it at Ned.
Cartman
Take that, hippie!
The chair hits Ned, who continues to just sit there.
Jimbo
Hey!
Audience
Jeesus! Jeesus!
Jimbo picks up his chair and throws it at Cartman. The chair hits a woman in the right side of her head in the audience and she gets up angry. She heads for the stage.
Jesus tries to calm things down.
Jesus
O-okay, okay, that's enough.
Woman
[Slugs Jimbo.] Take that, you asshole!
Jimbo falls. She jumps on him and strikes again.
Woman
What the fuck was that?
Jesus
Uh, let's watch the language, people.
Jimbo
Bring it on, you bitch!
She hits him again.
Cartman
Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!
Audience
Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!
A blond man pushes Jesus out of the way as he heads for the stage. The rest of the audience follow suit, and soon everyone is fighting.
Jesus
Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
Kenny is being pulled apart by two men.
Kenny
(Nononono-yikes!)
A man in a green shirt hits Kenny in the face with a chair.
Kenny is ripped in half.
Man in Green Shirt pulling Kenny
Yeah, yeah, yeh... [Gasps.]
Man in Blue Shirt pulling Kenny
Yeah, yeah, yeh-oh?
Man with Chair hitting Kenny
Oh, Oh! Aah! AAAAGGHH!!! [Gasps.] Ooh.. Ew [Shrieks.]
Kenny begins Crying.
Kenny
[Sobbing.] (OW! OW! DUDE, PLEASE STOP!! OH, FUCK! YIKES!!!!!)
The 3 men, Stan, & Kyle gasp in horror to see what happened.
Stan
Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Cartman comes flying across the stage.
Cartman
Ey, you guys!
Two men just sitting in the audience start to fight for no reason.
Jesus
Let's all just..make our way back to our seats.
Woman
Oh, my God!
A man walks by with a chainsaw.
Jesus
Shut the fuck up!
The audience members stop and gasp at him. Cartman was biting at the leg of a man onstage.
Jesus
Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused.
The audience members slowly return to their seats.
Stan
W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble.
A couple of rats come by and drag Kenny's upper half away.
Jimbo
Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.
Stan
Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
Jesus
The entire Vietcong Army?
Jimbo
I uh... Well, okay, I might have embellished the truth a little, but that's different.
Jesus
Is it?
Jimbo
Well, sure. I mean, eh... [Pinned.] Well, no uh, I guess not.
Jesus
And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--
Stan
Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
Jesus
Wait. Jimbo made that up?
Stan
No, your producer did.
This gets the producer's attention.
Stan
She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.
Jesus
What?
Stan
During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
Jimbo
It's true, she did. Hu-I'm such a tool.
Jesus
Oh, really?
The producer is now trying to hide behind a potted plant.
Kyle
Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
Cartman
Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.
Man in Brown Shirt
Screw this show. I thought this was all real.
The audience members begin to leave.
Jesus
W-wait, everybody. Come back.
African-American
[Pats Jesus on the shoulder.] Don't feel too bad, Montel. We all want to touch children sometimes; it's only natural.
South Park Public Access, outside. Later...
Jimbo
I'm sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.
Stan
W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
Kyle
Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
Jimbo
Aw, he'll be fine. I'll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he'll snap right out of it. Won't you, Ned?
Jimbo slaps him on the shoulder, and Ned falls like a statue. A door opens.
Jesus
I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.
Jimbo
Yeah. Titties and beer.
Jesus
Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can't wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--
Kyle
Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
Jesus
[Upset.] I sent her away.
Cartman
Sent her away where?
Hell. She enters Satan's lair with phone in hand. Pitchforks rise and begin poking her.
Producer
What is this? What's happening?!
Satan
Welcome to my dominion.
Producer
[Retreating.] Oooooohhhh!
Saddam Hussein
[Comes up behind Satan and stands next to him.] Hey. Take a load off. Put your feet up. Me and Satan were just aboot to go shopping for furniture. Come on, Satan.
Satan
Okay, honey.
They turn around and walk away, the camera enters her mouth as she screams.
Producer
Noooooo!
End of The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka.
War is hell
My brother's a dirty mess
In war, war is hell
It's hell for you and me

Ms. Crabtree
BE QUIET BACK THERRE! THESE ROADS ARE SLIICK!
Stan
Hey, Cartman!
Cartman
What?
Stan
Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
Cartman
[Finishes a bite.] Hmmm, let me see. No!
Kyle
Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
Cartman
Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
Stan
Give us some, Cartman!
Ms. Crabtree
[Turns around.] BE QUIET BACK THERRE!
Kyle
Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
Stan
Dude, the road is always snowy.
Kyle
I know, but, it's really snowy today.
Cartman
[Now baiting.] Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. [Resumes eating.]
Stan
Shut up, Cartman!
Ms. Crabtree slams on the brakes, opens a box, and pulls out a bunny.
Ms. Crabtree
Okay, that does it! Y'all be quiet or the cute little bunny dies!
She now points a gun at its head. The class gasps and look at her for a while. Sure that she has made her point, she puts the bunny back in the box and resumes driving.
Stan
Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.
Kyle
Oh, she would, dude. She would.
The bus comes to a halt at a road block.
Ms. Crabtree
GOODD!
The sign reads: Road Closed due to Avalanche. Detour at your own risk.
Ms. Crabtree
OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!
She starts up the bus and takes the detour.
Stan
Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
Cartman
[Exhausted.] I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
Kyle
Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!
Ms. Crabtree
[Spins around.] WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
She turns back around just to see the bus head for a road shoulder where the road starts to turn.
Ms. Crabtree
Whoa oh.
She slams the brakes on, but the bus goes over the shoulder and tumbles down the side of the hill.
Ms. Crabtree
Hold oonn! Aaaaa!
The kids tumble all over the place and scream, but Cartman just munches away on the cake, quite undisturbed. The bus bounces on the bottom of the hill and lands on a river upright, floating on down.
Kids
Aaaah!
Kyle
I'm scared!
Ms. Crabtree
BE QUIET, KID!
The kids look back at where they were as the bus continues down the river - and over a waterfall, straight down.
All
Aaaah!
Near the river, a guide is taking a couple bird-watching.
Guide
...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They're indigenous to this area.
The guide walks forward. The husband takes a picture of the chickadee. In the background, the bus falls past them.
The Kids
Aaaah!
Wife
What was that?
Guide
[Turns.] What was what?
At the foot of the waterfall. The bus plunges into the water and bobs up facing backwards.
All
Aaaah-
It is carried further down until the river bends. Then the bus is washed up onto the river bank, on the other side of which is a cliff. The bus teeters on the precipice.
Cartman
All done!
Ms. Crabtree
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!
Cartman takes his seat, but leaves the cake tin on the floor. The rest of the kids moan and groan, and they are strewn all over the bus.
Ms. Crabtree
I SAID 'QUIET,' OR ELSE I KILL THE BUNNY!
The bunny and gun are out again, and the kids shut up.
Stan
Where are we?
Ms. Crabtree
I have no idea.
Stan
I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
Kyle
Yeah, what are we supposed to do?
Ms. Crabtree
Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual.
She reaches for it and leafs through until she gets to it. She tosses the book away and reaches for the videotape drawer.
Cartman
Ms. Crabtree?
Ms. Crabtree
SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!
Trainer
[The video starts.] Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.'
Ms. Crabtree
KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!
Trainer
That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'
Ms. Crabtree
I'm goin' for help. Ah'll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don't get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!
She gets off the bus and walks down the river bank. The bus teeters a bit.
Boy In The Red Shirt
Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat her?
Kyle
'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
Ms. Crabtree
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
Kyle
I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
Ms. Crabtree
Oh.
Stan
Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
A roadside. Ms. Crabtree has found a vertical path leading down to the road and climbs down some large boulders.
Ms. Crabtree
Had to happen to me, didn't it?
Reaches the curb and puts out a thumb.
Truck Driver
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too-

The truck driver sees Ms. Crabtree, then lowers the mirror and sets his hair.
Truck Driver
Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa.
He stops his rig and lowers the passenger window.
Truck Driver
Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way?
Ms. Crabtree
SHUT UP AND HELP ME INTO THIS THIING!
Truck Driver
Whoa. Hehum huh.
Ms. Crabtree
[Grunts.] Yeah! [Now seated.] COME ON! I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY!
Truck Driver
Uh huh. Alright, sure, of course.
He checks out her legs and grins.
Ms. Crabtree
TAKE ME TO THE NEAREST TOWN AND MAKE IT SNAPPY, YOU FREAK-ASS CRACKPOT!
Truck Driver
Uuuh, yeh, yes ma'am. Righta right away, ma'am.}
He starts up the truck.
Truck Driver
So uh... Uhwhat's a- fragile little doe like yourself doin' out on a, on a night like this?
Ms. Crabtree
LOOK, MISTER, I GOT A BUSLOAD OF KIDS TRAPPED UP ON THAT PASS! I NEED A CRANE, HELICOPTERS, ALL THAT CRAP! HERE, LET ME HAVE SOME O' YOUR ASPIRIN!
She takes a couple.
Truck Driver
Uh uh- ma'am, those are actually roofies.
Ms. Crabtree
ROOFIES, ASPIRIN, RIGHT NOW I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS!
The driver is quite happy right now.
Ms. Crabtree
HOW FAR TO THE NEAREST TOOWWN?!
Truck Driver
Mm-... mm-it's a ways.
Next day, and the bus is still there.
Cartman
You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.
Kids
[Gasp, then individually.] What? Huh?
Kyle
We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days.
The others gasp.
Stan
Dude!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes! [Panics.] You guys suck!
Stan
Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
Kyle
Worse than this?
Stan
Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
Stan's Tale: from Cartman Gets An Anal Probe, but with a twist. The boys and Wendy, are in the forest waiting for the visitors, using Cartman, who is tied to a tree by his foot, as bait.
Cartman tugs at his foot, testing the rope.
Cartman
Oh, man, this sucks.
Kyle
How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
Stan
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Cartman
[Farts fire.] Ow!
Wendy
Hey, he's like Rudolph.
Kyle
Yeah. [Shouting] All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
Cartman
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
Kyle
Sure you do!
Stan
Come on Cartman, fart!
Cartman
I don't wanna.
Stan
[To Kyle and Wendy] He can't hold it in forever.
Kyle
Fart, damn you!
Cartman
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!
Cartman farts, and an anal probe comes out of his butt.
Kyle
Whoa, look at that.
Cartman
It's completely immature!
The probe is starting to resemble a truck.
Stan
Hey, it's happening again.
The assembly is done, and a clerk stands ready to serve ice cream.
Stan
It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
Cartman
You guys can't scare me!
Stan
Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass.
The mother ship and three daughter ships come down, and visitors appear. They walk over to the truck.
Kyle
Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
Stan
Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay.
He walks over to Wendy and kisses her good.
Wendy
Mmmm.
Back to the bus.
Stan
Now, that was what I call a sticky situation.
The kids laugh.
Kyle
You can say that again.
Cartman
Was that how it happened?
In the Trucker's Cab.
Ms. Crabtree
STOOPP! LET ME OFF, YOU TURD!
Truck Driver
Hey. Uh I wanna help you. Uh, I care a lot about that bus full of uuh- what was it again?
Ms. Crabtree
Children.
Truck Driver
Yeah right. Leh, let me come with you.
They get out of the truck and head over to Pauly Shore's Funny Pit.
Ms. Crabtree
WHO- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAAP?!
Carrot Ass
[On stage.] I hate flyin'. Talk about somethin' I hate, it's flyin'.
Truck Driver
[Nudging Ms. Crabtree.] Say uuhh, are those roofies kickin' in yet?
Ms. Crabtree
WELL, I DON'T THINK SO!
Truck Driver
Damn!
Carrot Ass
D'you guys like impressions?
Patron
No!
Carrot Ass
Here's my impression of Robert De Niro.
Carrot Ass turns around, makes adjustments, and turns again.
Carrot Ass
Hey, youse. Youse guys. Shut up, youse!
Ms. Crabtree
YOU SUUCK!!
The audience roars with laughter.
Carrot Ass
Youse guys, shut up!
Ms. Crabtree
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!
More laughter.
Carrot Ass
[As Barney, the dinosaur.] Come on, lady. Iii love you. You love me.
Ms. Crabtree
I SAAIID, SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!
More laughter. A man falls down from laughing so hard. Carrot Ass pees in his pants and walks off stage. A talent scout walks up to Ms. Crabtree.
Talent Scout
Baby, you're wonderful! You're a natural! You're the funniest comic I've seen in yeauhs!
Ms. Crabtree
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP. I'VE GOT TO GET SOME ASSISTANCE FOR MY BROKEN-DOWN BUUSS!!
Talent Scout
Broken-down bus! That's great! Great angle!
Night time at the precipice.
Stan
Do you see 'er dude?
Kyle
Nope.
Cartman
God-dammit, how long is this goin' to take?
Boy In The Red Shirt
She's never coming back. Don't you get it? She left us here to die like pigs.
Kyle
Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.
Kenny
[Miffed at Kyle.] (Huh?)
Boy In The Red Shirt
I can't take it anymore! I have to get out of here! [He begins to hyperventilate.]
Stan
No, kid! You heard what Ms. Crabtree said: there's a big black scary monster out there!
Boy In The Red Shirt
Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help.
Kyle
Don't do it, kid.
The kid in the red shirt kid hops off the bus and the rest of the class goes over to the left side of the bus to see him off.
Stan
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
The boy turns around and smiles. The bushes behind him rustle. The kids look stunned as the monster comes out of the trees and snatches him up.
Boy In The Red Shirt
Nooooo-agh!
The monster picks him up and swallows him whole.
Kyle
Holy crap, dude!
The monster turns and scurries away. The precipice is quiet for a while before the boy's skeleton is tossed back. It lands on one of the bus windows and slowly slides down, leaving some blood. The kids jump back and run around confused.
Bebe
Gross!
The kids take their seats.
Stan
Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
South Park, the next day. Liane Cartman prepares some Cookie Dings dough for baking, and the phone rings, and she answers it.
Liane
Hello?
Sharon
Oh, hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother.
Liane
Oh yes, Sharon. How are you?
Sharon
Ms. Cartman, is your son at home?
Liane
Hu-old on, dear, let me check.
Liane lowers the phone.
Liane
Hon, I made beefy logs.
Silence.
Liane
I made Cookie Dings.
Silence.
Liane
No, he's not here.
Sharon
Well, now I am worried. I've tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are.
Liane
Oh, dear!
Denver.
Talent Scout
I'm telling you, Marty, this woman is a natural! I haven't seen a funnier person since Maury Povich.
Marty
What's her angle?
Talent Scout
I can't even explain it. You have to see it.
Marty
Alright. Well, this better be good.
The talent scout turns around and goes to the door.
Talent Scout
Come on in, come on in.
Ms. Crabtree
WHUAT THE HELL DID YOU BRING ME TO DENVER FOR, YOU BRAIN-DEPRAVED FECOPHILIAC?!
Talent Scout
Mr. Jonus, this is Mrs. Crabtree.
Marty
Pleasure to meet you.
Ms. Crabtree
YOU LOOK LIKE A LUMP OF DOGSHIT JUST GOT HIT BY A CAR!!
Talent Scout
What did I tell you?
Marty
She's fantastic. How would you like to make a million dollars, baby?
Ms. Crabtree
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SUCK MY ASS?!
Marty
Let's get started right away.
Truck Driver
Are you gonna be all right?
Ms. Crabtree
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Truck Driver
Uh ah-I'm sorry. Do you need anything?
Ms. Crabtree
No. I just...
Truck Driver
What?
Ms. Crabtree
I can't help but feel that I've forgotten somethin'.
Another night at the precipice.
Stan
What time is it?
Kenny
(Almost 7:30.)
Kyle
On Wednesday or Thursday?
Stan
Dude, I think it's Saturday now.
Cartman
What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
Kyle turns around and stares out the back window.
Kyle
Aw man, I don't think it's very safe to be on this bus.
Stan
Well, we can't go anywhere or else that big scary monster outside will get us.
Cartman
What do you think it is?
Stan
I don't know, it's- a big scary monster.
Kyle turns to listen.
Kyle
Hey. Maybe it's that thing, Scuzzlebutt. [He sits back down.]
Stan
What?
Kyle
Don't you remember? That time we were out hunting with your uncle Jimbo and Ned.
Kyle's Tale: from Volcano, with a twist. Jimbo, Ned, and the boys are running from the flowing lava.
Boys
Aaaaaa!
Jimbo
The lava's comin' right for us!
Cartman
Heellp!
The lava is charging down the hill, and the boys, Jimbo, and Ned have reached the trench. Scuzzlebutt appears, and they stare in awe.
Jimbo
Jimminy Hope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!
Cartman
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Kyle
Oh my God! Look at his leg!
Brent Musberger
Hi kids, I'm TV's Brent Musberger.
Kyle
Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
All
Aaaa!
Jimbo
Quick Ned, shoot it!
Ned tries to cock the gun but nothing is happening.
Ned
Mmm. Oh no, out of ammo.
Stan
Hey, look!
Scuzzlebutt
Grrrr.
Scuzzlebutt has fashioned some ice cream cones out of thin air.
Kyle
Dude! He's making ice cream.
Scuzzlebutt offers the cones to the boys, Cartman takes the chocolate one.
Cartman
Scuzzlebutt kicks ass!
Kyle
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.
The kids laugh.
Stan
Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
Cartman
Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.
Kyle
Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
Cartman
Oh no? Don't you remember the time he went crazy, and tried to kill Kathie Lee Gifford?
Cartman's Tale: from Weight Gain 4000. Mr. Garrison is in the book depository waiting for Kathie Lee to pass by.
Mayor McDaniels
[Excitedly.] Here she comes!
The band marches down the street, followed by Kathie Lee Gifford's car and entourage. She's in her bubble waving to the crowds.
Mr. Garrison
Come on you little bitch.
He takes aim, but the view is fuzzy as he focuses in on her.
Mayor McDaniels
[On stage.] It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
The crowd cheers. Kathie Lee's security force throw her, bubble and all, on stage.
Kathie Lee
Thank you.
Mr. Garrison has his target, but Stan and Wendy rush in.
Stan
Mr. Garrison, stop!
Mr. Garrison
[He turns to face them.] Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
Wendy
But Mr. Garrison!
Mr. Garrison
[Faces them again.] She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien.
Kathie Lee
Thank you. And I love you all.
A shot pierces the bubble and enters Kathie Lee's head. The crowd gasps as she holds her head. She rips it open to reveal a vicious little green alien.
Alien
Naawwr!
The alien jumps out of the bubble. Mr. Garrison follows it in his sights and shoots it dead.
Mr. Garrison
[Facing Stan and Wendy.] See, I told ya.
Stan and Wendy shrug and lock lips.
Wendy
Mmmm.
Mayor McDaniels
[Sheepishly giddy.] Wow, this is gonna put a damper on the day. [Into the mic.] Let's have ice cream, everyone! [The crowd cheers.]
Cartman is on stage, totally ripped, he flexes with a vanilla ice cream cone in his left hand.
Cartman
Beefcaake!
Cartman
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.
The kids laugh.
Stan
But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
Cartman
Oh, yeah.
Burbank, NBC Studios, 11:35 p.m.
Announcer
Live from Burbank, it's The Tonight Show, with Jay Leno. Tonight, Jay's special guests include: Washed-up Actress from a sitcom. And the comedy of Mrs. Crabtree. And now, here's your host, Jay Leno.
He comes out with a very long chin, down to his knees. He turns and waves at the audience.
Talent Scout
Just relax, sweetheart, you're gonna kill out there.
Ms. Crabtree
KILL WHO?!
Talent Scout
Huh that's great. Use that. [Holds up his thumbs.]
Truck Driver
Honey du-, do you need anything?
Ms. Crabtree
JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE OF THEM ROOFIES.
Truck Driver
[Rushing up.] Sure.
He offers it, and she takes it and swallows.
Mr. Mackey's office. A crowd of people is gathered in there with Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey
Oh oh okay? Let's try to calm down, n'kay? This type of thing happens all the time.
Sharon
What do ya mean?! How often does an entire third-grade class go missing?!
Mr. Mackey
Well, 99% of the time, when a child is missing, it's because they've run away. M'kay?
The parents gasp.
Sharon
Run away?
Sheila
[Fretfully.] Oy, I knew I shouldn't have made Kyle eat that gefukahukah.
Randy
How do we get our runaway children back?
Mr. Mackey
Well, we just need to make some posters, nkay? Hand out brochures, onkay? That way, the public can know what the chldren look like and can call in if thry're spotted, m'kay?
Sharon
Let's get started right away! They could be halfway to L. A. by now.
Sheila
It's only a matter of time before they're selling their bodies and buying smack.
About town. An insistent tune plays. Posters of the missing kids are going up everywhere. Gerald pins a picture of Kyle on a tree, and Randy tapes one of Stan on a light post.
Man 1
Come on, everybody!
Man 2
We've got to find those kids!
Man 1
If we all put our heads together, we can find them!
Man 2
We can do it!
Liane is in a bikini passing out pictures of Eric. This draws men, young and old, from all around.
Man 3
Hi.
On a wall are pictures of, from left to right, Bebe, Clyde, Stan, Kyle, Macaulay Culkin, Pip,...
Midnight on the precipice. The bus rocks slowly and with a loud thud.
Stan
What was that?
Kyle
What was what?
Stan
Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
Kyle
What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
Kenny
(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
Kyle
Hey yeah, I remember that.
Kenny
(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)
Kenny's Tale: from Death. The boys are running down the street, Death pursues them, and Grandpa Marsh pursues Death.
The Boys
Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
Death is following the kids on a tricycle, while Grandpa Marsh is trying to keep up with Death on his electric wheelchair.
Grandpa Marsh
Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
The Boys
Aaaah!
Kyle
[Sees Death close to Kenny.] Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Grandpa
Come over here you son of a whore!
Everyone passes the electronics store without stopping to see Terrance and Phillip. Death is about to touch Kenny when Kenny decides to defend his life.
Kenny
(Take... that!)
Kenny flips Death off the trike and starts jumping on him. Death starts coming apart.
Kenny
(You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!)
Kyle and Stan return to watch.
Stan
Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
Kyle
You... bastard?
Kenny reaches into Death's corpse, pulls out a strawberry ice cream cone, and starts licking.
Kenny
(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!)
The kids laugh.
Stan
Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
Kenny
(Oh, yeah.)
Kyle
Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right?
The roof rips open and the scary monster reaches in and gropes for someone. Butters jumps for the front window, and Pip and Craig try to open their windows.
Kids
AAAAH!
Kid
MOMMY!
The monster's claw settles on Kenny and pulls him out.
Kenny
[Gasps.] (Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!)
The monster scurries away, holding Kenny tight.
Stan
Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!
Kyle
You bastard!
Stan watches as Kenny and the monster disappear.
Stan
Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
Cartman looks out through the gaping hole in the roof.
Cartman
Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
Back at The Tonight Show, Ms. Crabtree's segment has just started.
Ms. Crabtree
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ALL STARIN' AT?!
The audience laughs.
Ms. Crabtree
STOP LAUGHING, YOU WHORES!!
More laughs.
Ms. Crabtree
I SAID, SHUT UP!!
The audience is hushed, then roars with laughter again. She stays quiet and walks off stage.
Jay Leno
Let's hear it for Ms. Crabtree. What an up-and-comer!
Truck Driver
Well. That was great, ma'am.
Ms. Crabtree
Was it? Does it even matter?
Truck Driver
Wwhat do ya mean?
Ms. Crabtree
Success is hollow, Mitch, hollow like a dead tree. I think it's time for me to give it up.
Truck Driver
Are you sure?
Ms. Crabtree
Ah-I'm sure. Let's get a cup of coffee.
They walk off. Meanwhile it's daytime, and the sun is shining into the bus through the roof.
Cartman
I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again?
The kids shiver.
Kyle
We've just gotta stick together.
Stan
Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
Cartman
Hay, wait a minute.
Stan
What?
Cartman
Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
Happy Days' Tale: Arnold's at night. Every kid of driving age shows up to see Fonzie jump the buses. Two of his many admiring girls get him ready for the jump, then walk away. The Fonz revs up the bike.
Joanie Cunningham
Go, Fonzie!
Fonzie
Eeeeyyyy!
The Fonz strikes a pose and gives a thumbs up.
Cartman
You can do it, Fonzie.
Stan
We believe in you, Fonz.
Fonzie
Eeeeyyyy!
The Fonz revs up his motorcycle and heads for the ramp. He passes it and turns around, does a wheelie, and goes for the jump. He sails over the buses and lands. He gets close to the crowd and loses control. Everybody but Kenny gets out of the way.
Kenny
(Hey, that freakin' bike-!)
Fonzie's bike smashes him into the brick wall and bounces off, and Fonzie sails over the wall. After a moment, Kenny drops, and Fonzie gets up behind the wall.
Fonzie
[Triumphantly.] Eeyy!
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a chocolate ice cream cone, then starts licking.
Stan
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Cartman
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.
Stan
You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
Kyle
Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
Cartman
[Thinks.] Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense.
As he turns around, the bus lurches again.
Stan
Oh no!
The bus teeters.
Kids
Aaaah!
Kyle
What are we gonna do?
Kids
[Running around.] Aaaah!
Nighttime arrives, and Kyle looks out the back window as the kids move around. Clyde and Red run to the front, and Craig runs from the front door to the seat behind the driver.
Stan
Now we need more weight in the back.
Red and Clyde run back, and the third kid runs back to the door.
Stan
No, that's too much!
Clyde and Red run to the front, but stop halfway. The front of the bus drops back to the ground.
Kyle
There. [Drops into his seat.] I think we got it.
Stan
I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
Kyle
Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
Cartman
It does?
Kyle
Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
The Ensign's Tale: Two nights ago. The kid in the red shirt decides not to wait for help to come, but to go and look for help himself.
Boy In The Red Shirt
Ehah! Well, I'm not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I'll send help.
Kyle
Don't do it, kid.
The kid hops off the bus and the rest of the class goes over to the left side of the bus to see him off.
Stan
Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster.
The boy turns around and smiles. The bushes behind him rustle. The kids look stunned as the monster comes out of the trees and traps the boy.
Dialog
Boy In The Red Shirt
Nooooo-agh!
The monster picks him up and swallows him whole.
Kyle
Holy crap, dude!
The monster pulls out a spoon and some ice cream to enjoy with his meal.
Kyle
Hey look! He's got ice cream!
Kyle and Stan smile.
Kids
Hooray! Yea!
The roof opens up.
Kids
Aaah!
Cartman smiles, and ice cream cones start dropping in for the kids to catch.
Kids
Yea! Ha ha.
The kids enjoy the treats.
Kyle
Now, that's what I call a sticky situation.
The kids laugh.
A marsh. Ms. Crabtree and the truck driver are enjoying a quiet moment.
Ms. Crabtree
Wow, this is gorgeous. I don't think I've ever seen anything so beautiful.
Truck Driver
From a distance, this place looks like a cold, damp marsh. But once you get inside it...
They look at each other.
Truck Driver
...you realize that it has an inner beauty, far surpassing others.
He hugs her a little tighter.
Truck Driver
Thank you for sharing your time with me, Ms. Crabtree.
Ms. Crabtree
Please. Call me Muffin.
Truck Driver
I'm having a nice time, Muffin.
Ms. Crabtree
Me too, Marcus. I've forgotten all about my cares in the world.
The precipice. All her cares are still waiting for someone to rescue them.
Cartman
Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.
Kyle
Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
Stan
Hey yeah!
Cartman hops down, goes to the driver's seat, and turns on the TV. After a second or two, News 4 pops up.
Tom
...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away. Tonight, a very special message from the parents of some runaway children, in hopes that their young will hear their cries.
Randy
Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.
Stan looks glum.
Randy
Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message.
Music begins, and Randy sings passionately.
Randy
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold

Kyle
[Pointing at Stan.] Du-hude! Your dad's a retard!
Stan looks embarrassed. On TV, Gerald steps up to the mic.
Gerald
Please come home, Kyle.
Now Kyle looks glum.
Gerald
You left home lookin' for somethin' new.

Kyle is really embarrassed.
Gerald
But all you need is right here waitin' for you

The kids laugh at Kyle.
The Parents
Runaway, come home. We love you just as you are.
Runaway, come home. We're sorry things went this far.

There are twelve adults present: The Marshes, the Broflovskis, the McCormicks, Liane Cartman, Mr. Garrison, Kevin's mother, and three unidentified adults.
Stan
Dude, did it ever occur to them to just look for us?
Clyde
I hope my dad doesn't sing.
Cartman
Hey! Do you guys remember the time I found out who my father was?
Stan
Boy, do I!
Cartman's Tale: from Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut. All the men are gathered at Mephesto's room in Hell's Pass Hospital. The boys and Liane are also there.
Mephesto
Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... John Elway.
All gasp. Congratulatory music plays.
Cartman
Sweeeeeett! [Smiles big.]
John Elway
Uh oh.
Cartman
This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father!
He starts a little cheer.
Cartman
My father is John Elway,
My father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun.

John Elway comes over to Cartman.
John Elway
Come on, son. I'll buy you some ice cream.
Cartman looks up lovingly at his purported father, and they walk away. Curiously, Liane Cartman is left behind.
Cartman
Now, that's what I call a sti-
Kyle
Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
Cartman
What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts!
He hops off his seat, and the bus heaves. He makes his way to the back.
Stan
Cartman, no!
The bus starts to tip over.
Kids
Aaaaaa!
Stan
The bus is going over!
Kyle
Oh no!
Kids
[All hurrying to the front.] Aaaaa. Aaaaaaa.
Craig tries to hang on to a seat, but loses his grip and falls through the back window screaming. The bus snaps in two, and the front end comes down. A second later, both parts of the bus slip into the steep canyon.
Kids
Aaaaa!
The scene is shown again, but this time the bus falls into a giant bucket of Super Chocolaty Chunky Funk Chip Surprise Ice Cream. The kids are strewn all over the place once again.
Stan
[He and Kyle get up and look out the window] Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
Kids
Hooray!
Cartman
Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-
Cartman's bedroom. Cartman snaps out of a vivid dream and sits up.
Cartman
Deah, eh eh. [Sweats.] Oh man, what a weird dream!
Liane appears at his door with milk and a bowl.
Liane
Ah-are you okay, hon?
Cartman
Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream.
Liane
Oh. Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast?
Beetles start crawling out of the bowl.
Cartman
Yes, please.
Liane snaps up the first beetle the leaves the bowl and eats it.
Liane
Mmmm.
Cartman
Mmmm. [Munch munch gobble.] Mmmm.
Liane
Mmmm. Beetles are good with ice cream.
Stan's bedroom. Stan is asleep.
Stan
GAAA-uh.
Stan is now wide awake, as he sits up.
Stan
Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare.
He reaches for the phone and dials a number.
Kyle
[Already up, reaches for the phone.] Hello?
Stan
Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.
Kyle
Really?
Stan
Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
Kyle
Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
Stan
Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
Kyle
Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
Stan
Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later.
He hangs up, hops off the bed and leaves.
The marsh. Cartman's dream has a life of its own and is self-aware, like a holodeck program gone awry. A frog croaks.
Ms. Crabtree
I want to thank you for making me feel alive again, Marcus.
Truck Driver
Ms. Crabtree?
Ms. Crabtree
What is it? What's wrong?
Truck Driver
You realize I can't stay. None of this is real: it's... it's all been a little eight-year old's dream.
Ms. Crabtree
Oh I know. I know, Marcus. But let me just pretend as long as I can.
Truck Driver
Sure.
He hugs her a bit tighter, and they stare off into the horizon, at a very red sunset.
"Runaway, Come Home" plays.

South Park Elementary. In the final hour of the school year...
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?
The kids stay silent.
Mr. Garrison
Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!
Mr. Garrison pounds his desk in frustration.
Mr. Garrison
The prank is over!
He pounds his desk again. The kids sit still.
Mr. Garrison
You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch.
He starts waiting. Soon he grimaces, then he taps his thumbs together, then taps them faster.
Mr. Garrison
God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!
He pounds his desk hard and the apple bounces away. The dismissal bell rings.
Kids
Yea--
Mr. Garrison
Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!
Kids
Awww..!
Mr. Garrison
Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!
Mr. Garrison turns to face the board.
Mr. Garrison
Okay. I'm going to turn around now.
Mr. Garrison turns back toward the classroom, to find that all the kids except for Pip have left.
Mr. Garrison
Shit!
Pip
Where did everybody go?
Outside. The kids bolt through the school's front door.
Kids
Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!
The snow melts away, and a mound of it reveals a boy whose missing person's poster was in the back of the class. He gets up, and his parents rush up to meet him.
Mother
Oh golly, Kevin, honey.
Father
Good to see you again, son.
The boys walk past a house where a man inhales in the warm breeze.
Man
Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready.
He uses a chainsaw on the tree in front of the house. Trees all over the area are coming down.
A park, and kids are at play already. The boys walk through and meet Pip along the way.
Pip
Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!
Stan
Shut up, Pip.
Pip
Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?
Kyle
What do you mean?
Pip
Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead.
Cartman
Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!
The boys laugh at him and walk away.
The boys walk past a sign reading "Stu's Fireworks" with an arrow pointing right.
Stan
Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.
Kyle
I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
Stan
I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
Kyle
Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
Cartman
Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!
Stan
Jesus, Cartman!
Cartman
[Mumbles.] Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.
Stu's Firework Shack.
Stu
Hi, fellas.
Boys
Hi, Stu.
Stu
What can I do for you?
Kyle
We wanna buy M-80s.
Stan
The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
Cartman
Okay, that's it!
Kenny laughs.
Cartman
Screw you guys! I'm going home.
Cartman walks off.
Kyle
What a baby.
Stan
So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.
Stu
I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?
Stan
Heard what?
Stu
All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.
Kyle
What do ya mean?
Stu
It was in the paper this morning.
Headline: "North Park Kid Loses Hands in Firecracker Accident". The picture shows the armless boy with scars on his cheeks and a dismembered hand on the floor.
Kyle
Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
Stu
Right.
Stan
How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
Kyle
Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
Flashback. Kyle remembers their days as toddlers. All four stand in a hallway holding lit firecrackers. Kyle tosses one up in the air and it pops. Kenny holds on to his, to his peril. It pops, and Kenny's head flies off his torso. The rest of the body falls over.
Stan
Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
Kyle
Oo bastards!
Rats pile on the corpse and nibble away.
Stan
A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
Kyle
Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
Stu pulls out a fireworks box and takes something out.
Stu
I can still sell snakes.
Stu lights one up, sets it down, and watches it grow.
Stan/Kyle/ Kenny
Awww..!
Meanwhile, over at City Hall, Mayor McDaniels is on the phone with someone.
Mayor McDaniels
This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake. [Listens.] I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call. [Switch.] Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems! [Switch.] Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smart-ass, I was being ironic..! [Hangs up.]
Officer Barbrady
[Emerging from under her desk.] I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, keep looking. [Pushes him down.]
Officer Barbrady
Oh?
Mayor McDaniels
This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
Officer Barbrady
[From under the desk.] Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow.
Mayor McDaniels
Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa-- [Swoons.] Oooooogh...
Officer Barbrady
I found him.
Bus Stop. The boys (still wearing coats) stand still, completely oblivious.
Stan
Man, it's hot out here.
Cartman
What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
Kyle
Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
Stan
I know! Let's go sledding!
Kyle
Yeah!
Top of a hill. The boys have brought their sled, and Cartman is left to go on.
Stan
Come on, Cartman, get on.
Cartman
Stan?
Kyle
Let's go, dude. We're ready.
Stan
What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
Cartman
Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
Kyle
Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
Cartman
Ugh... Whatever.
He hops on. The sled goes down just a bit, then stops.
Stan
What the hell is going on?
Jimbo and Ned drive by in their Hummer.
Jimbo
Hey there, boys!
Stan
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
Jimbo
How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
Kyle
Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
Jimbo
What?!
Stan
Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
Jimbo
Oh my God! [Revs up.] Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case. [Drives off.] Buckle your seat belt, Ned.
Ned
Mmmm-where are we going?
Jimbo
México, my amigo.
Ned
Mmmm-why are we going to México?
Jimbo
To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?
Ned
Are fireworks legal in Mexico?
Jimbo
Hell, everything's legal in México. It's the American way.
Jimbo drives through mountains in the distance.
Back at City Hall, the Mayor is holding a meeting. A man is shown with an easel and a large notebook.
Charlie
At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while--
Mayor McDaniels
Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
Charlie
Oh, o-kay. [To himself.] Let's see...
He turns the pages up and over. Page 1: Dyno Might Safe and Spicy; Section 1: Introduction; Section 2: Safety Features; Section 3: We Value the Customer... Now to design specifications.
Charlie
Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake.
Mayor McDaniels
Ooooh!
Charlie
We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.
Mayor McDaniels
[Writes notes.] Comanche helicopters...
Charlie
[Flips page.] Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time.
Mayor McDaniels
...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time...
Charlie flips the page. A giant smiling snake is shown rising out of the disk.
Charlie
Once lit, the snake will grow.
He turns the page and vaudevillian Abe Vigoda is shown.
Charlie
And good times will be had by all.
The Mayor and her aides clap.
Aide 1
Wonderful.
Aide 2
Spectacular.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!
Aide 1
Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
Aide 2
Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?
Mayor McDaniels
Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!
On the side of a road. The boys are building a snowman, but out of mud. A mudman.
Kyle
[Singing.]
Dusty the dirtball...

Stan
Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
Kyle
Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Hello, children. How is your summer going?
Stan
Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
Kyle
Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat.
Stan
That's good.
Long pause.
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
Kyle
Yup.
Long pause.
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Hat isn't real.
Stan
Right.
Long pause. Mr. Garrison walks away.
Cartman
Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?
Kenny, Stan and Kyle laugh at him.
Stan
Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
Cartman
It is not!
Stan
Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
Kyle
Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee.
Cartman
I am not swimming around in pee!
Stan
Whatever, dude.
Cartman
My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday.
Kyle
[Grins with Stan.] Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.
Cartman
I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
Stan
But Cartman, we're trying to--
Cartman
Uh, screw you guys. Home. [Leaves.]
Stan
What does he mean, "living in denial"?
Kyle
Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
Stan hops up to put a carrot on the mudman as a nose.
Stan
There, how does that look?
Kyle
Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
Stan
Uh, crap..!
Community Pool. Kids are swimming and diving, and a lifeguard looks over the scene. Cartman, however dips his toes into the water and shudders.
Cartman
Eh-eh-eh-eh...
He backs away as the instructor blows her whistle.
Instructor
Okay kids, everyone in the pool!
The kids jump in.
instructor
Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now.
Cartman
Nuh-uh.
Instructor
Just jump in.
Cartman
I don't wanna.
Instructor
It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it.
Cartman holds his breath, covers his nose and jumps in.
Cartman
Egh--
He comes up and treads water. Cartman splutters.
Instructor
There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us.
Cartman
Huh? First graders?
They swim by, but stop to look at him. Yellow pools of pee appear in front of them. They swim away.
Cartman
Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!
South Park. Stark's Pond. Bleachers are being set up for the Fourth of July picnic, and a chili and doughnut stand goes up.
Mayor McDaniels
Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
Aide 2
I'm sure it'll be here any second.
Mayor McDaniels
Shut up!
Aide 2
Copy that.
Meanwhile, at a stage where the children of South Park Elementary are practicing The Stars and Stripes...
Conductor
Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman?
Stan
He's taking swimming lessons.
Conductor
Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And...
They start playing the scale (F# first), but everyone is playing out of key, creating a god-awful mix of noises.
Conductor
Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's Symphony No. 5.
They try, but it is yet another god-awful mix of noises.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.
She see something.
Mayor McDaniels
Wait a minute... It's the snake!
The snake appears over the mountain transported by the three Comanche helicopters. Everyone stops to watch.
Officer Barbrady
Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all.
Mayor McDaniels
Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!
Mexico. Jimbo and Ned pass by a store that sells cohetes. They stop and walk back to it.
Jimbo
Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr.
Proprietor
¿Qué?
Jimbo
Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr.
Proprietor
¿Necesita usted un cohete grande?
Ned
Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr.
The proprietor pulls out a large box and places it on the counter.
Jimbo
Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone.
Ned
Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr.
Jimbo
Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July.
He and Ned take a rocket each.
Jimbo
We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
Ned
Hmmm-bueyno.
Mr. Garrison's house. Garrison is on his chair, looking at the TV tensely. Then the telephone rings...
Mr. Garrison
Hello?
Caller (Mr. Mackey)
Hello, is Mr. Hat there?
Mr. Garrison
Is this some kind of joke?
Caller (Mr. Mackey)
[snickers] Yes.
Mr. Garrison
You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
Caller (Mr. Mackey)
I don't think you can, m'kay.
Mr. Garrison hangs up.
Mr. Garrison
Goddammit..!
He turns on the TV to PBS, when Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop are on.
Shari Lewis
So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today?
Lamb Chop
Well, I'd like to sing you a song.
Shari
Hey, let's sing one to-gether!
Lamb Chop
As long as we're together,
we can do anything
We can take on the whole darn world
We're happy as clams,
with plenty of pearls
Through thick and thin,
we've always been to-geth-er...

Mr. Garrison descends into madness as the song progresses, until he imagines himself going to her studio.
Shari
Whoa-aagghh! Aagghh! Aggh!
Mr. Garrison approaches, and with a small ax, chops off Lamb Chop from Shari's hand and tosses it onto a lit barbecue grill. Flames rise up and engulf Lamb Chop.
Shari
No! Lamb Chop, no!
Lamb Chop
Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..!
Mr. Garrison is shown smiling away on his armchair, having dreamed out his anger.
Meanwhile, over at the Community Pool. The swimming instructor has five swimmers in front of her at the deep end, and Cartman stands alone at the shallow end.
Instructor
Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later.
Cartman
Later's fine.
Instructor
Just do your side stroke.
Cartman
I only know how to do it doggie style.
Instructor
That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!
Cartman
Can I do it doggie style?
Instructor
Okay.
Cartman starts paddling towards her.
Instructor
That's it! That's it, you can do it!
Cartman
Sweet..!
Three first graders swim by, leaving yellow trails. That stops him.
Cartman
Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!
Instructor
Come on, Eric!
Cartman
No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
News 4. Our top story tonight...
Anchor
Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name.
Creamy Goodness
Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history.
Some of the folks have picnic blankets set out and many are mugging for the camera.
Creamy Goodness
Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us.
So it is said, so it is done.
Creamy Goodness
Alrighty then, looks like we're ready.
Orchestra stage. Everyone is present and ready to play.
Stan
How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
Cartman
Fine.
Kyle
I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
Cartman
Well, you heard wrong, hippie!
A wide view of Stark's Pond and everyone in the area around it. Then, the mayor is on the main stage with her aides about to address the crowd.
Mayor McDaniels
Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!
Conductor
This is it. And a-one and a-two and a...
The kids begin to play, and the result is as bad as in practice. The audience members are covering their ears.
Audience
Ooohhhh..!
Mayor McDaniels
What is fuck is that?!
Aide 2
I think it's The Stars and Stripes.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, hell. Light the snake!
Everyone cheers. About 57 people with flamethrowers step forward and fire up the snake.
Audience
Ooooooh!
The snake begins to bulge.
Audience
Ahhhhh!
The Mayor is pleased with success.
Mexico; night. Jimbo and Ned are almost close to the border.
Jimbo:
Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking.
Ned says nothing. Jimbo laughs.
Jimbo
I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?
Jimbo laughs some more. They arrive at the Border. Jimbo and Ned drive up. The border guard greets them.
Guard
Good evening, gentlemen.
Jimbo
Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland.
Guard
Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions.
Jimbo
Fire away, we have nothing to hide.
Guard
Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
Jimbo
No, sir.
Guard
Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
Jimbo
Yes. [Ned recoils.] I mean, no! No!
The gurad brings out his flashlight and turns it on.
Guard
Open your trunk, please, sir.
He moves toward the trunk.
Jimbo
Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
Stark's Pond. The crowds are still cheering and the band is still playing, and the snake is still growing. Cartman intently turns a page at his sheet music.
Mayor McDaniels
My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity.
The snake is still growing, and the Mayor frowns.
Mayor McDaniels
Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?
Charlie
Die out?
Mayor McDaniels
Yes, you know, expire, end.
Long pause. Charlie looks up and back.
Mayor McDaniels
Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
Charlie
Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big.
The snake keeps growing.
Charlie
I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?
Mayor McDaniels
What?!
Kyle
[Looking up.] Dude! That thing is huge!
Stan
Yeah, they need to shut it off.
Cartman
[Distracted.] Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!
The crowd becomes nervous as well as awed.
Man 1
Somebody stop it!
Man 2
It's out of control!
Everyone runs away screaming as the snake starts to bend, then part of the snake falls off.
Stan/Kyle/ Cartman
Aarrgghh!!
All the children jump off the stage. Kenny, however...
Kyle
Kenny! Watch out!
The piece of the snake hits the stage.
Kenny
(Waarrggh!!)
Kenny jumps clear and lands under the bleachers.
Kenny
(Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!)
The snake mows down the bleachers, crushing Kenny.
Stan
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastard!
Mayor McDaniels
[Horrified.] Oh my God! [Grabs Charlie.] You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!
Charlie
Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes... [Mutters indistinctly.]
Mayor McDaniels
So when does it run out?!
Charlie
November. Of next year.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, hell..!
People are running and screaming away from the snake. Kyle picks up a violin and starts playing a dirge. Stan returns and looks at him, then takes up his own violin. Cartman, Bill, Fosse, and Token join in and take up their instruments; and they all start playing "Nearer My God To Thee" in tune.
July 5th, 6 a.m., Stark's Pond. News 4 coverage resumes.
Creamy Goodness
Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work.
Tom
Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future.
The snake is now some thirty feet wide and moving down South Park's main thoroughfare, incinerating everything in its path.
Stan
Man, this sucks.
Kyle
What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!
Stan
We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
Cartman
Where is Chef?
Somewhere, in the Caribbean, Chef is singing to three waitresses, one of them holding a phone.
Chef
[Slowly.]
Baby, you know you're the girl for me-ee
And all that I want to be-ee-ee is...
[Quickly.]
You and me
And her; simultaneous
You and me, and you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three; simultaneous
Ooh, that's right...

[The phone rings and Chef answers it.] Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what?... A giant snake?... Killing everybody?!... Growing bigger?!... Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, fudge ya. [He hangs up and resumes singing.]

Simultaneous, you and me
And you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three...

South Park. The smoke is heavy in the air. Stan hangs up the phone.
Kyle
What'd he say?
Stan
Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
Cartman
Wow.
Kyle
How is that gonna help?
National News, on the U.S. map behind the anchor, the snake is shown having separated into four snakes. The first has gone through the Northwest and backtracked into Canada. The second has gone into the Great Plains and is headed for the East Coast. The third has gone down into Texas and the South, and the fourth has gone through the Southwest and is now in Northern Mexico.
Anchor
All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen.
Utah, Mormons are gathered for a baptism at a river.
Preacher
Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you.
The preacher dunks the catechumen into the river.
Assistant
From this day on, all will be well.
The new member pops up.
New Mormon
I already feel like things are getting better.
Snake One comes and engulfs them all.
New York.
Mr. Garrison
And I can't sleep or think...
Inside a psychiatrist's office, Mr. Garrison lies on a couch.
Mr. Garrison
Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
Dr. Katz
Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went?
Mr. Garrison
How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?
Dr. Katz
Well… I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah.
Mr. Garrison
At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning.
Dr. Katz
Um... Ahem...
Long pause.
Dr. Katz
Are you gay?
Mr. Garrison
What?!
Dr. Katz
[Stammers.] It-it's j-just-- It's just a question.
Mr. Garrison
Are you propositioning me?
Dr. Katz
No.
Mr. Garrison
Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!
Dr. Katz
Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you.
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Hat, on the other hand...
Dr. Katz
Mr. Hat was gay?
Mr. Garrison
Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
Dr. Katz
I see.
Mr. Garrison
Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.
Dr. Katz
That I did not need to know.
Mr. Garrison
Well, I'm just sayin'.
Mr. Katz
Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet.
Mr. Garrison doesn't say anything.
Dr. Katz
What do you think about that?
Mr. Garrison
I think you're the loony one in this room.
Snake Two bounds over several buildings, knocking them off their foundations. It smashes through the window and burns Dr. Katz to the bone.
Mr. Garrison
Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo.
Meanwhile, inside a Texas prison, Jimbo and Ned share a cell.
Jimbo
Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again.
Ned
Mmmmmmm-yup.
Jimbo
Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
Ned
Mmm-well better luck next year.
Jimbo
Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again.
Ned
[Reads cue card.] Mmmm-is anyone other than the two of you riding in this vehicle?
Jimbo
No.
Ned
Mmmm-do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
Jimbo
[Hesitantly.] Yes?
Ned shakes his head.
Jimbo
Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?
Snake Three makes its way to the prison and smashes through the wall of their cell. Jimbo is startled.
Jimbo
Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
Ned
Mmm-it looks like my ex-wife!
Jimbo
Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!
Green Bay, Wisconsin. Sports Spa. Brett Favre enters and removes his shirt, but keeps his towel on. Mr. Hat is already seated on the lower bench.
Brett Favre
Hi. I hasn't seen you in here before.
Mr. Hat blinks and looks at him.
City Hall. The coverage continues.
Reporter
As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000...
A tree inexplicably falls over.
Reporter
...people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers.
The hall doors open and the Mayor's aides step forward.
Reporter
...And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now.
Aide 1
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she is... sick.
Reporter 2
"Sick"?! What kind of lame excuse is that?
Print Reporter
You gotta be kidding me!
Reporter 3
Oh, this is ridiculous!
Reporter 4
Come on, we want answers.
Aide 2
Sh-she's having her period.
The reporters fall silent. Reporter 3 gasps quietly.
Reporter 4
[Softly.] Oh.
Aide 1
We do, however, have an official statement for all the concerned cities about the matter with the giant snake that we can't seem to put out.
Aide 2 pulls out a statement and reads it.
Aide 2
"We're sorry. Our bad."
Aide 1
Thank you, that is all.
They turn around and go back into City Hall. The reporters are left grousing.
Meanwhile at the Community Pool. Notice reads:
POOL CLOSED
Due to Hazardous
SNAKE FIREWORK

Cartman is all alone in the swimming pool.

Cartman
Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.
He starts swimming to the deep end.
Cartman
Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it.
From his view. The diving board is getting closer and closer.
Meanwhile, in outer space, the snakes can be seen growing longer and longer across the face of the nation.
Back at Stark's Pond, the disk is still producing the snake. Stan and Kyle sit under a tree with nothing to do, and next to them a man rests on a poster with a message: "Repent - The end is here".
Stan
How many days left in summer?
Kyle
A lot, I think.
Stan
Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
Kyle
I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon.
Jimbo and Ned arrive.
Jimbo
Buenos gracias, boys.
Stan
Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
Jimbo
Oh, now, why the long faces?
Kyle
We're bored.
Stan
There's nothin' to do.
Jimbo
Well, I don't think those are problems...
Jimbo
Jimbo
...that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
Stan/Kyle
Hooray!
Jimbo
Careful with those, now, those are dangerous.
Stan and Kyle set up the rockets and Jimbo lights them. The rockets are as big as the boys.
Jimbo
Point 'em away from your eyes, now.
Kyle
Wow! These are huge!
Jimbo
Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child.
The rockets are launched and they head for the snake. Upon impact, the snake falls apart, and the base of it loses its fire. Ash now rains down upon everyone.
Stan
Hey, look! We blew up the snake!
Everyone cheers.
Citizen
All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out.
Jimbo
Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!
Stan/Kyle
Hooray!
A crowd begins to gather, meanwhile, back at the community pool, Cartman has almost reached his goal.
Cartman
I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.
He touches the wall at the 9½ foot mark.
Cartman
I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
Instructor
[Off-screen.] The snake's been destroyed. [Removes notice.] The pool's open!
Cartman
Huh?
All the first graders jump into the pool, the water turns yellow in a matter of seconds.
Cartman
Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!
He makes his way out along the edge of the pool.
Stark's Pond.
Citizen 2
Look! They put out the snake!
Everyone cheers.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly.
Ned, Jimbo, Stan and Kyle look at her.
Kyle
Hey, look! It's snowing!
The others, and the crowd, look and ponder.
Jimbo
Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell.
Clyde, Annie, Red, and Token, cheer, and dance around in the ash.
The mountains are now capped in ash. Stan and Kyle work on an ash man, and Pip is singing with his family once again. (His parents are not dead.) Clyde and another kid take a sled down an ash drift.
Stan
Winter's back!
Mr. Garrison walks up with Mr. Twig, his new puppet which is a stick with a little purple shirt with a pink triangle on it.
Mr. Garrison
Wow, it's a black blizzard!
Kyle
Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig.
Mr. Twig
That's right, children. I'll see you in the fall.
Stan
Well, I can hardly wait.
South Park, a few days later, Chef drives up and steps out of his car.
Chef
Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..?
Before him, some kids play on ash-covered ground. They are pretty much in blackface. Cartman has joined Stan and Kyle in working on the ashman.
Stan
Hey, Chef!
Cartman
How's it going?
Chef looks left. A couple is clearing out ash from the main street.
Man
Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation?
Long pause.
Chef
Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!
End Credits. "Simultaneous Lovin'" plays.

Sundance Film Festival. A small Western town. Bustling sounds are heard as the camera slowly pans down. A crowd streams by in the background behind a sports car and limo, and front and center are Robert Redford and a woman.
Robert Redford
Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded.
Phyllis
Because. People from L.A. love to come to a quaint little mountain town for a few days, and this gives them an excuse.
Robert Redford
No, this used to be a quaint little mountain town. Now look at it. Sushi restaurants, upscale clothes stores, $25 parking, Liam Neeson... I tell you, Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's resources out. We must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again.
Phyllis
That's not a bad idea. But where?
South Park. Winter is indeed back. A man hums as he arrives at the town flag pole with a purple flag and runs it up to the top. It unfurls, revealing: 1st Annual South Park Film Festival. A crowd instantly pours in and mills about.
Man in background
Ching ching cha-ching.
Man in foreground
Whoa.
South Park Elementary.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?
Mr. Twig
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First Annual South Park Film Festival begins today.
Wendy
Wow! Cool!
Kyle
They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?
Mr. Garrison
Nono, Kyle. These are independent films.
Stan
Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too.
Cartman
No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
Wendy
No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
Cartman
Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!
Wendy
Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!
Cartman
I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
Wendy
Hrmph!
Mr. Garrison
Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!
Cartman looks around for a second.
Cartman
...bitch.
Mr. Garrison
That's it Eric, you-!
Cartman
I'm going!
He hops off his chair and walks out, closing the door behind him.
Mr. Garrison
Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it.
The class groans.
Mr. Garrison
The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love.
Stan
Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
There's certainly a lot of people now. Two of them are talking on cell phones.
Director 1
Norma, I want to shoot the script next month with Demi Moore instead.
Director 2
[In shorts!] Well you can tell Spielberg he can kiss my ass!
Mayor McDaniels
[Walking about with one of her aides.] Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city.
After school and the kids are out in the town.
Cartman
I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
Stan
She's not my girlfriend.
Kenny
(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.)
Cartman and Kyle laugh.
Kyle
Sick, Kenny.
Stan
Damn, dude. Look at all these people.
Director 3
[Rushing by with a cell phone.] I'm late for a screening, I'll call you from the theater.
Kyle
All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
They come upon a stand that says
CHEF'S
SOUL FOOD
Chef
Hello there, children!
The boys
Hey, Chef.
Stan
Whatcha doin'?
Chef
Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!
Cartman
What kind of cookies?
Stan
Calm down, tubby.
Chef
They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, "Fudge 'Ems".
Chef pulls out a box with that name on them.
Cartman
I wanna Fudge 'Em.
Chef
I can just see the commercial now. "Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."
Kyle
Cool!
Chef
And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, "Fudge This."
Director 3
[Passing by with his date.] Oh look, one of the natives is selling local food wares... how quaint.
Woman
This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture.
Chef
Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, "Go Fudge Yourself," or my all-natural, "I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."
Woman
Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?
Chef
Huh?
Director 3
I would kill for some cous cous right now.
Chef
Whose goose?
Woman
Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A.
Director 3
Cute sign, though.
The couple leaves, and Chef looks confused. Wendy walks up.
Wendy
Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?
Cartman
[Taunting.] Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?
Stan
Shut up, Cartman! [To Wendy.] Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. [They walk away.]
Cartman
She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
Kyle
If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
Chef
Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! "I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"
Cartman
[To Kyle.] Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.
At the Bijou, South Park's movie theater. Now playing: Witness To Denial. Stan sits in the front row with Wendy.
Stan
When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
Wendy
Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.
Stan
They what?!
The projectionist starts the film. Only the right half of a woman is shown in close-up. The sound is overmodulated.
Candice
Who are you to judge my womanly soul?
Her girlfriend appears far in the background.
Candice
The Goddess flames that burn in my memory aren't dark. Dare you call them dark!
They switch places. The girlfriend's left side appears in close-up.
Candice
Here lies the Goddess truth of my body.
Stan
[With soda and popcorn.] Oh, brother.
Candice
The Goddess that cries, "Freedom!"
Her hands cover her mouth.
Candice
Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being
Stan puts his left hand on the arm rest. Wendy reaches for his soda and takes a sip. In a new scene, Candice is talking to her lover, who wears a Lilith Fare shirt.
Candice
You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door.
Candice's Girlfriend
Then make love to me, right now
The two of them embrace and drop out of view.
Stan
Dude!
Wendy
Sshh!
Stan
Dude!
Kyle's house. He's in the restroom crapping away.
Kyle
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way-

Sheila
[From the master bedroom.] Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
Kyle
I'm poopies, ma!
Sheila
Well, hurry up!
Kyle
Gone are the dark clouds that had me-

Mr. Hankey
[Voice only, slowly, with echo.] Ky-yle! Ky-yle!
Kyle looks down into the toilet.
Kyle
Could it be?
Mr. Hankey
[In his shrill voice.] Hooowwwdy ho!
Kyle hops off and looks into the toilet. No poo is seen.
Kyle
Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
Day two of the South Park Film Festival.
Tom
I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens, [Softly.] except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town [Normally.] and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities.
At the Bijou, the boys are watching "The Body Decayeth".
Kyle
It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
Cartman
Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
Kyle
Well, I'm sure it was him.
Man
Look, look! Here comes somebody!
People come closer as a limousine pulls up. Someone steps out.
A woman
Move aside, I can't see.
Tom
Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage.
Fred Savage steps out of the limo wearing a shirt that says, 'I'm Fred Savage'.
Crowd
[In disappointment.] AAWWWW!
Fred's head drops as the limo and crowd scurries away.
Tom
Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon.
Kyle
So how was that movie last night, dude?
Stan
Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
Cartman
It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?
Stan
Yeah, pretty much.
Cartman
Yeah!
Stan
The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen.
Kyle
Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass.
Stan and Kenny laugh.
Cartman
Ay!
Stan
Dude, now that'd be like IMAX.
Kyle and Kenny laugh.
Cartman
Okay, that's enough fat-ass jokes for this week.
Kenny
(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh.)
Stan and Kyle laugh.
Cartman
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home.
Cartman looks around, but doesn't go anywhere.
Kyle
Well?
Cartman
I'm gonna, just give me a minute.
Robert Redford
This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into.
Phyllis
Forgive me for being observant, but, won't we just end up doing the same thing to this town?
Robert Redford
Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles.
Phyllis
Why? Why would we do such a thing?
Robert Redford
Because we have to live in L.A. And if we can't live in quiet, simple, peaceful mountain towns, then nobody will!
He laughs maniacally.
Robert Redford
Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will!
The camera moves in as he laughs maniacally again.
Robert Redford
That's it.
The kids pass by Chef's booth. Cartman is still with them. Now the booth says "Chef's Salty Balls"
Chef
Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, "Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls."
He brings out the cookie tray to show them. The boys say nothing.
Stan
Are they good?
Chef
Try 'em.
Stan
Hey, dude, these are good!
Cartman
Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef.
Kenny laughs at Cartman's unintended double entendre.
Mr. Hankey
[From under the runoff grate.] Ky-yle!
Kyle
There it is again!
Stan and Kyle have traded places.
Stan
There is what again?
Kyle looks left.
Mr. Hankey
[Moaning.] Ky-yle!
Kyle
It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble.
Mr. Hankey's theme song begins to play.
Stan
Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
Kyle
Where does that grill go?
Stan
To the sewer, dude.
Kyle
Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!
He walks off, but stops when no one follows.
Kyle
Come on!
The boys have left, Chef starts to sing.
Chef
Hey, everybody,
have you seen my balls?
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up,
just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em...

The boys are now in the sewer with flashlights in hand. A rat clamors up a pipe and out of view. Spiderwebs are everywhere.
Cartman
Aw, man, smells like ass down here.
Kyle
Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer!
A sound is heard and the boys quickly turn to look.
Stan
What was that?
The beam of his flashlight lands on a rat.
Cartman
Aw, man, let's get out of here!
Kyle
We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey.
They look ahead, only to see something making splashes in the water.
The boys
Aaaaah!
Kenny
(Wait!)
The figure rises and turns, only to reveal itself as a snorkeling human, Mr. Garrison, with him is Mr. Twig.
Kyle
What the hell?
Mr. Garrison removes his mouthpiece.
Stan
Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
Oh uh- hello, children.
Cartman
What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
Mr. Garrison
Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.
Kyle
In a sewer?
Mr. Garrison
Children, do you know how to file a police report?
The boys
No.
Mr. Garrison
Good. See you in school.
He puts his mouthpiece back on and drops into the water. The boys are stunned, but walk forward.
Cartman
This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
Kyle
Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
Cartman
Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home.
Mr. Hankey
The boys turn to see Mr. Hankey rowing in a paper fries tray.
Kyle
Mr. Hankey!
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho, boys.
Kyle
I told you guys he'd be here!
Mr. Hankey
Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht.
Cartman
[Displeased.] Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh.
Mr. Hankey
Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
The boys
Yes.
Mr. Hankey
And usin' dental floss?
The boys
Yes.
Mr. Hankey
And washin' behind your ears?
The boys
Yes.
Cartman
No.
Mr. Hankey coughs.
Kyle
What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
Mr. Hankey
Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home.
Stan
What do you mean?
Mr. Hankey
Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem.
Cartman
[Incredulous.] Oh my God.
Mr. Hankey
These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment.
Kyle
And that's why you got a cold?
Mr. Hankey
That's why, Kyle. That's why.
Stan
Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
Mr. Hankey
There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me.
He coughs some more.
Kyle
Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys.
The boys move off.
Mr. Hankey
Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!
Mr. Hankey rows away. Meanwhile, back at the festival... Playing at the Bijou: "A Bunch Of Gay Cowboys Eating Pudding." Score another one for Cartman. Inside, the festival host stands before the movie audience.
Host
So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears.
Kyle
[Rushing in.] Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
Director 4
Is that Leonardo DiCaprio?
The audience buzzes and cameras flash everywhere, Kyle shields his eyes.
Kyle
Aaahh!
Director 4
Ohuh no, wait, that's not him.
The audience groans.
Kyle
Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
Female director
Excuse me, little boy, what's a "Mr. Hankey"?
Kyle
He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide world, and I don't want him to die.
No reaction from the audience.
Director 3
What a great story-it has everything!
Female director
This could be the next Free Willy.
Director 5
Great pic, son. How much do you want for it?
Kyle
Huh??
Director 6
Does it-uh have to be a talking piece of poo?
The boys just stare.
Director 7
It could be a crime-fighting rabbit. Or a lovable turtle.
Director 4
This could be a great summer movie.
Female director 2
[Rising in the back.] Can we put a mon-key in it?
Director 8
"The Mr. Hankey Stor-" uh is Harrison Ford available for a fall pic?
Director 9
Keanu Reeves.
Director 10
Matt Damon!
Fred Savage
Fred Savage!
The other audience members laugh at the thought, and Fred is miffed.
Director 7
I'd pay a million for this story!
Director 10
I'll pay two.
The rest of the audience descends into conversation.
Kyle
Dude, no one even listened to me.
Stan
Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
One of the directors has pulled Cartman aside.
Director 3
Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right?
Cartman
Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.
Director 3
I want you to do a big-money deal with me.
Cartman
All of us?
Director 3
Mm-we-hell, I can see that you're the real brains of the group. You don't really need those guys, do you?
Cartman
Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
Director 3
Hm-that's great, kid. Let's make a deal.
They walk off. Meanwhile, in front of the library. Robert Redford and Phyllis have something to announce. Of course, the Mayor and her aides are there.
Robert Redford
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for making the First Annual South Park Film Festival a success. We've barely even started and already the festival has seen more attendance than last year's Sundance festival.
The crowd cheers.
Someone in the crowd
Fantastic!
Robert Redford
And I'm very pleased to announce that in honor of the South Park people who have welcomed us, we are going to build a Hollywood Planet restaurant, right here where this library used to stand.
A wrecking ball appears and knocks the building down with one fell swoop.
Crowd
[Gasping.] Ooohhh!
Aide 2
Can they do that?
Mayor McDaniels
They're Hollywood! They can do anything!
Kyle is in the sewer all alone, looking to tell Mr. Hankey the bad news. An organ is heard.
Kyle
Mr. Hankey!
Kyle looks all around and walks.
Kyle
Mr. Hankey?!
Kyle is surprised to see an organ before him, and Mr. Hankey playing vigorously.
Kyle
Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey
[Turns around.] Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho.
Mr. Hankey starts coughing again.
Mr. Hankey
Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?
Kyle
They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
Mr. Hankey
[Droops.] Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin'.
He turns back and starts playing the organ again.
Kyle
[Determined.] We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
Mr. Hankey
Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
Kyle
It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
Mr. Hankey
But I won't last long up above.
Kyle
Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
Mr. Hankey
All right, just let me get my toothbrush.
The Bijou. Wendy and Stan are heading for the ticket booth.
Wendy
Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!
They look up to see "Tom Hanks in: Me & Mr. Hankey".
Stan
Jeez, they made that into a movie already?
Inside, they sit in the first row, middle two seats. On the screen, Tom Hanks is in a hospital with a fever, hand to forehead.
Tom Hanks
Mr. Hankey, I can't go on anymore. I've lost the fight.
Mr. Hankey
[A talking monkey hanging from the curtain.] No, I'm not leaving without you.
The monkey drops down and goes to Tom Hanks' bedside.
Mr. Hankey
We started this together, we're gonna finish it together.
The monkey holds his hand.
Tom Hanks
I always thought death was something glorious, but now I know that it's not.
Stan reaches out for Wendy's hand. Wendy cries, blows her nose into a napkin, and hands it to Stan, who just looks at it.
Director 3
[Sitting in the back with Cartman.] It's going over really well. People are gonna be knocking my door down to get you.
Cartman
Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
Tom Hanks
[Onscreen.] I'll always love you, Mr. Hankey.
Cartman
[Mocking.] I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy.
Kenny waits outside for Stan and Wendy, so he's passing the time with a yo-yo. The doors open and the patrons flood out, crushing Kenny.
Man 1
Oh my God, I found a penny! [Picks it up.]
Man 2
You bastard!
The street. A manhole cover pops up and Kyle comes out with Mr. Hankey.
Kyle
Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
Mr. Hankey
[Looking more frozen than dry.] It sure is -dry up here. [Coughs]
Kyle
Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
Construction is under way at the Hollywood Planet, South Park's "Death Star".
Mayor McDaniels
Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?
Robert Redford
[Arms crossed.] Make it quick.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town.
Robert Redford
Uh-huh.
Mayor McDaniels
Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?
Robert Redford
We have contracts. [He pulls some out.] You try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. But thanks so much for the hard work.
Cartman
[With director 3.] Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!
Marty
Mmp right. Two million, minus your agent's fee, minus your lawyer's fee, minus my fee, and the publicity and taxes taken out, you get three dollars! That's more than most people in your position make, trust me!
Stan
[Happening upon the scene.] Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!
Cartman
I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?
Stan
If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
Chef
[Stopping by.] It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!
His booth is shown.
Chef
I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it.
The town looks just like Sundance at the beginning of the episode.
Stan
So what do we do now?
Chef
There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
Kyle arrives with Mr. Hankey in a shoebox.
Kyle
You guys, we have to hurry!
Stan
Why?
Kyle
Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!
They walk over to Robert Redford.
Kyle
Sir! Sir!
Robert Redford
Not now!
Kyle
I have to show you something.
Kyle presents the box containing Mr. Hankey to Robert Redford.
Kyle
I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
A director
What's this?
Others have started to gather around.
Kyle
I want you guys to all meet my friend.
Kyle removes the lid to the box and rattles the box a bit. When nothing happens, he turns the box over and Mr. Hankey drops out, dry as a bone. The boys gasp.
Robert Redford
That's great, kid. A dried-out lump of shit; very compelling. [To the crowd] Okay, folks, let's move! We've gotta have that sign down in time for the opening tonight!
Kyle
You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.
Mr. Hankey starts coughing and is barely audible, only his right eye opens.
Mr. Hankey
Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.
Kyle draws closer.
Mr. Hankey
Clo-ser.
Kyle moves in further.
Kyle
Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey
There is a-nother Sky-walk-er.
Mr. Hankey dies.
Kyle
Nooohohohohohoho-
Mr. Hankey
Wake up.
Kyle
What is it, Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey
Come clo-ser.
Kyle moves in closer.
Kyle
What is it?
Mr. Hankey
Clo-ser.
Kyle moves even further in.
Kyle
Yes?
Mr. Hankey
Closer!
Kyle is very close.
Mr. Hankey
One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture.
He dies.
Kyle
Nooo!
Flashbacks of Mr. Hankey flood Kyle's mind, including one of the monkey who played Mr. Hankey in the movie.
Voice over
[Singing slowly, mournfully.]
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
He loved me, I loved you.
Therefore vicariously he loved you-

Kyle
Nooo!
HazMat official
I'm sorry, son. Let's get him to ICU.
The HazMat official scoops Mr. Hankey's corpse into a small white body bag.
Kyle
[Weeping.] Noo! No!
Stan
[Concerned.] Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
Wendy
[Arriving.] Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? [Damn.]
Stan
Okay!
Stan releases Kyle, who falls to the ground.
Kyle
Uuf.
Over at the Bijou, now showing: "BOW DOWN TO HOLLYWOOD, SOUTH PARK" A Film by TOM M. POONER. But inside, it's "A Bunch Of Gay Cowboys Eating Pudding", in color. Stan reaches for Wendy's hand. She notices, then looks at him. He pulls his hand back and looks at the screen.
Cowboy
Say, Tom. Do you have any pudding left?
Tom
I ate all mine up, silly.
Cowboy
Well then, now what do we do?
Stan tries again, and again pulls back. This time, Wendy takes his left hand in her right one and smiles at him. He smiles back at her. A few blinks from her eyes and a gentle squeeze from her hand and he vomits - at a man sitting in front of her.
Man
AAWWWW!
Wendy
Eeewww!
Man
[Facing Stan.] Hey!
Stan
Sorry.
Cowboy
Well, why don't we just explore our sexuality?
Tom
Ooh, good idea. Let's.
They hug, and the cowboy drops to work on Tom's pants.
Stan
Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!
Wendy is alarmed, Stan jumps up and.
Stan
Blaach!
He vomits on the man in front of him again.
Man
Aaww! [Turns around to face Stan.] Is there a problem, young man?
Stan
No problem, dude.
Hell's Pass Hospital. Chef and Kyle are at the ICU. The window above Mr. Hankey's bed is sealed so no sunlight gets in. The whole room is sealed in. Mr. Hankey has several wires streaming into him.
Kyle
I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
Chef
Come on, Kyle. It's time to go.
Kyle
Chef, does poo go to heaven?
Chef
[Chef ponders a moment.] Well, uh-I kinda hope not.
Kyle starts weeping.
Chef
I mean, sure it does.
Kyle quiets down.
Chef
Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.
Chef removes the face tubes and drops a ball into Mr. Hankey's mouth, then puts the tubes back.
Chef
Come on, let's go.
They start to walk away.
Mr. Hankey
[Weakly.] Kyle.
Kyle
[Rushes back.] Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho.
Kyle
He's back! He's back! [Chef returns.]
Mr. Hankey
That was delicious.
Chef
My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
Kyle
You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
Chef
You're daaamn right.
Hollywood Planet is finished and awaiting its unveiling. But first, over at Cartman's booth,
Cartman
Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!
Woman
I'll take two.
Man
I'd like to pay for one.
Cartman
Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
Robert Redford is at the podium.
Robert Redford
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood Planet South Park, that the festival will be back next year!
Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Jimbo are dismayed, along with the rest of the town.
Robert Redford
And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain!
The curtain drops to reveal Hollywood Planet in all its glory. Kliegl lights move their beams around and palm tress line the restaurant front.
Robert Redford
I give you, "Hollywood in South Park!"
He laughs sinisterly. The crowd gasps at the size of the thing.
Kyle
Wait!
The crowd turns to see who it is.
Kyle
I brought him! I brought him to show you!
Cartman is with Stan and Kyle.
Robert Redford
[Put off.] Oh, not this again!
Kyle
Behold! Mr. Hankey!
Mr. Hankey jumps out of the box.
Mr. Hankey
Hoooooowwwdy-ho!
The crowd looks at him blankly, then turns back to face the commissioner. Hollywood folks are hard to impress.
Robert Redford
Anyway, this new Hollywood Planet will be the official meeting place for all-
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival.
Short Man
Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't hear our chairman. If you could just turn yourself down. You're at about 7 right now, we need you at about, 3, okay?
Mr. Hankey's hands drop and he hops over to the podium. Robert steps aside.
Mr. Hankey
Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, "Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."
The crowd ponders the speech. Kyle smiles, and so does Mr. Hankey.
Robert Redford
[Grabs Mr. Hankey and pulls back.] I have had enough of you! [He tosses him away.]
Mr. Hankey
[Flying through the air.] Nyyaarrrr!
Kyle
No!
Mr. Hankey hits a wall and slides down.
Robert Redford
Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals.
Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Chef gather 'round Mr. Hankey.
Kyle
[Crying.] O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead.
Chef
Well, it worked once before.
Chef drops six balls into Mr. Hankey's mouth.
Mr. Hankey
[Recovering.] Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick!
He rubs his belly and hops off. As he does, syncopated music plays, and he switches to a sorcerer's cap. He's pissed.
Stan
What the hell is he doing?
Kyle
I don't know.
Mr. Hankey hops up to Hollywood Planet and jumps onto the top of the globe. He is now fully dressed as a sorcerer's apprentice. He starts to do his magic, waving his hands as clouds gather and poo jumps out of manholes and grills throughout the town.
Cartman
Whoa!
Robert Redford is awed. Mr. Hankey continues wielding his power, and three poo men rise up out of the poo that now covers the street. They start to dance.
An Agent
Oh my God!
Mr. Hankey continues. Poo pours forth from the Porta Potties nearby and builds into a giant wave.
Crowd Members
[Fleeing.] Aaaaahh!
The poo squelches them and sweeps them away. People clear out of the Hollywood Planet area. Robert Redford and Phyllis get out as well. Mr. Hankey is brewing something up and releases it.
Man
Oh, my God, it's crap!
Man 2
Ohh! Noo!
The poo traps a car and pushes it into the air as the poo turns into a twister.
Man 3
Whoa, it smells, it smells!
Robert Redford and Phyllis reach their car.
Phyllis
[Now inside.] Come on, let's go! It's coming!
Robert Redford
[With key in the ignition.] I'm trying, damn it!
Mr. Hankey directs the twister back and forth as it picks up stuff and people. He then has it engulf Hollywood Planet. The poo seeps into Robert Redford's car and fills it up.
Robert Redford
Aww. Aww. Glup.
The poo drowns them and pours out the car windows.
Man
Let's get out of this town!
Whatever people are left get into their cars and drive out quickly. Mr. Hankey lets up and relaxes, and the clouds clear away. The town is covered in poo. So are the townspeople.
Mr. Hankey
[Gazing at the scene.] Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength.
He takes his cap off and lifts it high in a flourish, smiling.
Kyle
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!
Townsfolk
Hooray!
Mayor McDaniels
Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!
Mr. Hankey
I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle.
He jumps down to Kyle.
Mr. Hankey
Kisses.
He kisses Kyle, and Kyle hugs him. Chef hugs both Stan and Kyle.
Wendy
[Stopping by.] Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films.
Stan
Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
Wendy
Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
Cartman
Yes. And I've learned something, too.
The others turn, Stan and Wendy hold hands.
Cartman
Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
End of Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls. The song of the same name plays.

Hell's Pass Hospital. Sharon and Dr. Doctor stand before Shelly's bed.
Dr. Doctor
It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.
Sharon
But what's wrong with her?
Dr. Doctor
It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?
Sharon
No, no, she's been perfectly healthy.
Dr. Doctor
Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease.
The door opens and Stan enters.
Sharon
[Sweetly.] Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan.
Shelly
[In disgust.] Oh, whoo-peee!
Dr. Doctor
You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes.
Stan
Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
Shelly
Shut up, brat!
Sharon
[With some urgency.] Will my daughter be okay?
Dr. Doctor
She'll be fine.
Shelly
[Stan scratches her cheek.] Stop it!
Dr. Doctor
We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.
A crash is heard, and Sharon and Dr. Doctor look on in surprise.
Stan
Ow!
Shelly has knocked Stan to the floor.
Sharon
Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go.
The Broflovski house. Sharon, Sheila, and Liane are seated at the dining room table. Ike is playing in his high chair.
Sharon
...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die.
Sheila
My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness.
Liane
I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
Sharon
So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young.
Sheila
That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time.
Liane
Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it.
Sharon
So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
Sheila
Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now.
Kyle, Stan, and Cartman walk up to the table.
Kyle
Are you guys having a meeting or something?
Sheila
How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
Cartman
No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
Kyle
Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
Sharon
Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final.
Cartman
Oh weak!
The boys have gone home to gather their things. Now they meet up and walk to Kenny's house.
Kyle
I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
Stan
Yeah, it's pretty weird.
The boys cross some railroad tracks.
Kyle
Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.
They come upon a house with an orange cat and a small gray dog milling around. Strewn about the yard are a motor, a sofa, a refrigerator, a pack of beer bottles...
Kyle
Well, here's Kenny's house.
Cartman
In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto

Stan knocks on the door and Stuart McCormick answers, beer in hand.
Stuart
Yeah?
Stan
We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
Stuart
What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?
Mrs. McCormick
[Intruding.] That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young.
Stuart
Oh yeah.
Stan
Catch what?
Mrs. McCormick
Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner.
The boys follow the parents in. Shag carpeting, another sofa, an engine block doubling as a coffee table, a beer sign...
Cartman
And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto

Stuart sits in his armchair.
Stan
Sshh! Cartman!
Cartman
What?
Mrs. McCormick
[Setting the table.] Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!
Kenny
(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)
Mrs. McCormick
I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
Kyle
Heheheh, buns.
Kenny
[Walks up to the other boys.] (Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)
Stan
Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
Cartman
[Scanning the room.] Where is the Nintendo?
Stuart
We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.
Rats scurry near the TV.
Kyle
Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
Mrs. McCormick
[Now finished setting table.] Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
Cartman
Oh, good. I'm starving.
The boys are seated, as are Kenny's parents. Kenny's older brother comes to table. All there is to eat is a plate of 5 or 6 frozen waffles and a toaster to toast them in. The boys can only wonder.
Mrs. McCormick
Let's say grace.
The boys put their hands together.
Stuart
Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen.
All
Amen.
Cartman
Pfff..!
Mrs. McCormick
Okay, let's dig in.
She drops a waffle into the toaster.
Kevin
That one's mine, that one's mine!
Cartman
[Coolly.] What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?
Everyone stops and waits.
Cartman
Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
Stuart
So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?
Kyle
I don't know.
Mrs. McCormick
Stuart, don't even get started!
She points at him.
Stuart
[To his wife.] What? I'm just askin' a question. [To Kyle.] You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!
Cartman
Puh! I heard that.
Mrs. McCormick
That ain't why, Stuart! [Sadness creeps into her voice.] It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night!
Stuart
Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!
Mrs. McCormick
What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!
Stuart
You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
Kevin
[Gleefully.] My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!
Mrs. McCormick
Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother.
Cartman
Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?
Stuart
Hey! We don't say "fuck" at the table, you little asshole!
Cartman
[Hushed.] Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either.
Kenny
(Aa-choo!)
Mrs. McCormick
Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them.
Stan
Huh?
Kenny
[Turning towards Cartman.] (Waa-choo!)
Cartman
[Recoiling.] Ey!
Cartman closes both his eyes, but then opens the right one. Later, in Kenny's room. Kenny has two posters of bikini-clad women and one of a 4X4 monster truck. His curtains are tatters and his dresser drawer is a battered suitcase. His bed has no frame to rest on.
Cartman
Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?
Kyle
Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
The boys go to their respective sleeping bags while Kenny goes to his bed. The boys roll down their bags and Stan and Kyle have Terrance and Phillip sleeping bags, Cartman however...
Kyle
Cartman, what the hell is that?
Cartman
It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
Kyle
No, it's not cool!
Stan
Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
Cartman
Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!
Kenny
(Uh-huh.)
Cartman
Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.
Stan
I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
Kenny
(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)
Stan
Oh.
The boys settle in, and Kenny claps twice. The lights go out.
Kenny
(Aa-choo!)
The next day. The boys have gone back home. First up: Stan's house. Stan has a thermometer in his mouth and his skin is starting to break out.
Sharon
Okay, lemme see.
She withdraws the thermometer, and reads it.
Sharon
Oh, goody! You've got a fever!
Stan
[Mad.] Goody? What do you mean, "goody"?!
Sharon
Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright.
Stan
Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night.
Sharon
Oh, gee, I guess you did.
Stan
Well, you sure seem happy about it!
Sharon
All right, it's off to bed with you, young man.
Cartman's house. Cartman is on the sofa scratching at his skin.
Liane
Don't scratch it, hon.
Cartman
[Whining.] But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!
Liane
No, hon.
Cartman
[Whining.] Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!
Liane
Here, I got you some calamine lotion.
She hands the bottle to him.
Cartman
I don't wanna.
Liane
It'll make your itches go away.
She opens the bottle and rubs some lotion on his face.
Cartman
Ugh. Uunnh.
She stops.
Cartman
Ey, give me that!
He takes the bottle and rubs some more lotion on his face.
Cartman
Ahhhh...
Liane
Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad.
Cartman
More calamine lotion!
Kyle's house. His parents look him over.
Sheila
I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.
Kyle
Yeah. I feel great!
Sheila
Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
Kyle
Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
Sheila
Did you sleep in the same room?
Kyle
Yes. Why?
Sheila
Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?
Kyle
No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
Sheila
Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
Kyle
Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him.
Sheila
I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.
Kyle
Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
Gerald
Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were.
Kyle
Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
Gerald
Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do.
Kyle
But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
Gerald
Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son.
Gerald sits and motions for Kyle to sit on his lap.
Gerald
You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods.
Kyle
Gods and clods?
Gerald
Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down.
Kyle
Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!
Gerald
That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America.
Stan's house, night time. Stan is in bed, motionless.
Sharon
[Enters.] Stanley, can I get you anything else?
She draws closer and feels his forehead.
Sharon
Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!
Next day, Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan now lies next to Shelly. Their parents are also present.
Sharon
Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay.
Dr. Doctor
[Entering.] Can I talk to you outside?
Sharon
Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?
Stan
Okay.
Shelly
[Now that they're alone.] Serves you right, you little brat!
Stan
Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Shelly
If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!
TV Voice
["Passion Cramps"] Will Carol find out she's a fa...
Stan
I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
Shelly
[Threatening] We're watching this!
Stan
Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. [Click.]
Phillip
Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?
Phillip raises his leg high.
Terrance
Sure thing, Phillip.
Terrance sticks his head in there, and Phillip farts on him.
Terrance
Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!
Stan laughs.
Phillip
That's tomfoolery.
Stan laughs, as do Terrance and Phillip.
Shelly
Give me the remote!
Stan
No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day--
She reaches over to his bed, presses a switch, and his bed folds in on him.
Stan
Ey! Get me out of here!
Shelly takes the remote and switches channels.
TV Voice
["Passion Cramps"] She was...
Meanwhile, outside the room.
Dr. Doctor
He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while.
Sharon
[Anxious.] Oh God, what have we done?
Dr. Doctor
There there now, it's not your fault.
Randy
Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.
Dr. Doctor
Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck.
Kenny's house. Kyle and his mom are visiting. She's talking with Mrs. McCormick in the dining room. Kenny and Kyle enter.
Kyle
Could we go home now, Ma?
Sheila
No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more.
Kyle
But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
Sheila
I've got a great game for you. It's called "ookie mouth".
Kyle
What's "ookie mouth"?
Sheila
First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time.
Kyle
Sick, dude!
Sheila
No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it.
Kenny and Kyle look at each other and walk away.
Sheila
That ought to take care of it.
Mrs. McCormick
You want some more hot water?
Sheila
Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?
Mrs. McCormick
Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity rich folk stuff.
Sheila
I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick.
Mrs. McCormick
Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!
Sheila
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Kyle
Ookie mouth! [Kenny spits in.] Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
Sheila
Try again, bubbe!
Kenny spits in Kyle's mouth again.
Kyle
Argh!
Sheila
You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers.
Mrs. McCormick
Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
Sheila
Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?
Mrs. McCormick
Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself.
Sheila
Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
Mrs. McCormick
Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd.
Sheila
But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
Mrs. McCormick
Uh-I don't know.
Sheila
We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
Kyle returns with Kenny.
Kyle
I can't say "ookie mouth" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible.
Kyle's face and hat are covered in spit.
Sheila
Practice makes perfect, bubbe.
Cartman's house. Cartman's on the sofa watching TV, scratching his face.
Cartman
Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!
Terrance
[With clipboard.] Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news.
Phillip
Give it to me straight, Terrance.
Terrance
The good news is, you have a clean bill of health.
Phillip
Oh, what a relief!
Terrance
The bad news is, you have cancer.
Cartman is shocked.
Phillip
Cancer?
Terrance
Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.
Phillip
My ass is collapsing?
Terrance
Yes. See this X-ray? [Turns it on.] That's your ass. See this line? [Points to it.] That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
Phillip
Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
Terrance
No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore.
They both laugh.
Cartman
[Somber.] Oh, no. [The itching returns.] Damnit!
Mr. Kitty strolls by.
Cartman
No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!
Kitty jumps up and Cartman uses him as a scrubber.
Cartman
Uh. Yes. Uh...
Liane
[Closing a door.] I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion.
Cartman
[Releases Mr. Kitty.] It's about friggin' time! Give me that!
He grabs the bag and hurries up the stairs.
Liane
Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while.
Cartman reaches the bathroom and closes the door. Then he opens the bag and pulls out six bottles of the lotion and pours them into the tub. Then he undresses and jumps into the tub.
Cartman
Uugh! Yeessss. [His voice trails off.] Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh...
He sinks into the water blissfully as bubbles pop around him. Meanwhile, Gerald and Stuart are driving to the river for a fishing trip.
Stuart
I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry.
Gerald
Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh...
Stuart
Tackle box?
Gerald
Yeah, tackle box. [Stretches.] Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?
Stuart
When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless.
Gerald
Right. Right-right.
Monday afternoon, South Park Elementary. The dismissal bell rings.
Mr. Garrison
And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?
Kyle raises his hand.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, Kyle?
Kyle
What the hell does that have to do with American history?
Mr. Garrison
Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?
Kyle
Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
Mr. Garrison
Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, "How I would make America better."
Kyle
What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
Mr. Garrison
Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too.
Hell's Pass Hospital.
Stan
Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
Sharon
Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick.
Stan
That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
Sharon
Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good.
Stan
Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
Randy
Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.
Sharon
Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper.
Stan
Wait! Where are you going?
Randy
We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
Stan
Milkshakes?!
Sharon
Yeah, and then we're going to the movies.
Randy
See ya, son. [They leave.]
Stan
Weak!
Kyle's house. Kyle is on the sofa working on his paper.
Kyle
"So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."
Kyle puts down the pen and paper and walks over to the kitchen.
Sheila
No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy.
Sheila is on the phone, Kyle is over by the microwave.
Sheila
He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
Kyle
[Softly.] What?
Sheila
I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it.
Kyle
[Frightened.] Oh my God!
Sheila
[Turns.] Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?
Kyle
[Angry.] You!
Sheila
[Subdued.] I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz.
She hangs up.
Kyle
You!
Sheila
[Walks over.] What, bubbeleh, what is it?
Kyle
You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
Sheila
Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young.
Kyle
Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
Sheila
Now, Kyle, come here.
Kyle
You get away from me, you crazy woman!
He runs off.
Sheila
Hoh boy.
Down by the riverside. Stuart and Gerald are fishing.
Stuart
Beer?
Gerald
Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries.
Stuart is expressionless.
Gerald
Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?
Stuart
Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
Gerald
Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
Stuart
[Soberly.] That's where I live now.
Gerald
Oh, right.
Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan is working on his paper.
Stan
And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
Kyle
[Rushing in.] Stan! Stan!
Stan
[Pointing to Shelly.] Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
Kyle
[Softly.] Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
Stan
What are you talking about?
Kyle
They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
Stan
They did?
Kyle
Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
Stan
Why?
Kyle
Because they're a bunch of assholes.
Stan
[Long gasp.] Of course!
Kyle
Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!
They rush out of the room, meanwhile, back at Cartman's house. Cartman is back in the tub, now working on his paper. Calamine lotion bottles line the tub and litter the floor outside.
Cartman
"I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."
The doorbell rings.
Cartman
Mom, answer that! "They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."
Kyle and Stan rush into the bathroom.
Kyle
Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
Cartman
I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
Stan
Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
Kyle
Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
Cartman
She what?!
Stan
It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
Cartman
That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
Kyle
No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
Down by the riverside...
Gerald
Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along.
Stuart
Not that easy. You were lucky.
Gerald
Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky.
Stuart
You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
Gerald
Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today! [Rising.] I wanted to be somebody!
Stuart
[Rising.] I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!
Gerald
You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!
Stuart punches him down.
Gerald
Ow!! [Gets up.]
Stuart
Now don't make me do that again!
Stuard hits him again.
Gerald
Ow! You son of a bitch!
Gerald chokes Stuart. They start tugging at each other.
Stuart
Uh!
Gerald
Ow!
Stuart
Oh!
Gerald
Ow!
Gerald ends up on the ground again.
Stuart
Eeaagghh!
Stuart jumps and does an elbow drop on Gerald.
Gerald
[In pain.] Huuuh!
Hell's Pass Hospital. Stan's parents are visiting.
Randy
Doctor?
Dr. Doctor
Yes?
Randy
Wh-where's Stan?
Dr. Doctor
Stan?
Randy
Stan, our son?
Dr. Doctor
Oh, yes. Where is Stan?
Sharon
You mean Stanley's missing?
Dr. Doctor
No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment.
Sharon
[To Randy.] Oh my God! Our son ran away!
Randy
Will he be okay out of the hospital?
Dr. Doctor
Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die.
Sharon
Die?
Dr. Doctor
Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs.
Randy
Okay, well well, let's go look--
Dr. Doctor
As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny.
Sharon
Oh God, no!
Randy
I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
Dr. Doctor
Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--
Kyle's house. Sheila looks after Ike, who plays with a toy truck. Gerald enters. His entire outfit is torn, he has a black eye and his fishing line is all mangled.
Sheila
So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
Gerald
That son of a bitch ripped my parka!
Sheila
Catch anything?
Gerald
I just don't get it.
He drops the pole.
Gerald
Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
Sheila
Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up.
Gerald
What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
Sheila
I thought it would be good for you.
Gerald
Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
Sheila
[Exasperated, she leaves.] I'm doing the best I can!
Gerald picks up Kyle's paper on the sofa and looks over it.
"My Final Solution by Kyle Broflovski."
"My dad is the smartest guy in the whole wide world. He has taught me that all poor people are actually things called clods. I wanna live in a world of only gods, so my idea to make America better is put all the poor people into camps."

Gerald
What?!
"If we get rid of them, there will be nothing but rich people. And there won't be any hunger, poverty, or homeless people. 'Cause they'll all be dead. The end."
Gerald
Oh, God, what have I done?
Chef's house. He's watching Terrance and Phillip. Terrance and Phillip are both on operating tables with only their heads and asses exposed.
Phillip
What's happening here, Terrance?
Terrance
We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
Phillip
Who's the donor?
Terrance
I am, Phillip. I am.
Phillip
Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?
Terrance
Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass.
Someone is knocking on Chef's door.
Chef
Oh, damn it, not now!
Chef goes to answer the door. Stan, Kyle and Cartman wait.
Chef
Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!
Kyle
Chef, we wanna know about herpes.
Chef
What makes you think I would know anything about that?
Kyle
Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
Stan
How does someone get herpes?
Chef
Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
Kyle
Do you know anybody with herpes?
Chef
Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her.
Stan
But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
Chef
Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to.
Kyle
Cool! Thanks, Chef!
Chef
O-kay!
He closes the door and goes back to his armchair. The boys leave.
Chef
Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
Main Street. Randy and Sharon drive around looking for Stan.
Sharon
Stanley?
Randy
Stan?
Sharon
[Softly.] Oh, Stanley, where are you..?
Randy
Stan?
Sharon
Stanley!
The car makes a right two blocks down, and the kids appear a block closer. They walk up the block and see an old redhead smoking a cigarette.
Kyle
Are you old Frida?
Frida
[Raspily.] Who wants to know?
Kyle
Someone who wants a favor.
Frida
Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b-- [Snorts.]
Kyle
[To Stan, throws his hands up.] Huh?
Cartman
We want you to give our parents herpes.
Frida
[Puffs out.] Five dollars.
Stan
My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. [Coughs.]
Kyle
Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital.
Stan
And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do.
The Monkee's "I'm a Believer" plays. The boys hire Frida, and take her to each of their houses. First stop, Stan's house. She goes into the bathroom and uses Randy's and Sharon's toothbrushes. Stan and Kyle smile, then Stan gives a thumbs up in approval. In the kitchen, Frida chugs away at a jar of milk, then sends the milk right back into the jar. Next stop, Kyle's house. She goes into the master bedroom and uses Sheila's lipsticks. Then she goes to the kitchen and soils the silverware by putting each and every utensil under her armpits. Stan and Kyle jump for joy and high-five each other. Last stop, Cartman's house. She goes into Liane's room and pulls out some panties, then rubs them all over her face. Cartman jumps for joy. They all return to Stan's house, and she licks away at some wine glasses and the phone receiver. Stan and Kyle high-five each other again. Finally, they pay her and she leaves.
Stan
Thanks a lot, Frida!
Frida
[Hacks.] Don't mention it.
She hacks again, pockets the money, and walks away.
Kyle
D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
Boys
Hooray!
Stan coughs and the adults burst into the room. Fear strikes the boys.
Randy
Stanley, where the hell have you been?
Sharon
Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!
Stan
[Hiding behind Kyle.] I don't wanna go back there.
Randy
[Coming for him.] Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital.
Randy drags him off.
Stan
Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
Randy
What?
Stan
You know, freshen up your breath.
Kyle
Aw, man. [Tottering, eyes half shut.] I don't feel so good.
Sheila
[Pleased.] Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--
Kyle
Ugh...
Kyle falls back, passing out.
Sheila
Kyle!!
Hell's Pass Hospital. All four boys are now in recovery.
Dr. Doctor
Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all.
Kyle
We're sorry.
Dr. Doctor
Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in.
Kyle
This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
Cartman
Hell no, you guys get your own!
The parents enter, they all have herpes sores on their faces, well except Liane for some reason...
Sharon
Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?
Stan
Pretty good.
Sharon
[Cheerfully.] The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
Randy
Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?
Stan
Wow, coo-hul!
Sheila
And how are you, Kyle?
Gerald
Are you doing okay?
Kyle
I'm better now.
He and Stan start laughing.
Sharon
What's so funny, you two?
Kyle
We gave you guys herpes.
Sheila
What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!
Stan
We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
Randy
I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
Sharon
[To Randy.] Well, I guess it serves us right. [To the boys.] Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox.
Sheila
It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it.
Liane walks over to Cartman.
Cartman
Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?
Liane
Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins.
Cartman
Hooray!
Gerald
And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me.
Stuart
Aww hell, I'm sorry, too.
Terrance and Phillip is on. The anal transplant surgery was a success.
Terrance
Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better.
He farts high and laughs.
Cartman
Well, I know one thing for sure.
Liane
What's that, Eric?
Cartman
We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
All the boys start laughing, then the parents join in. The doctor stands by Kenny and doesn't laugh. Kenny laughs, but drops dead. The meter flatlines and a long, steady note is heard. All stop laughing.
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Stan laughs, then Kyle, then everyone else, including Kenny's parents. End of Chickenpox. "I'm A Believer" plays.

Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods
A television is on, near the end of an episode of Barnaby Jones.
Police Commissioner
Well, detective. It looks like ya fooled them again.
Barnaby Jones
[Now quite old.] All in a day's work, I guess. I just hope that next time, I won't have to run so much.
The end credits roll and the TV is turned off.
The camera backs up to reveal that the TV is in Mr. Garrison's class.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, "This is not a victimless crime"? Anybody?
The kids just stare at him.
Mr. Garrison
Children, were you paying attention?!
Kyle
Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?
Stan
Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, and what do you consider normal?!
Stan
I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff.
The Class
Yeah!
Mr. Garrison
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!
The Class
Hooray!
Kyle
To where?
Mr. Garrison
To the planetarium.
The Class
AAWWWW!
Cartman
Planetariums suck!
Mr. Garrison
Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium?
Stan
It's boring.
Kyle
Yeah, all the constellations look alike.
Mr. Garrison
Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege.
The Class
[Softly.] Aawwww.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials.
A Cheesy Poofs commercial begins to play. A blonde wearing a Cheesy Poofs shirt is shown hiding something off camera.
Announcer
Hey kids, do you love Cheesy Poofs?
She pulls out the box.
The Class
Yes.
Announcer
Well, Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy Cheesy Poofs song. Watch for our talent van as it goes around the country.
Cartman
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
Announcer
If you win, you could be picked to be in our next Cheesy Poofs commercial. So remember,
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.

Cartman is singing along by the end of the first line.
The next day. Mr. Garrison and the class are headed away from South Park on Ms. Crabtree's bus. The kids are making a lot of noise and running around. Mr. Garrison stands at the front of the bus.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road.
Ms. Crabtree
THAT AIN'T HOW YOU DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!!
Mr. Garrison jumps back and the kids hurry to their seats.
Mr. Garrison
[Rubbing the back of his head.] Ow! Jesus, lady!
Tantalus V. Observatory. Ms. Crabtree hits the brakes so hard the bus bucks and sends kids flying out of their seats.
Ms. Crabtree
THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF!
Kid
[Voice quivering.] Ow.
The kids have all exited the bus.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves.
Announcer
[Over a loudspeaker nearby.] Does your child have what it takes to be the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer?
The Cheesy Poofs talent van is in the observatory parking lot. It is a shaped like a rocket on wheels. A sound system with towering speakers is set up next to it.
Cartman
Hey, there it is!
Announcer
We're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the Cheesy Poofs song better than anybody.
Cartman
I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back!
Kyle
You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
Mr. Garrison
Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
Cartman
But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
Mr. Garrison
No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on!
The rest of the class moves away.
Cartman
[Whining.] But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
The class enters the observatory, and some of the students are awed by it all.
A Boy
Wow, don't you...?
A Girl
What is that?
Dr. Adams
Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium.
Kyle
I thought it was "plane-*tarium*."
Dr. Adams
Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the "t" in "plane'arium".
Mr. Garrison
That's a pretty weird bone disease.
Dr. Adams
Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.
Cartman has his hand up.
Dr. Adams
Yes, little boy?
Cartman
How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside?
Dr. Adams
Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works.
Cartman
As if we care.
Kyle notices a young brunette with a clipboard walking in.
Kyle
Hey, who are you?
Dr. Adams
Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us.
Missy
I love my work.
Stan
Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
Missy
I love my work.
Her eyes are glazed over. Stan and Kyle notice this and look at each other.
Dr. Adams
Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?
In the planetarium proper. The class sits in a small theater and Dr. Adams is in a small room behind the class. Another kid works some controls on a machine on the theater floor.
Dr. Adams
Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable.
All the seats lean back on their own, so they have no choice.
Stan
This is stupid.
Dr. Adams
And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... eh-come out.
The dome darkens and some faint stars appear.
Kyle
[Not amused.] Whoopie.
Dr. Adams
Here we see the constellation called, "The Big Dipper". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it...[Very softly.] a-hah [The drawing appears, connecting the stars.] ...we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull...
The drawing of a bull appears.
Dr. Adams
...while these stars form the constellation, "Roger Ebert".
An outline of Roger Ebert's face appears with a thumbs down.
Dr. Adams
And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades.
From the two stars comes an elaborate drawing of crusaders storming the city of Jerusalem. Stan looks over at the kid on the floor and notices the same glazed-eye look Missy has.
Dr. Adams
Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of...
Cartman
Aw man, screw this.
Cartman gets up and leaves the room. Dr. Adams turns an "Intensity" dial to 9.
Dr. Adams
And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.
The kids are getting mesmerized by them.
Dr. Adams
I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that.
Meanwhile, outside, tryouts are underway. Cartman stands behind a boy currently singing for the talent van.
Boy
...you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame.

Announcer
That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner.
Cartman
Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
Announcer
Oh, and what's your name, little boy?
Cartman
Eric Cartman.
Announcer
Alright, here's Eric Cartman giving it a shot.
The cameraman starts filming, Cartman shoves Tommy aside, who falls down.
Tommy
Aaah!
Cartman
[Clears his throat and affects a tenor]
I love Cheesy Poofs
you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs
we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!

Announcer
[Slapping his palm to his head] Wow!
Cartman
Thaat's right, suck on that.
The planetarium doors open and the class exits.
Mr. Garrison
Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?
Kyle
Oh, man, I don't feel so good.
Stan
Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium.
Kyle
Me too. It was sweet.
Mr. Garrison
Really? What did you like best about it?
Stan
I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
Mr. Garrison
[Tallying.] Wait a minute. Where is Eric?
Cartman
[Happily popping by.] I did it! I did it!
Kyle
Did what?
Cartman
I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
Mr. Garrison
You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
Cartman
Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
Dr. Adams
[Now at the door.] Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor.
The class is on the bus going back to school.
Kyle
My head still feels funny.
Stan
Yeah, mine too.
Cartman
Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
Kyle
Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
Cartman
[With some pity.] It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.
A boy pops out from the seat behind Cartman in front of Stan and Kyle.
Boy
Waaaah!
Stan, Kyle
AAAAAH!
Kyle
Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
Boy
[Haltingly.] My... name... is... vvan... G-gelder.
Stan
Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!
Van Gelder
[In a state of panic.] Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno!
Cartman
Hey, be careful, asshole!
Van Gelder
Eegh! Don't take me back there!
He drops down, then comes back up.
Van Gelder
I can't... can't...
Stan
Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!
Van Gelder
Aaaagghh.
Van Gelder passes out and falls to the floor.
Mr. Garrison
[Quickly at his side.] We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!
The nurse's office. Van Gelder has been strapped down. Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, and Nurse Gollum are present.
Van Gelder
[Very agitated.] Aagh! The planetarium! Haah!
Nurse Gollum
I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.
Van Gelder
Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay!
Mr. Mackey
Okay uh van Gelder-
Van Gelder
Nnnaaaah!
Mr. Mackey
-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?
Van Gelder
Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh-
Van Gelder collapses.
Mr. Mackey
Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?
Principal Victoria
Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium.
Van Gelder
Haah! Planetarium!
Principal Victoria
I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
Van Gelder
Nnaaah!
Later that night, at the planetarium, Laser Loggins is underway. "Footloose" plays and Laser displays of feet dance around the ceiling.
Principal Victoria
Oh, man, this is boring!
Man
Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting?
The camera pans to two teen boys, who look like stoners, sitting in the next section by themselves.
Teen 1
Dude, this is totally killer.
Teen 2
I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man.
In the booth, Dr. Adams goes to his controls and turns the intensity dial to 8.5, "Footloose" fades, and the lasers close into a narrow beam.
Dr. Adams
You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.
He turns the dial to 9.
Dr. Adams
Incredible pain!
He turns the dial even further.
Dr. Adams
Incredible icky paaiin!
Teen 1
Dude, I'm totally tripping.
Teen 2
This is totally killer.
South Park Elementary, the next day. The school bell rings.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?
Stan
That's a haiku?
Mr. Garrison
No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school.
Stan
Oh.
Mr. Garrison
Was he on the school bus this morning?
Stan
No.
Kyle
[counting off the syllables]
Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.

Mr. Garrison
Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?
Kenny
(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)

The class roars with laughter.
Stan
Yeah. What's a discharge?
Kyle
Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
Stan
Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
Mr. Garrison
But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
Stan
[Stumped, then to Kyle.] Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
Kyle
I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
Mr. Garrison
Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
Cartman enters the classroom, a rolled up paper in his hand, full of himself.
Cartman
Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams.
Mr. Garrison
Eric, where have you been?
Cartman
Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
Stan
Where have you been, Cartman?
Cartman
Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship!
He unfurls the paper.
The Class
Whoa!
The paper reads, "Cheesy Poof Anthem Regional Champion"
Cartman
This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it? [Now taunting.] Hey, where is your regional championship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?
Clyde looks crestfallen.
Cartman
Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?
Wendy scrunches her face.
Cartman
Apparently, only I do.
Kyle
Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.

Cartman
Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion.
Stan
Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
Cartman
It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
Kyle
I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV.

Mr. Garrison
Very good, Kyle.
Cartman
Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it!

Over in Nurse Gollum's office, Van Gelder is still strapped down. Mr. Mackey stops by.
Mr. Mackey
Um. How's he doing, nurse?
Nurse Gollum
He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now.
Van Gelder
Nno! No drugs.
Mr. Mackey
Drugs are good, mkay?
Van Gelder
Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium!
Nurse Gollum
But why, van Gelder?
Van Gelder
The machine. The machine is aaaah.
He stiffens, then collapses.
Mr. Mackey
The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
Nurse Gollum
He's been talking about "the machine" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes.
Van Gelder
Wha- why in America's Funniest Home Videos? Why?
Mr. Mackey
Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?
Nurse Gollum
A what?
Mr. Mackey
Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
Nurse Gollum
Well, what will you need?
Mr. Mackey
Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time. [Oh, the tension!] Mkay?
Tantalus V. Obsevatory. The class is back.
Dr. Adams
Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more.
Mr. Garrison
They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
Dr. Adams
Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?
The Class
Yes.
The two stoner teens appear, now dressed as employees and with their eyes glazed over.
Teen 1
This way, please.
Teen 2
Enjoy your visit.
Stan and Kyle look at each other. Moments later, the class is in the theater, looking at the laser show.
Dr. Adams
Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star.
Mr. Garrison gets up and walks by Dr. Adams in the control booth.
Mr. Garrison
I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
Dr. Adams
Certainly, Mr. Garrison.
Dr. Adams watches him leave, then quickly turns intensity dial up to 9. The stars brighten and dance rapidly.
Dr. Adams
You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-
He quickly turns down the intensity upon seeing Mr. Garrison enter the theater. He gestures at his next item.
Dr. Adams
...and right over here we see the constellation Orion.
Mr. Garrison gives him a thumbs up and Dr. Adams waves at him weakly.
Dr. Adams
Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar...
Stan
Dude, what just happened?
Kyle
What do you mean?
Stan
Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens.
Cheesy Poofs Call Backs Today! Cartman and his mom wait with the other finalists and their parents on sofas in the front office. Cartman is picking at his nose.
Liane
Don't pick your nose, hon.
Cartman
I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!
Liane
Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
Cartman
I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
Poor Girl
Do you think I might win, Mommy?
Poor Mom
I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while.
Cartman thinks for a second then gets up on the sofa and points out the window.
Cartman
Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!
Poor Girl
[Gasps.] Did you hear that, Mommy?
Poor Mom
Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs!
They rush outside. Cartman follows them to the door and closes it behind them.
Cartman
Sike!
Back at the planetarium, Stan and Kyle are standing outside, the doors open and the rest of the class straggles out.
Mr. Garrison
[Noticing them.] What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
Stan
Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
Kyle
Sshh!
Dr. Adams appears at the door.
Dr. Adams
Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming.
Clyde
[Insistently.] I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!
Dr. Adams
Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here.
Clyde
Yes. Yes, please!
Butters Stotch
Me too!
Annie Knitts
Me too! I wanna do it! I'd love to work here.
A Girl
I'd like to tape the show!
Wendy
Yeah, me too! Me too!
Fosse
Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay!
The rest of the class chimes in.
Dr. Adams
Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it.
Dr. Adams
Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer.
The Class
Hooray!
All the kids but Stan, Kyle, and Kenny follow Dr. Adams.
Stan
Dude, this isn't right.
Kyle
Why?
Stan
We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
Kyle
Oh, yeah.
Stan
Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there.
Stan, Kyle, and Kenny go back inside and enter the control booth.
Kyle
Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
Stan
Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
Kenny leaves the booth and goes and sits in a seat.
Kenny
(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.)
Stan
He hits this switch-
Stan moves the intensity dial to 1 and the power comes on. The lights go down.
Kenny
(I don't see anything.)
Kyle
You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
Stan
Yeah, I guess so.
Stan moves the intensity to 4. The stars start to revolve.
Kenny
(Whoa, dude.)
Kyle
What does that do?
Stan
I don't know.
Stan moves intensity to 7.5, Kenny shakes audibly.
Kyle
Kenny! What's it doing?
Kenny can't answer. He just shakes more and more violently.
Stan
This says "maximum."
Stan moves Intensity to 10. Kenny shakes more violently, and finally explodes. Stan and Kyle look.
Stan
Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!
Kyle
We're bastards!
Stan turns off the power and races with Kyle to Kenny's remains.
Stan
Dude, I told you something was up with this place!
Rats start to work on the corpse.
Kyle
We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!
Back at the casting office, the finalists are showing their best.
Boy

He finishes with a flourish and a bow.
Center Judge
[Applauds.] Thank you... uh, Peter. We'll let you know very soon.
Peter leaves the room.
Center Judge
Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman.
Liane enters with Cartman and a boom box.
Liane
Hello, everybody. [To Cartman.] Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon.
Cartman
I know, I know!
Liane goes to a sofa and plays a tape while Cartman goes before the judges and clears his throat.
Cartman

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right.

He rips off his jacket and reveals a sky blue sequined vest and bowtie - and his belly button. The judges are surprised.
Cartman

She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right.

He moonwalks, then faces the judges again. End of performance.
Center Judge
[Long pause.] Well, Eric Cartman, that certainly was... insane.
Cartman
Thank you.
Center Judge
We'll let you know.
Liane
Thank you.
She and Cartman reach the door. Cartman is covering his nose.
Liane
Don't pick your nose, hon.
Cartman
I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!
They leave and close the door behind them.
Center Judge
Jesus, where do we find these people?!
South Park Elementary. In the nurse's office, Mr. Mackey is mind-melding with Van Gelder.
Mr. Mackey
Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
Nurse Gollum
This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
Mr. Mackey
Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded.
He goes back to concentrating.
Mr. Mackey
Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
Van Gelder
[Responding to the mind-meld.] Dr. Adams.
Mr. Mackey
Yes.
Nurse Gollum
He owns the planetarium. What about him?
Van Gelder & Mr. Mackey simultaneously
He uses the machine. The star machine.
Mr. Mackey
Mkay?
Van Gelder & Mr. Mackey simultaneously
He uses it to erase minds.
Nurse Gollum
But why?
Van Gelder & Mr. Mackey simultaneously
Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive.
Nurse Gollum
My God! This is amazing!
Mr. Mackey
Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?
Casting Office. The results are in.
Center Judge
Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman.
Cartman
[Triumphantly.] Yes! I'm the best!
Center Judge
You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium.
Blonde Judge
That's odd.
Cartman
[Joyfully.] Sweeet!
News 4 Special Report.
Tom
It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.
Asian Reporter
Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams.
Dr. Adams
Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium.
Asian Reporter
So, bring the whole family to the plane-*tarium* for a night of excitement and wonder.
South Park Police Department. Stan and Kyle are inside talking to Officer Barbrady.
Stan
...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
Officer Barbrady
That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys.
Kyle
But it's true, dude!
Officer Barbrady
Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
Stan
Yeah, pretty sure.
!Officer Barbrady
Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong.
Stan
What other crime in South Park?
Officer Barbrady
Oh, yeah. Let's go.
Time for Cartman's big debut.
Director
Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
Cartman
I'm over here.
Cartman is dressed as a Cheesy Poof.
Liane
Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy.
Cartman
Aay!
A stagehand escorts Cartman to the Cheesy Poof backdrop before the camera.
Cartman
Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
Director
Okay, roll camera, aaand action.
Cartman
I love Cheesy Poofs, you-

Liane
Oh wait, wait.
She runs in with a handkerchief.
Liane
You've got a little eye booger, hon.
Cartman
Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!
She wipes it off.
Liane
Got it.
She moves off the stage.
Director
Aaand action.
Cartman
I love Cheesy Poofs-

Director
Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?
Stagehand
Sure thing.
He adjusts the lighting.
Cartman
Oh, man, c'mon!
Stagehand
Got it.
Director
Okay. Here we go, aaand action.
Cartman
I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-

Director
Cut!
Cartman
What?!
Director
I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
Cartman
Oh, God damnit!
Officer Barbrady, Stan, and Kyle show up at the planetarium. Officer Barbrady knocks and the door opens.
Dr. Adams
Oh. Hello, officer of the law.
Officer Barbrady
Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator.
Dr. Adams
What brings you out here?
Officer Barbrady
Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town.
Officer Barbrady starts laughing.
Dr. Adams
Oh, really?
Dr. Adams leans forward menacingly. The boys huddle close to Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of.
Officer Barbrady advances, but Dr. Adams blocks the door.
Dr. Adams
Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time.
Officer Barbrady
Okay, I'll be quick, then.
Dr. Adams
Of course, officer. Come on in.
Officer Barbrady and the boys enter. What they see inside is something else. Kids, Bebe among them, are sweeping and cleaning the exhibits. Chef is helping out, too. All of them are wearing gray planetarium suits.
Chef
[In a low monotone.] Hello, children.
Stan
Oh, no! They got Chef, too!
Chef
Welcome to the planetarium.
Officer Barbrady
Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef.
Chef
[Slowly, mechanically.] I love my work.
Officer Barbrady
Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too.
Dr. Adams
Would you like to see the stars, officer?
Stan, Kyle
No!
Officer Barbrady
That would be super-duper!
He walks into the theater with Dr. Adams.
Kyle
Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!
Cartman's house. He's calling everyone he knows...
Elderly Woman
[On the phone.] Hello?
Cartman
Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.
Grandma
Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you.
Cartman
I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
Grandma
Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for-
Cartman
Okay, bye.
He dials the next number.
The Marshes' Answering Machine
Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message.
Cartman
Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch.
He dials another number.
The Broflovskis' Answering Machine
Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message.
Cartman
Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
Back at the planetarium...
Dr. Adams
And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.
Officer Barbrady
Oh, neato!
Dr. Adams
[Turning intensity up to 8.5] And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley.
Officer Barbrady
Who?
Dr. Adams
To not be Elvis will cause you great pain.
Officer Barbrady
Pain.
Dr. Adams
You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me.
Kyle
He's not highly intelligent.
Stan
Why are you doing this, dude?
Dr. Adams
Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you!
Cartman's house. He's watching the TV for his commercial.
Voice-over
Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements.
Cartman
Oh, dude, here it comes!
Cheesy Poofs Commercial
Packed full of ingredients, Cheesy Poofs can really give you that quick pick-me-up. So remember, [A dancing Cheesy Poofs box appears.]
I love Cheesy Poofs,
you love Cheesy Poofs
[The box opens and Cheesy Poof pour out.]
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs,
we'd be-
[The Cheesy Poofs rain down on a pile of Cheesy Poof in which children swim.]

Cheesy Poof Cartman
Lame.
Voice-over
And now back to Terrance and Phillip.
Cartman
Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
Mr. Mackey and Nurse Gollum burst through the planetarium doors. Mr. Mackey is pissed. Facing them are Dr. Adams, Officer Barbrady, Stan, Kyle, and the two stoner teens.
Mr. Mackey
Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay!
Stan
Mr. Mackey!
Mr. Mackey
Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control.
Officer Barbrad
[Doing a twisted Elvis Presley.] Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?
Nurse Gollum
What's wrong with him?
Officer Barbrady
Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babe
uhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah.

Mr. Mackey
Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston.
Dr. Adams
No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis. [To Barbrady.] Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium.
Officer Barbrady
[Snapping into a sharp Elvis.] Holdjit
He pulls out his gun and shoves it into Mackey's nose.
Officer Barbrady
If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?
Mr. Mackey
Uh oh.
Officer Barbrady
[Voice skipping up the scales.] Odle-oh who whoo?
The planetarium, that night. Nurse Gollum, Mr. Mackey, Stan, and Kyle are strapped into their seats in the theater.
Dr Adams
Well, let's begin, shall we?
He starts up the laser show controls.
Dr. Adams
And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known!
Cartman enters, oblivious to the star machine.
Cartman
Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!
The other four are entranced now.
Cartman
Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!
He sees that the others aren't responding.
Cartman
You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!
He walks up to the star machine and kicks it. It falls down and breaks into pieces.
Cartman
Planetariums suck ass!
The star machine's beams come at Dr. Adams at full force and go right into his eyes.
Dr. Adams
Aaah. Aaah. Aaah.
Kyle
[Coming out of the trance.] Cartman! You saved us!
The others come out of it too.
Cartman
What the hell are you talking about?
Stan
Get over here and untie us!
Cartman rushes over and starts untying them, Mr. Mackey first.
Mr. Mackey
Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay?
Officer Barbrady
[Rushing in.] Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business.
Cartman stops.
Mr. Mackey
Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?
Officer Barbrady
[Snapping out of it.] Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor.
Stan notices the destruction of the star machine, and the fate of Dr. Adams.
Stan
Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
Everyone rushes to the control room window to see what's happened. Dr. Adams is seated inside against a wall, slumped on his right side.
Kyle
He got a full dose of the stars.
Stan
Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
Kyle
Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
Cartman
Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero.
Cartman scratches his nose.
Liane
[Looking in.] Don't pick your nose, hon.
Cartman
God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!
End of Roger Ebert Should Lay Off The Fatty Foods. The Cheesy Poofs anthem plays.
End of Roger Ebert Should Lay off the Fatty Foods

Clubhouses
A familiar intro plays, a playground scene. Bill plays catch with a blue-hatted boy in a red shirt, a brown-haired girl, Annie, and Token are on swings, and Pip and Red are on the hobby elephants. Stan is hiding behind a tree, using his gloved hand as a gun.
Stan
Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.
Cartman is patrolling the invisible boundary.
Stan
Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.
Stan waits for Cartman, who is wielding a stick, shaped vaguely like a pistol, to pass, then rushes past him.
Stan
American base is only a few feet away.
Cartman turns and notices Stan.
Cartman
What is this? Halt!
They "fire" away at each other. From behind a nearby bush Kyle and Kenny pop up and "fire" at Cartman.
Cartman
It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
Stan
Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!
Kyle
Yeah! You're dead!
Cartman
I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--
Stan
No, you don't!
Cartman
--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets.
Kyle
Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
Stan
Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!
Stan and Kyle leave.
Cartman
That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!
Kenny laughs and Cartman looks at him.
Cartman
What?
Stan and Kyle have walked off away from Cartman and Kenny.
Kyle
Well? Now what are we going to do?
Stan
Huh-I dunno.
Wendy walks up, with Bebe closely following behind her.
Wendy
Hi, Stan.
Stan
Hi, Wendy.
Wendy
Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today?
Bebe comes out from behind Wendy, looking hopeful.
Kyle
I dunno.
Wendy
She does. She looks very pretty.
Kyle
Okay.
Wendy
Stan, can I talk to you for a second?
Wendy takes his hand and pulls him aside. Bebe and Kyle are left to look at each other. Bebe smiles at Kyle, and he looks around and put his hands behind him. The two remain silent. She's still smiling. Wendy and Stan walk out of earshot from them.
Wendy
Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?
Stan
...No.
Wendy
If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace.
Stan
We could?
Wendy
Yeah, Stan.
Stan
But dude, I don't have a clubhouse.
Wendy
You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
Stan
Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
Back near the tree, Cartman is sitting on Kenny who is struggling to escape.
Cartman
Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk!
Kenny is too weak to escape and Cartman farts on him.
Kenny
(Heellp!!)
Wendy
Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!
Stan
[Intrigued.] Truth or Dare? Wow.
Stan walks back over to Kyle.
Stan
Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
Kyle
We do?
Stan
We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.
They walk off. Bebe's eyes follow them out, and Wendy rejoins her.
Bebe
[To Wendy.] Did it work?
Wendy
I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend.
Bebe
I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
The Marsh house. Randy turns on the TV and ends up on Terrance and Phillip, who are in a church.
Terrance
Hey, Phillip, pull my finger.
Phillip
All right, Terrance.
Phillip pulls Terrance's finger.
Terrance
Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder.
Phillip
Well, all right.
Phillip tugs harder.
Terrance
Hurgh, urgh.
Randy laughs.
Terrance
Damn it! Pull really hard, Phillip!
Phillip
Okay.
Terrance
Hurgh-rrh. Waiwait, wait wait. Hrhrhrhrh. Aha! Hr-rhrh. Oh my! Yeee-aaa!
Terrance takes a deep breath to try to push out a fart.
Terrance
Hurh. Uhwaiwait. Ye-aauraah-
A weak, high pitched fart finally escapes, and the two laugh.
Terrance
Caught you there!
Randy
Uh oh!
Randy laughs, as Stan and Kyle approach.
Phillip
God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!
Terrance
Yes, I sure did!
Randy laughs some more.
Kyle
Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
Randy
No, I was just uh flipping through the channels.
He starts changing the channels.
Stan
Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.
Randy
Okay.
Stan
How do we do it?
Randy
Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
Stan
Yeah, dude! How'd you know?
Stan and Kyle are stunned.
Randy
How do you think I met your mother?
Sharon
[Walks in.] Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!
Randy
Oh, brother.
Terrance and Phillip are heard laughing, and Sharon looks at the TV. Phillip, right leg high, farts on Terrance, and they both continue laughing.
Sharon
Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!
Randy
Yeah, Stanley, you should know better.
Stan
Dude!
Sharon takes the remote from Randy and presses a few buttons.
Sharon
Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot.
Sharon
Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?
Randy
[Resisting.] Okay, okay.
Randy follows her off into the kitchen as the boys watch Fat Abbot.
Fat Abbot
Hey hey hey. What's goin' on, Rudy?
Rudy
Man, Fat Abbot, you need to lose weight!
Fat Abbot
I'll lose weight when I feel like it, bitch! Shut yo bitchass mouth, ho!
Rudy
Bitch, I'll kick yo ass!
Kyle
Whoa, dude!
Stan
Sweet!
Fat Abbot
You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo nigga ass, shithole!
Kyle
Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!
Over in the kitchen, Randy is under the sink.
Sharon
Did you find it?
Randy
Give me a second, would you?
Sharon
Don't snap at me!
Randy
I didn't snap at you.
Sharon
You snapped at me!
Randy
Whatever.
Sharon
What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, "whatever," to me!
Randy
I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry.
Sharon
I'm sorry, too.
Randy
Uh I think I found it.
He comes out from under the sink with an alarm clock.
Sharon
That's not it, you idiot!
Randy
Hey, back off, bitch!
Sharon
[Gasps.] You just said the C-word!
Randy
Did I?
Stan and Kyle are outside working on their clubhouse. The steps, supports, and floor are in place, and they start work on the railing.
Stan
This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
Kyle
Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
Stan
Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
Kyle
Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass.
Stan
Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
Kyle
What? Why?
Stan
Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
Kyle
Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!
Cartman and Kenny stop by.
Cartman
What are you guys doing?
Stan
We're building a clubhouse.
Cartman
[Laughs heartily.] A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!
Kyle
It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
Cartman
[Thinks it over.] Wwwhy??
Kyle
Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
Stan
Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!
Cartman
That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
Kyle
Fine!
Cartman
Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!
Stan
Fine!
Cartman
Fine!
Kyle
Fine!
Kenny
(Fine!)
Kyle
Fine!
Cartman
Fine! That's fine.
Cartman turns and walks away with Kenny.
Stan
Fine!
Cartman
Fine!
Cartman's house. Cartman and Kenny are looking over the clubhouse kit Cartman has apparently ordered: The Ewok Village 2000 Deluxe Club House Kit w/Elevator. It has a two-story design. Cartman is wearing a yellow hard hat, and Kenny is trying to get a better look at the blueprints.
Cartman
No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!
Kenny
(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--)
Kenny inches the blueprints closer to himself.
Cartman
Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.
Kenny
[Still trying.] (Uh--)
Cartman
No, Kenny.
Liane
[Stopping by.] How's the treehouse coming along, hon?
Cartman
Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!
Liane
Sorry, hon.
Cartman
Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
Liane
Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.
Cartman
[Sliding into a whine.] But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!
Liane
Well, all right.
Cartman
Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.
Kenny
(You suck ass and you suck dick!)
Kenny walks off to get the carpeting.
Cartman
And stop your bitchin'!
Stan's House, Stan enters the kitchen and reaches for a jar as his mom washes dishes. She's upset.
Sharon
What are you doing, sweetheart?
Stan
Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
Sharon
You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie!
She walks off in a huff.
Stan
'Kay.
South Park Elementary. Class is now in session. Mr. Twig is still there.
Mr. Garrison
And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?
Mr. Twig
Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--
Kyle
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
Mr. Garrison
What did you say?!
Kyle
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
Mr. Garrison
I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!
Stan
But Mr. Twig sucks.
Class
Yeah.
Mr. Garrison
That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...
Cartman
So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?
Stan
Better than yours, fat boy.
Cartman
We'll see about that. [To Kenny.] Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.
Kenny
[Gruffly.] (Yes, sir..!)
Wendy
Is the clubhouse ready?
Stan
Almost.
Mr. Garrison
Stan? Are you paying attention?
Stan
Yes, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?
Stan
Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
Mr. Garrison
...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.
Mr. Garrison turns to write on the blackboard.
Mr. Garrison
Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh...
While he's explaining the mediocrity of The Love Boat: The Next Wave, the following takes place.
Kyle
Good guess, dude!
Stan
Phew.
Bebe writes a note and then hands it to Butters.
Bebe
Pssst! Pass this up.
Butters hands along the note to Kevin.
Butters
Pass this up.
Kevin hands along the note to Fosse.
Kevin
Pass this up.
Fosse hands along the note to Stan.
Fosse
P-huh pass this h-up.
Stan gets the note and reads it.
Mr. Garrison
Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!
Stan
No, I just--
Mr. Garrison
Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile.
Stan
I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
Mr. Garrison
Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!
Stan
But I didn't write the note!
Cartman
Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.
Stan
Shut up, Cartman!
Mr. Garrison
Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!
Stan
Oh, man.
Bebe is worried, as Stan goes up to the front of the class to read the note.
Stan
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass.
I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you.
 I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.

The entire class stares at Stan in shock.
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Mr. Mackey's office. Stan and Mr. Mackey are talking.
Mr. Mackey
Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, m'kay? Not for immature skylarkings.
Stan
What's 'skylarkings'?
Mr. Mackey
You know, like tomfooleries.
Stan
Who?
Someone knocks on Mr. Mackey's door.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, your parents are here.
Stan
Oh, no.
They enter and stand behind Stan.
Mr. Mackey
Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
Randy
Stanley, I... Skylarkings?
Mr. Mackey
Yeahm'kay?
Randy
Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
Sharon
Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
Stan
It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's.
Mr. Mackey
Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder.
Sharon
You really should know better, Stanley.
Randy
You need to shape up, mister.
Sharon
[To Randy.] Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
Randy
[A bit testily.] I don't interrupt you.
Sharon
There, you did it again! [To Mr. Mackey.] He interrupted me again.
Mr. Mackey
Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--
Randy
Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!
Mr. Mackey
Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad.
Sharon
[To Randy.] Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
Mr. Mackey
[Slowly.] Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.
Randy
When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
Mr. Mackey
Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.
Randy
Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
Mr. Mackey
Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--
Stan
Excuse me.
Mr. Mackey
-how do you feel?
Sharon
Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
Randy
Oh, please!
Stan
Hello?
Sharon
Oh, please yourself!
Mr. Mackey
Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?
Sharon
He is.
At this point everyone has completely forgotten about Stan, who gets off the chair.
Randy
No, she is.
Stan walks to the door and opens it.
Sharon
Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again!
Stan is gone.
Mr. Mackey
Mmkay.
Cartman's house. Foreman Cartman is back at the blueprint.
Cartman
Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.
A shot of their "clubhouse". It looks shoddy and horrible.
Cartman
Oh, man!
Kenny
(Uh huh)
Cartman
And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Cartman
All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.
Kenny
(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
Cartman
Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!
Kenny walks off and Cartman watches him leave. As soon as he's gone, Cartman throws off his hat and runs into the house.
Cartman
Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?
Stan's Backyard, Kyle is on the clubhouse floor, waiting as Stan climbs up the steps. A tire swing hangs from the foundation.
Kyle
Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
Stan
I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
Kyle
To me??
Stan
I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!
They start hammering a board onto the floor, but...
Kyle
We should use nails, dude.
Stan
My mom won't let us.
Wendy and Bebe arrive in backyard.
Wendy
Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?
Stan
Pretty good. We're almost done.
Wendy
Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!
Stan
We're going as fast as we can!
Bebe
Kyle, could you turn around for a second?
Kyle and Stan look at each other. Kyle turns around, then looks back with Stan at the girls.
Bebe
Thank you.
The girls walk away, and the boys resume hammering.
Stan
Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
Kyle
Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
Stan
No.
Kyle
Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
Stan
I didn't even think about that.
Later, at Chef's house. Candles line his dining room wall, and he and Stan are sitting at his table.
Chef
And then, they'll ask, "Truth or Dare?'
Stan
And I say, "Dare!"
Chef
No no! You say, "Truth."
Stan
"Truth?" But that's boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.
Chef
You have to say "Truth" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.
Stan
Oooh.
Chef
You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens.
Stan
Yeah.
Chef
Then, after a few "Truth"s, you finally answer, "Dare."
Stan
"Dare!"
Chef
But not like that, son. Like this: "Daaare".
Chef speaks in a low, senusal voice, as he moves his hand through the air in unison, for effect.
Stan
Oooh.
Chef
And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
Stan
You really think so?
Chef
Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
Stan
Wow!
Meanwhile, over at Cartman's house. Cartman is watching TV, munching Cheesy Poofs.
Fat Abbot
Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?
Rudy
Man, Fat Abbot. What are you doin' on this side of the 'hood?
Fat Abbot
You know somethin', Rudy? You're like school in summertime.
Rudy
School in summertime?
Fat Abbot
Yeah, bitch, school in summertime!
Fat Abbot grabs Rudy by the collar and lifts him up high.
Fat Abbot
Open yo' fuckin' ears and shit, ho, or I'll pop your bitch ass.
Donald
I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha.
Cartman
What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?
Cartman's doorbell rings, and he gets up to answer.
Cartman
Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?
Kenny
[Proudly, with thumbs up.] (Uh-huh)
Kenny has found two teenage girls.
Blonde
Hi. We ran away from home.
Brunette
Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days.
Cartman
[Amazed.] Holy crap!
He leads the three of them to the backyard.
Cartman
Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
Blonde
Oh well, I guess it beats living at home.
Cartman
[Enunciating properly.] Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? [Rubs his stomach.]
Meanwhile, over at Stan's house, Stan's phone starts ringing.
Stan
Hello?
Cartman
How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?
Stan
We're working on it.
Cartman
Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
Stan
No, you don't!
Female giggles are heard through the phone, and Stan pulls the receiver from his ear.
Stan
Dude!
Cartman
It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
Stan
Aw, that hunk of fat-- [Sharon walks in.] Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?
Sharon
Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out.
Stan
What?! Why?
Sharon
Because, we're divorced, Stanley.
Stan
Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
Sharon
Yeah, kind of.
Stan
...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
Sharon
But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy.
Roy
Hello, son.
Stan
What?!
Sharon
I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted.
Sharon leaves.
Roy
Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me.
Stan
This is happening way too fast.
Roy
Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!
Roy walks off. Stan stares after him blankly. Meanwhile, back at Cartman's house.
Blonde
So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, "Make sure you're home before midnight!"
Cartman
Ahaw, that's weak.
Blonde
And I go, "Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"
Cartman
That's killer.
Blonde
And she goes, "Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"
Cartman
That's totally weak!
Blonde
So I go, "Fine! I won't come home!"
Cartman
Sweet.
Blonde
And then she goes, "Fine! Don't come home!", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap.
Cartman
Killer weak, sweet!
Blonde
I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.
Cartman listens intently.
Blonde
I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
Cartman
I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"
The girls just look at him. Back at Stan's house, Stan and Kyle are putting the finishing touches on their clubhouse.
Stan
Okay. We're done.
Kyle
[Wiggling the railing.] Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy.
A piece of it comes off in his hand and falls to the ground, where it breaks.
Stan
It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls.
Stan climbs down.
Kyle
Okay.
Stan is humming as he is going away, but his is stopped by a pair of legs, he looks up.
Stan
G'oh?
Sharon
Stanley, it's time to go!
Stan
Go where?
Sharon
Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.
Stan
But no! I have to get the girls to come-
Sharon
Come on, Stanley!
She takes him away by the hand.
Stan
Weak!
A car is heard pulling up. It's Randy, in a red Corvette.
Stan
Dad?
Randy
Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.
Stan gets in, and they peel off.
Randy
Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
Stan
But I don't understand why we have to--
Randy pulls up and stops next to a pink Jeep.
Randy
Well, hello, ladies.
Blonde Female Passenger
Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight.
Randy
[Suavely.] I'm already there.
She winks at him and the ladies peel off. Randy turns to Stan.
Randy
What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.
Stan
Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?
Randy
Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.
Stan
But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?
Randy is stumped.
Stan
You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
Randy
Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.
Randy pulls back up at Stan's house.
Randy
Well, anyway, have a nice day.
Stan
What? That's it?
Randy
Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.
Stan gets out of the car.
Randy
You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
Stan
I guess, but--
Before Stan can finish, Randy drives off, Stan just watches, speechless. Moments later, he is inside his clubhouse with Kyle, they are looking out the window in anticipation of Wendy and Bebe coming over.
Stan
Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
Kyle
Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls.
Stan
No way, dude! Don't be silly.
Bebe
[Off screen.] Come on, Wendy.
Stan
We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?
Kyle
Right. Why?
Stan
Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
Kyle
Too eager to what?
Stan
To say "Dare," dumbass! Jeez.
Wendy
[Entering the clubhouse.] Hi, guys.
The boys are startled, but turn around.
Stan
Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?
Bebe
Don't you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"?
Stan
Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.
Bebe
Then come on!
They all sit, Wendy across from Stan, Bebe across from Kyle.
Stan
[To Kyle, softly.] Remember, "Truth" the first couple of times.
Kyle
Okay.
Bebe
Who wants to go first?
Wendy
I will. Kyle?
Kyle
Yeah?
Wendy
Truth or Dare?
Kyle
Umm. Dare?
Stan looks at him angrily, then punches him on the arm.
Stan
Dude!
Kyle
What?
Wendy
[Whispers.] How about we give him Bebe?
Bebe
[Whispers.] Okay.
Wendy
[Whispers.] Okay.
Bebe
[Whispers.] Okay.
Wendy
Kiss Bebe on the lips!
Kyle
What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
Wendy
What's the matter, Kyle?
Kyle
It's just wrong, that's all.
Stan
Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
Kyle
What the hell have you gotten me into?!
Stan
Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
Kyle thinks for a moment then looks at Bebe.
Kyle
Hoh boy.
Kyle puckers up, Bebe comes and gives him a peck on the lips.
Kyle
Sick!
He gets up and rushes to the entrance.
Kyle
Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!
Kyle shimmies on down.
Bebe
[Staring at him as he leaves.] Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!
Wendy
Your turn, Bebe.
Bebe
[Seated back by Wendy.] Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?
Stan takes a moment to look at Wendy, then at her lips.
Bebe
Stan, Truth or Dare?
Stan
[Sensually.] Dare.
Before Bebe can respond and bring Stan to Wendy's sweet lips, Roy pops in, ruining everything.
Roy
Son, could you please help me with the firewood?
Stan
...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
Roy
When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me.
Wendy
Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.
Stan
Crap!
Over at Cartman's clubhouse.
Blonde
I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen.
Brunette
[Pulls out a cigarette.] Our moms won't even let us smoke.
Blonde
Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it.
Cartman
Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
Just then, Liane calls up to him and he freezes.
Liane
Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.
He's clearly alarmed now.
Liane
Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?
Cartman
[Voice shaking.] Coming, Mom. [To the girls.] Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!
Guy in Leather Jacket
Hey, girls.
Guy with Long Hair
What's up.
Blonde
Oh hey, Scott.
Cartman
Who the hell are you?!
Brunette
Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind.
Cartman
How many people?
The bus stop, next day. Kyle is alone, and Bebe walks up.
Bebe
Kyle, can I talk to you?
Kyle
Okay.
Bebe
Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.
Kyle
Huh?
Bebe
I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
Kyle
Okay, that's fine.
Bebe covers Kyle's mouth with her mitten.
Bebe
No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.
Kyle
[Muffled.] But I don't care.
Bebe
Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.
She walks over to love interest.
Bebe
Okay, Clyde, we can go now.
Clyde
Bitchin'.
Clyde walks off after her. Back at Stan's house, Roy is watching a home decorating show. Stan comes in.
Host
These are café curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that!
A smattering of applause. Not many audience members.
Stan
Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
Roy
Nnuuhunuuhh.
Stan
What?
Roy
Chores. Do chores.
Stan
My dad lets me watch cartoons.
Roy
Well I'm not your dad. Okay? I'm not your dad! You- you can't just go around playing games with my emotions.
Roy starts weeping and walks away as Sharon approaches.
Sharon
[Arms on her hips.] Stanley, what did you do to Roy?
Stan
Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
Sharon
[Sighs.] Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?
Stan
If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!
Sharon
Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you're the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.
Stan
Oh.
Sharon
Bye now. Roy!
Sharon goes after him.
Stan
Divorce is stupid.
Stan clicks on the TV, and "Fat Abbot" comes on.
Fat Abbot
Heeyy heeyy heeyy! Hey Yolanda. Why is your eye all black and blue and shit?
Yolanda
Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye.
Fat Abbot
Stepdad? You gotta off his ass!
Yolanda
Really?
Fat Abbot
Yeah, bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap! Leave that motherfucker swingin' from a tree so high nobody finds him for days! Glock-glock, you know what I'm sayin'? Dumbassed motherfucker pullin' shit! Damn!
Yolanda
You're right, Fat Abbot. Thanks!
Fat Abbot
No problem, ho. Maybe later you can suck my dick, bitch-ho! Shit!
Bill
Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding.
Stan
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy.
Stan grabs paper and pencil and starts writing. That night, over at Cartman's clubhouse, the place is jumping, music is blaring, and a small crowd mills around. The long-haired teenager stands next to the radio for a moment, then passes out. Cartman brings a tray holding a box and bowl of Cheesy Poofs.
Older kid
Hey, kid, give me some of those!
Holding a beer bottle, he grabs some Cheesy Poofs and swallows them.
Cartman fights through the crowd to the teenage girls Kenny found.
Cartman
Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
Blonde
What? That game's for kids.
Cartman
This is bullcrap!
Cartman throws up the tray and lets it fly everywhere, Randy, who is also at Cartman's clubhouse party is hanging out near a girl dancing in overalls.
Randy
Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
Cartman
This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!
The music begins to build.
Punk
Mosh pit!
Kenny stands alone in an open space in the crowd.
Kenny
(Huh?)
The crowd rushes to fill it in and stomps all over him, then disperses, revealing rats feasting on his corpse. The lyrics appropriately say, "Why don't you just pull a piece of me? Why catch some piece of me? Why does everybody want a piece of me?"
Cartman
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Outside on the street in front of Cartman's house, Kyle happens to be passing by.
Kyle
You bastard!
Over at Stan's house. Sharon shouts for Stan to hear if he is home.
Sharon
Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?
She sees the note he has written, which reads: Meet me in the clubhouse. She tosses the note onto the sofa and walks out. Roy enters the living room after she has left.
Roy
Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of Harper's?
Roy sees the note and reads it aloud.
Roy
Meet me at the clubhouse.
Out inside Stan's clubhouse, Randy is sitting alone, Sharon climbs up and parts the curtain behind him.
Sharon
Oh, Randy. What are you doing here?
She climbs in and sits near him.
Randy
I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
Sharon
Oh I thought that note was for me.
Randy
Oh, maybe it was.
Sharon looks around, surveying Stan and Kyle's handiwork.
Sharon
Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.
Randy
I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
A moment of awkward silence, then Sharon gets up and goes to leave.
Sharon
Goodnight.
Randy
Sharon?
Sharon
Yes?
She turns back to face him.
Randy
Truth or Dare?
Sharon
It's too late for games.
She comes back in and sits down.
Randy
No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?
Sharon
Truth.
Randy
Do you still love me?
Sharon
Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him.
Roy exits the house looking for Sharon.
Roy
Sharon--
Roy springs a trap.
Roy
Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
Randy
Well, you never know. Maybe--
Roy
He-
Randy
--thing will work out.
Roy
Hello?
Sharon
Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
Roy
Sharon?
Randy
[Sensually.] Dare.
Sharon
Do me. Right here in the clubhouse.
Randy pounces on her and they go at it.
Roy
Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?
Stan is holding the rope to the trap.
Stan
Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
The next day back at the clubhouse, Stan, Wendy, Bebe, and Clyde are there.
Bebe
Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
Stan is nervous, sweating, but willing. He looks at Wendy then at her lips.
Stan
Dare.
Wendy and Bebe whisper.
Bebe
Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
Stan
...What?!
Wendy
Wow, that sucks!
Bebe
Do you think it'll hurt?
End of Clubhouses, Roy is still dangling from the tree outside.
Roy
Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?
End of Clubhouses

Cow Days
A game show. The audience is applauding a couple onstage. The host and his assistant stand near the contestants.
Host
Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?
Tom and Mary
We're ready, Bob!
Bob
Any particular prize you're hoping for?
Mary
Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too!
Tom
Oh, anywhere'd be great!
Bob
Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum?
A 9 second count-down begins.
Tom
Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this.
Tom grips his head with both hands as time runs out.
Mary
The upper vascular hood.
Bob
I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
Tom and Mary are overjoyed.
Bob
Fred tell 'em what they've won.
Fred the Announcer
Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado!
A woman dressed as a cowgirl shows off a picture of the town. The audience oohs and aahs.
Mary
Where?
Fred the Announcer
That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival.
A poster of Cow Days appears, then rotates to one of South Park. Scenes of the announcer's descriptions appear.
Fred the Announcer
Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!
The audience Awww's as a group of cows is shown.
Fred the Announcer
Congratulations, Tom and Mary.
Bob
Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited.
Tom
What was second prize again?
Bob
That's all for now. See you tomorrow on...
The audience joins him in saying.
Bob and Audience
Ooo, What The Hell Is That!
The theme music plays before they cut to commercial.
Mary
Ah shit!
South Park rodeo. A rider falls from his horse as it jumps some barrels, nearby on the carnival stage, Mayor McDaniels and her aides are standing.
Mayor McDaniels
Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!
Cheers go up. Mayor McDaniels and her aides wear Cow Days buttons. Others wear Cow Days shirts and wave little flags with cow designs on them.
Mayor McDaniels
As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow.
The crowd cheers wildly.
Mayor McDaniels
And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!
Jimbo walks up to the mic.
Jimbo
This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!
A giant curtain covers a large object.
Jimbo
Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!
The curtain comes down and a large statue of a cow is revealed. It's wooden, buddhaesque, in appearance, a dark gold color, with a large clock encased in its belly. The clock shows 1 p.m. The statue moos and the crowd cheers. Ned is at the front of the crowd, as are Tom and Mary.
Mary
This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
Tom
Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it.
Mary
Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive.
Mayor McDaniels
Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
The carnival gets underway. People mill around, the boys approach a booth that says "3 for $5".
Toss-a-Ball Operator
Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes.
Kyle
Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
A fanfare plays as a close-up of the dolls are shown.
Stan
Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
Kyle
Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
Operator
Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
Stan
Really?
Operator
Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves.
The operator shows the boys the tag, which reads
"TEЯENSE AND PHILLUP"

Cartman
Wwow!
Kyle
Dude, that kicks ass!
Cartman
[Breathlessly.] Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
Operator
Five dollars for three balls.
Cartman
Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
Operator
Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth.
A wooden board featuring a photo of Jennifer Love Hewitt's face is shown, a gaping hole where her mouth should be.
Cartman
That's easy!
Operator
Okay, we've got a player!
Cartman
Ay! Check it out!
He tosses a ball and misses, just to the right of the mouth.
Cartman
Damn it!
Operator
It's okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper.
Cartman
Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!
He chucks another ball at her, and misses.
Kyle
You suck, Cartman!
Cartman
I'd like to see you do better!
Kyle
Give me that!
Kyle takes the final ball from Cartman, and throws it. Direct hit, it goes into the mouth, but falls out and away.
Kyle
Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
Operator
It's gotta go through her mouth.
Kyle
But ih-
Operator
Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars.
Kyle
Here, give me some money, Cartman!
Cartman looks at him and starts laughing.
Kyle
Lend me money, fat boy!
Cartman
I only have three dollars left, asshole!
Kyle
Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.
The boys walk off.
Jimbo
[Still onstage.] Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows!
The crowd cheers. Kyle has found his parents.
Kyle
Mom, give me some money!
Sheila
Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!
Kyle
I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Sheila
Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets!
Kyle
I will if you give me money!
Sheila
Okay, here!
She hands him some bills, and he walks off.
Cartman
Sweet.
Back on stage, Jimbo gives more instructions to the crowd, which is still cheering.
Jimbo
Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows.
The crowd pays no heed and keeps cheering.
Jimbo
With that said, let's rock and roll!
The crowd strains at the starting line. Halfy is there, too.
Jimbo
Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!
The corral doors open, but not a cow moves. The crowd rushes forth.
Jimbo
They're loose!
Jimbo leaves the stage, the cows look bewildered at the townsfolk.
Cows
Mooooo?!
The townsfolk scream wildly, while the cows remain in the corral and moo some more. Ned runs directly into a telephone pole and falls.
Ned
Ow.
One cow timidly leaves the corral. A townsman looks back as he runs, and finds himself impaled on the lower half of a shattered phone pole.
Jimbo
[Running by.] Yeehaw!
A red heifer chews on some grass just outside the corral. A man comes and tries to provoke a grazing cow, but the cow ignores him. The man shakes his ass at the cow, then runs away screaming.
Back at the carnival, a ride named "Chamber of Farts" stands near a Ferris wheel. Its entrance consists of a huge lavender ass with doors through which the cars enter.
Kyle
Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
Cartman
I only need one, dude. I only need one.
Operator
Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts.
Stan
What's that?
Operator
Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
Cartman
How much is it?
Operator
Just three tickets, boys.
Chamber of Farts Ride
Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
Kyle
Is it like a- haunted house or something?
Operator
Sure. It's veery scary.
Cartman
Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
Kyle
No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Cartman
Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over.
Kyle
You'd better be right, dude.
Cartman
I'm right!
The boys step up to the ride and car 15 comes to them. They get in.
Operator
Keep your hands inside at all times.
Kyle
Okay.
They go in. They pass through a cemetery with asses everywhere. A man has his pants down just enough for his ass to poke through, a dog next to him has its tail up, there are flying asses about, and some volcanoes poke through the ground. All are farting. The car stops.
Chamber of Farts Ride
So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!
The car starts up again, and Cartman gets a dose of farts from an ass jet.
Cartman
Eh! God-damnit!
As they enter the Hall of Farts, a wailing fart is heard from two figures hanging from spider webs.
Stan
What the hell was that?
Chamber of Farts Ride
Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!
The car heads for a woman stretched out in torture. A weak fart escapes from her. The car leaves the Gas Caverns.
Operator
All right, boys. Ride's over.
Kyle
That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
Stan
Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
Cartman
[As they step down.] I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
Kyle
That was a waste of money, Cartman!
Operator
Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets.
Kyle
We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
Cartman
Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.
Cartman is down to $11.00, as he goes to get in line for the ride.
Cartman
Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
The Cow Memorial, 12:59 p.m. A cow comes to look at the statue, and the clock strikes 1 p.m. The statue moos. The cow looks around, then moos. Two more cows arrive. In the other area of the carnival, the boys are nearing the end of the line for the ride.
Kyle
This ride better be good!
Stan
Yeah, this line is way too long!
Cartman
I think we're almost to the end.
Kyle
We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
Stan
Here we go.
The boys pass under a banner that reads
"LINE RIDE"

Kyle
Finally!
Line Ride Operator
Did ya enjoy the ride?
Stan
What ride?
Kyle
Yeah.
Line Ride Operator
This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line.
Kyle
Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
Line Ride Operator
That's five tickets, thank you very much.
The boys leave with $6.00 remaining.
Line Ride Operator
Come see us again soon.
Stan
My ass we will!
Kyle
Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!
Stan
Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
Photo Seller
Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride?
They are shown the picture.
Cartman
How much?
Photo Seller
Just three dollars.
Cartman
Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet.
They are now left with $3.00.
Kyle
You dumbass, Cartman!
Cartman
What? This is cool.
Kyle
No, it's not cool!
Cartman
It is, too!
They head back over to the Toss-A-Ball.
Operator
Can I help you boys.
Stan
We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
Operator
O-kay, five dollars for three balls.
Kyle
How much do we have left, Cartman?
Cartman leafs through the bills, but doesn't answer.
Kyle
How much do we have left, Cartman?!
Cartman
Aah, three dollars.
Kyle
What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!
Cartman
Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
Kyle
You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
Kyle lunges at Cartman, and they fall to the ground, wrestling.
Cartman
Ey! Seriously!
A view of the carnival. After a while the boys calm down and stand up again.
Kyle
Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Cartman
Well, I'm sorry!
Kyle
Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
Cartman
[Thinks a moment.] Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
Kenny
[Pulls some out.] (What? These?)
Stan
Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
Operator
Sure, as long as they're good.
Kyle
Give him your food stamps, Kenny!
Kenny
(Nuh uh.)
Kyle
Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
Kenny
(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
Cartman
Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!
Kenny hands them to the operator, and Kyle receives the balls.
Kyle
Okay. Here we go.
Kyle chucks the first ball directly into Jennifer's mouth, but it bounces away.
Kyle
Hey! That was right on target.
Operator
Sorry, kid. Try again.
Kyle throws the next ball in, again directly on target, but it too bounces away.
Kyle
That does it! Shenanigans!
He points an accusing finger at the operator, then turns around.
Kyle
SHENANIGANS!
Operator
Uhwhat are you doing?
Kyle
I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
Operator
Shenanigans?
Officer Barbrady
What's all the hoo-ha?
Kyle
Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
Officer Barbrady
Why?
Kyle
This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
Officer Barbrady
If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just.
Barbrady raises his baton and points it at the operator.
Officer Barbrady
What do you have to say, carnival operator?
Operator
Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son.
The operator reaches inside the counter and switches balls to give Kyle a smaller one.
Operator
Here you go.
Kyle tosses it, and it soars through the mouth.
Operator
There, you see? We have a winner!
Kyle
It worked!
Officer Barbrady
Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!
Stan
Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
Officer Barbrady
Barbrady!
Stan
Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?
Officer Barbrady
You said Buttbaby.
The boys start laughing after a few seconds.
Cartman
Sweet.
Operator
Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick.
Kyle
No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
Operator
Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those.
Kyle
What?!
Operator
You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade 'em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Kyle
You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
Operator
[Ignoring them, speaking to the crowd] Step on up, just five dollars to play!
Kyle
Damnit, I have to have those dolls!
He walks off pissed. The others follow.
Stan
This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
Kyle
[Something stops him.] Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000.
The boys look at him.
Kyle
Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
Cartman
What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
Kyle
[Grabbing Cartman by the collar.] Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
Cartman
O-kay, I'll get on the bull.
Kyle
All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!
Kyle walks away. The others watch him.
Stan
[To Cartman.] He really wants those dolls.
Cartman
I guess, damn!
Tom and Mary have just exited the Chamber of Farts on car 11.
Mary
That ride wasn't very good.
Tom
Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time.
Mary
You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time.
The Cow Memorial. The clock now reads 1:59 p.m., and seven cows stand before the memorial. Two o'clock strikes, and the statue moos twice. The cows answer with two moos of their own. More cows arrive. Meanwhile, at a nearby bar.
Stan
Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
Cartman
Hey, this is sweet.
Kyle
You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
Cartman
I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
Stan
We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
Kenny presses the switch, and the mechanical bull starts to move.
Cartman
Ye-gah!
The bull throws him off, and he lands in a Zoomin' Pinball machine, face up.
Cartman
Ow!
Cartman shattered the glass, which scatters all around.
Cartman
Son of a bitch!
Stan
How long was that?
Kyle
That wasn't quite ten seconds.
Stan
Damn it!
They all walk over to Cartman.
Stan
That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
Cartman
[Whispering.] You guys, eh seriously, my back!
Kyle
Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice!
Cartman
[Whispering.] Seriously. Help.
None of the boys step forth to help him.
Cartman
Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
Kyle
What'd you say, Cartman??
Cartman
[Whispering.] I hate you guys!
Kyle
I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
Cartman
[Whispering.] Hate you guys.
The cows are now pushing the memorial across open fields. It now reads 3 p.m.
Elsewhere, the boys stand next to a rancher who has offered his bull for Cartman to practice on.
Rancher
Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got.
Kyle
Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
Rancher
Well, have fun, boys.
Kyle
Okay, Cartman. You ready?
Cartman
[Hesitantly.] Nnoo.
Kyle
Open the gate!
Kenny opens it. The bull stands there, then walks out slowly and turns left.
Cartman
All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride.
Kyle
[Whispers to Stan.] That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
Cartman
Yeah, this is sweet!
Stan
What are you going to do?
Kyle
Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball.
Stan
Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.
Kyle chucks a snowball at the bull's testicles and gets a direct hit. The bull starts bucking, pissed off.
Cartman
Eeyy!
Kyle
That's better.
Stan
Hold on, Cartman!
Cartman
Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!
The bull throws him off.
Cartman
Mother f-
Before he can finish, he is thrust into the snow in front of them.
Kyle
Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!
No response.
Stan
Come on, Cartman.
No response.
Kenny
(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)
Kyle
No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!
Kyle kicks Cartman.
Kyle
Get up!
Kyle waits a moment, then kicks him again.
Kyle
Get UP!
Cartman stirs, then stands up. He's pale.
Stan
You okay, dude?
Cartman says nothing, he sees everything undulate and hears Stan's voice echo.
Stan
Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
Kyle
Dude, I think we broke him.
Later, at Hell's Pass Hospital, in the waiting area.
Dr. Doctor
Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma.
Stan
What's the matter with him.
Dr. Doctor
Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.
Kyle
..Oh.
Stan
But can he still ride a bull?
Dr. Doctor
What?
Kyle
We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
Dr. Doctor
No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep.
Dr. Doctor turns and walks away.
Kyle
Damn it!
Now in Cartman's room.
Stan
Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?
Cartman
Bân xưa, Lee bân xưa!
(rough translation: Old friends, Lee old friends!)

Stan
What?!
Cartman
Boyongture taur lur mahrter.
Stan
Oh, he's fine, dude.
Kyle
You think?
Cartman
Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi.
Stan
Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
Back at the festivities, the Running of the Cows has ended, and Jimbo is onstage.
Jimbo
All right, damn it! We're not going to stand for this! Now, whoever stole our golden cow memorial, we're gonna find you and kill you!
The crowd stands silent.
Jimbo
Aall right, uhow about this? Whoever took the sacred cow, just please return 'im, and there'll be no questions asked.
Nothing. Jimbo now looks around.
Jimbo
Wait a minute. You folks from out of town. You're the only ones with a reason to take our beloved cow memorial!
People in the crowd start buzzing, as Officer Barbrady approaches Tom and Mary from behind.
Mary
Where are we going to put a 60-foot tall statue of a cow?
Officer Barbrady
Oh, I think maybe you'll answer that downtown, tourists.
Officer Barbrady cuffs them both and takes them away.
Mary
Oh my God!
At the carnival, the boys have returned with Cartman.
Stan
How's he doing?
Kyle
He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
Cartman
Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.
Stan
Do you think he can ride the bull?
Kyle
Yeah, I think so.
Stan
Cool.
The boys pass by a man in uniform, and his wife.
Cartman
Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!
Soldier
Huh?
Cartman
Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.
Soldier
Go away, kid. You're grossing me out.
Cartman
Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!
Soldier
Beat it, kid! Come on, honey.
They walk away, an announcement over the loudspeaker gets the attention of carnival-goers.
Chamber of Farts Operator
Come one, come all! The Chamber of Farts has been fixed and is reopen!
A crowd rushes to it, and Cartman is lost among the mass of people.
Stan
Jesus, dude!
Kyle
Hey, where's Cartman?
Stan
Oh, hell!
Kenny
(I don't know where he went!)
Stan
Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
Kenny
(Okay.)
South Park Police Dept. Tom and Mary are still in jail, shivering and seemingly forgotten.
Tom
Hoh, it's so cold here.
Mary
Where is that sheriff?! We need water!
Tom
Oh well, let's try to make the best of it, Mary.
Mary
You're right. We're not being positive. At least we get some time alone.
Tom
Yeah, and at least we've got our health.
A rat runs by.
Over at a ranch, two ranchers get out of a truck and walk into a field.
Grey Hat
I tell you, Mitchell, I ain't never seen nothin' like it.
Mitchell
Where are they again?
Grey Hat
Just right up over this ridge.
The ranchers reach the top of the ridge and look out over a large field full of cows gathered around the Cow Memorial, mooing. It is almost 9 a.m.
Grey Hat
That's what they've been doin' all morning, just sittin' there and mooin'. And more cows come all the time.
Mitchell
Well, I ain't never seen this before, neither. But I know one thing, when cows start gettin' together, it can't be good. They might start formin' a cult!
Grey Hat
[Ponders] Hmm. Cow cult.
Back at the carnival, rodeo riders test their skill. One of them loses when his horse throws him off.
Announcer
The grand-daddy of 'em all, the South Park Cow Days Rodeo! Let's begin the bull-riding event. Grand prize: $5000!
Stan
Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!
Kenny
(I don't know, can't find him.)
Kyle
He's up in, like, twenty minutes!
Kenny
(I know, I know!)
Cartman
[Off-camera.] Hello, prease! Hello!
Stan
[Points to him.] There he is!
Cartman emerges from the crowd, now wearing a hot-pink two piece outfit, orange blush, and an oriental wig.
Cartman
Sucky-sucky, five dorrah.
Back at the police station, Tom and Mary still sit and wait.
Back on the hill, Jimbo and Ned have joined the two ranchers.
Grey Hat
Here they are, just like we told you.
Jimbo has had enough of the Cows' shenanigans.
Jimbo
Okay, that's enough-a that! You cows need to dis-perse! All right, bad cows! Do you hear me? Bad cows!
The cows are unphased.
Jimbo
All right, Ned. You're gonna have to bust out the whip!
Ned lashes out his whip which makes a loud crack.
Ned
Mmmm-gahyah! Git along, little doggies!
He lashes out again and makes contact with a cow, this causes the herd to move in on him.
Ned
Bad cows stay! Stay!
The cows are pissed. They rush in and trample him into the ground.
Ned
AAAAAH!
Jimbo
Holy crow! Play dead, Ned!
Grey Hat
[Still on the ridge, casually.] I reckon we should get some help.
Mitchell
I reckon.
Back at the rodeo, the boys have Cartman on the bull, ready to ride.
Kyle
Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
Stan
Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
Cartman
Sucky-sucky five dollah.
Announcer
Up first, No. 24, Jack McMack!
The crowd cheers, and he removes his hat in appreciation.
Announcer
Three, two, one.
The the gate opens and Jack goes forth.
Jack
Yeehaw! Yehoo! Yeehaw!
The bull finally throws him off. The crowd is silent and watches him sail through the air.
Jack
Aaaaaaaa!
He lands, gored by another bull's horns, and dies.
Announcer
Oooh, that's gonna cost him a point deduction. Up next, number 14, Ming Li!
Cartman
Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!
Announcer
Here we go!
Stan
Dude, I'm having second thoughts about this.
Kyle
What do you mean?
Stan
I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
Announcer
Let her go!
The gate thrusts open, and "Ming Li" goes forth.
Cartman
Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!
Kyle
Hang on, Cartman!
Announcer
Wow, and this Vietnamese prostitute can really ride a bull!
Frank Hammond, his, partner, looks bored.
Announcer
I guess she's had a lot of practice, if you know what I mean.
Frank Hammond simply blinks.
Cartman
Aaah! Ten dorrah!
Still riding the bull, the crowd cheers on.
Cartman
Ten dollah, soldier boy!
Announcer
She's setting a new world record!
The crowd jumping up and down begin to chant.
Crowd
Ming Li! Ming Li! Ming Li!
The bull finally bucks Cartman off.
Cartman
Gaaah!
He ends up in the snow, where the bull comes and kicks him like a football.
Cartman
Heeee!
Stan
Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
Kyle
Go help him, Kenny!
Kenny starts to climb over the fencing into the ring but has second thoughts.
Kenny
(Huh-uh, I ain't gonna get inside that ring! Aaah!)
The bull runs through the fence and away, taking Kenny with him. Stan and Kyle watch Kenny disappear.
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
A rodeo clown picks Cartman up and carries him off.
Announcer
And this brave little whore from the East has really put on a show for us today!
His partner, rather disgusted, taps his mic until it falls.
Announcer
The winner of the bull-riding contest, Ming Li!
The rodeo clown places Cartman in a barrel.
Cartman
Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar.
Stan
We did it, dude, we did it!
Kyle smiles. Elsewhere, the cows are gathered again before the Memorial, about 3 p.m. Behind some large rocks, FBI agents pop up and take aim at the cows.
Agent
Freeze, cows!
The cows look up, startled.
Agent
The game is over! You will now return to your respective towns!
Jimbo stands next to the agent. The cows ignore them.
Jimbo
You hear that, cows? You're surrounded! There's no way out!
Agent
You will now all march in an orderly fashion into this trailer!
Ned opens the back door to the trailer.
Agent
Move!
The cows just look at them, then one of them walks forward and turns left, walking away.
Jimbo
Hey. Where's she going? That's the wrong way, you stupid cow!
The cow walks to the edge of a cliff and looks back at them.
Agent
Oh, dear Jesus, no!
The cow walks off the cliff, where it falls to its death.
Cow
Mooooo!
Jimbo
Nnoo!
The other cows reach the cliff and walk off, one by one.
Jimbo
They're killing themselves! Stop! Please! Can't we do anything?! Oh, God, the humanity, Ned! The humanity!
Jimbo weeps into his hands.
Agent
This is the first mass cow suicide I've seen in- at least eight months.
South Park Police Station, Tom and Mary still wait in jail. Back at the carnival, the boys walk over to the Toss-A-Ball.
Toss-A-Ball Operator
Oh, you boys are back again, huh?
Stan
Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
Kyle
How many ball does that get us?
Cartman
[Still Ming Li.] Odline daur shunba shunba?
Toss-A-Ball Operator
Aw I ah- I tell you what, boys. Uh, I'm gonna be really nice and just- trade you the 5000 for the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Kyle
You will?
Stan
Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden?
The operator starts tossing down the dolls.
Kyle
We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
Cartman
Ten dollah? Sucky-sucky?
Kyle
What are we gonna do with them?
Stan begins to answer but before he can, the head of the Terrance doll which he is holding simply falls off.
Stan
We should-
He looks down with Kyle at the head on the ground, horrified.
Kyle
..What the-?
Stan
Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs!
One of the Phillip doll's legs falls off.
Kyle
After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS!
Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison, and a small crowd show up.
Officer Barbrady
What's all this?
Kyle
Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
Mr. Garrison
You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!
Father Maxi
Yeah, and the food is terrible!
Chamber of Farts Operator
Hey, it's just a stupid rodeo! What do you expect?
Everyone starts arguing all at once, except Barbrady and the boys.
Officer Barbrady
Ho-kay okay, let's calm down. People of South Park, do you declare Shenanigans on the carnival people?
Townspeople
Yeah!
Officer Barbrady
Okay, carnival people, do you accept this decree of Shenanigans?
Line Ride Operator
..What the hell are you talking about?! This whole town is screwy!
Officer Barbrady
Well, that settles it! Everybody grab a broom, it's Shenanigans!
The town cheers, and some of the folks have brooms already. They gang up on the carnival people and beat them all for a long time. Stan and Kyle just watch.
One in the afternoon. Jimbo, Ned, and some townsfolk are pushing the Cow Memorial back into the carnival area.
Mayor McDaniels
You found it! You found the memorial!
Jimbo
Yeah.
Mayor McDaniels
And the cows? Are they all back, too?
Jimbo
They're dead, mayor. They're all dead. [Sobs.]
Mayor McDaniels
What?!
Jimbo
Oho, it was awful! [Weeps.] Cow after cow taking its own life, and we could do nothing to stop them! Oh, God!
Mayor McDaniels
Well, perhaps, one day, cows will learn that cults are never a good thing.
Jimbo
[Still sad.] I hope so, Mayor. I hope so. God I need a cold beer and a burger.
Jimbo hears the commotion from the nearby crowd and perks up.
Jimbo
What's all the ruckus over there?
He sees the townsfolk beating on the carnival people.
Mayor McDaniels
Sounds like somebody declared Shenanigans!
Jimbo
Oh, hell, I have to run home and get my broom!
Back at the police station.
Officer Barbrady
All right, you damned carnival people. Into jail with- [Voice wavering.] Oooooh?
Officer Barbrady notices the remains of Tom and Mary, who are no more. They've died of starvation and the rats have begun eating parts of them.
Jimbo
Hey, aren't those the people we at first thought took the wooden cow?
Officer Barbrady
[Nervously.] Yeah.
Mayor McDaniels
Didn't we ever release them?
Jimbo
Aw, I forgot all about 'em.
Officer Barbrady
Uh me, too.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh my God! Officer Barbrady, ugh, you never had Tom and Mary in this cell.
Officer Barbrady
I didn't?
Mayor McDaniels
No, no. In fact, they never came to South Park. We've never heard of them.
Officer Barbrady
Ooh, phew, I feel a lot better, then, although I could've swore that I had heard of them and they starved to death in my prison.
The bus stop. Stan and Kyle are swimming in Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Stan
[With a Terrance doll.] Say, Terrance, let's look for treasuh.
Kyle
[With a Phillip doll.] Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
Cartman
[Arrives, back to normal.] What are you guys doing?
Stan
Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
Cartman
Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
Kyle
Really? What about?
Cartman
Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.
He notices the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
Cartman
Hey, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
Stan
Oh-h. Nowhere.
Stan and Kyle start giggling.
Cartman
Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
Kyle
No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
A limousine pulls up and Leonardo DiCaprio is at the window.
Leonardo DiCaprio
Bye, Ming Li. Thanks again.
Stan and Kyle laugh even harder, as the limo drives off.
Cartman
Oh! Son of a bitch!
End of Cow Days

Chef Aid
South Park Elementary Cafeteria. While the boys wait in line for their lunches.
Cartman
[Singing.]
Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches
Stinky, stinky britches,
you got stinky--

Kyle
What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
Cartman
This new song by Alanis Morissette. I can’t get it out of my head.
Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches

Mr. Garrison
[Passes by.] Hello, children. Ready for lunch?
Cartman
Stinky britches,
you got stinky,
stinky--

Mr. Garrison
Eric, is there a problem?
Cartman
Yeah, I can’t get this stupid song out of my head.
Mr. Garrison
"Stinky Britches" by Alanis Morissette?
Cartman
Yeah.
Stinky,
stinky britches

Mr. Garrison
Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?
Mr. Twig
Hi, boys. How are you?
Kyle
When is Mr. Hat coming back?
Mr. Garrison
[Pause.] I told you never say his name in my presence.
Stan
But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
Kid
Yeah.
Cartman
[Quietly to himself.]
Stinky britches,
you got stinky--

Mr. Garrison
It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--
Kyle
He'd be better used as a coat rack.
Students begin laughing at a dismayed, offended Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
[Livid.] How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig.
Mr. Garrison walks off as the boys enter the kitchen.
Chef
Hello there, children.
Boys
Hey, Chef.
Cartman
You got stinky britches,
stinky--

Chef
What did you say?
Kyle
He singing some new hit song.
Chef
Eric, where did you hear that song?
Cartman
It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.
Chef
[Softly.] Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas.
Stan
What, dude?
Chef
Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago.
Cartman
You wrote it?
Chef
Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
Kyle
Wow, then you should get money for it!
Chef
Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all.
Kyle
Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
Chef
Well, all right. Maybe I will go. I’ll play them my version of the song.
Capitalist Records, California. Chef is playing his song for the record producer.
Chef (recording)
Stinky britches,
you got those stinky britches.

Chef
So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer, "Stinky Britches" was something I wrote several years ago.
Mr. Big Record Producer
Hmm… I really so no resemblance between that song and "Stinky Britches" by our artist, Alanis Morissette.
Chef
Huh?
Kyle
It’s the same goddamn song!
Chef
Now, look, I’m trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!
Mr. Big Record Producer
I am above the law!
His hair falls forward, and he quickly puts it back into place with Spooge hair gel.
Mr. Big Record Producer
Mr. Chef, I’m afraid you leave me no alternative. We’re going to sue you.
Chef
Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and you’re gonna sue me?
Mr. Big Record Producer
Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. We’ll have the best in the business.
Kyle
We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
Cartman
Yeah, and he’s Jewish.
Mr. Garrison's house, Garrison is watching Alanis Morissette's Stinky Britches music video.
Alanis Morissette
Stinky,
stinky britches,
stinky britches

A clattering noise is heard.
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Twig, is that you?
Mr. Garrison turns off the TV and goes to the kitchen.
Mr. Garrison
Mis-Mr. Twig?
He sees a pot of boiling water and approaches it, then lifts the lid. Mr. Twig is floating around, charred.
Mr. Garrison
Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!
He throws the pot to the floor.
Mr. Garrison
Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!
Courthouse, Gerald Broflovski is representing the defense, Chef.
Gerald
Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. We’re gonna bring these bastards down.
Chef
Right.
Judge Moses bangs his gavel.
Judge Moses
This court is now in session. Who's representing the defense?
Gerald
I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski.
Judge Moses
And representing the prosecution?
Prosecutor
I am, Your Honor.
The Prosecutor is none other that Johnnie Cochran, the spectators gasp at this turn of events.
Gerald
Uh-oh.
Chef
Why "uh-oh"?
Gerald
Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O.J. off.
Chef
Uh-oh.
Meanwhile at Hell's Pass Hospital, Mr. Garrison bursts through the doors of the ER holding Mr. Twig in a blanket.
Mr. Garrison
I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!
Dr. Doctor and his team turn to him, then rush over. The patient sits up and looks.
Dr. Doctor
Give the child to me.
Dr. Doctor takes the bundle and unfurls the blanket. The doctors draw close to look at Mr. Twig.
Mr. Garrison
[Panicked.] Is he going to be all right, doctor?
Dr. Doctor
Uhhh...
Mr. Garrison
Is he going to live?
Dr. Doctor
[Slowly.] It's a stick.
Mr. Garrison
...Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!
Over at Cartman's house, the boys are watching the trial on television.
Reporter
And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the...day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous "Chewbacca defense"?
Cartman
What's a "Chewbacca defense"?
Kyle
I don't know.
Stan
That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial.
Cartman
Goddamn, I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, "Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"
Kyle
I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
In the courtroom.
Gerald
...And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you.
One person claps. Gerald goes back to his table.
Gerald
[To Chef] We've got 'em.
Chef grins and gives him a thumbs-up. Judge Moses bangs his gavel.
Judge Moses
Mr. Johnnie Cochran, your closing arguments.
Johnnie Cochran
Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote "Stinky Britches" ten years ago, and they make a good case... hell, I almost felt pity myself. But, ladies and gentlemen, of this supposed jury, I have one, final thing I want you to consider.
Johnnie Cochran walks to a display stand and pulls down the screen.
Johnnie Cochran
Ladies and gentleman, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does not make sense.
Gerald
Dammit..!
Chef
What?
Gerald
He’s using the Chewbacca defense.
Johnnie Cochran
Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: "What does this have to do with this case?" Nothing.
Gerald buries his head in his hands, defeated.
Johnnie Cochran
Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense! Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests.
Judge Moses
[After a long pause.] O-kay, then.
Back at Cartman's house where the boys are watching.
Cartman
Wow, he’s good.
Reporter
In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense.
Courtroom sketches show an angry Chef staring at Gerald, Judge Moses holding his gavel, and Cochran in clown-like attire pointing left.
Reporter
Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide.
Back in the courtroom.
Judge Moses
How find you the jury?
Foreman
We find the defendant, Jerome "Chef" McElroy... guilty as charged.
The spectators gasp again.
Gerald
Whoops.
Chef
Whoops?!
Judge Moses
Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label. The full fee of two million dollars will be handed over within 24 hours.
Chef
Do I look like I have two million?
Judge Moses
Well, you have 24 hours to find it, or else you have to go to jail. For eight million years.
Chef is shocked. The bailiff whispers into the Judge's ear.
Bailiff
Uh, it's actually for four years.
Judge Moses
Oh, sorry. You'll got to jail for four years.
Chef
This can't be happening..!
Cartman's house. All four boys are shocked at the verdict.
Stan
Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
Chef's residence. Everything is being repossessed. Chef is leafing through a "Memories" photo album. Mr. Big Record Producer enters.
Mr. Big Record Producer
And that chair, too. I want that chair.
Chef
Hey, that's my favorite chair!
Mr. Big Record Producer
You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too.
Stan
Hello there, Chef.
Chef
Hey, children.
Kyle
What's going on?
Chef
Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with two million, I'm going to jail.
Stan
Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
Kyle
Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
Cartman
Ready.
Cartman removes his jacket and steps forward, in lederhosen. Oompa music plays.
Cartman
I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la
I hope my will enjoy my dance
Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
Would you like some sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--

Chef
Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better.
Stan
You do?
Chef
Sure. Just please stop.
Cartman
[Putting his coat back on.] See? I told you guys it would work.
Kyle
What's that, dude?
Chef
This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
Kyle
Did you ever know any famous people?
Chef
Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women.
One photograph shows Chef laying shirtless on a bed of hay in a lucrative position, with a goat standing next to him. The caption under it reads, "Germany".
Cartman
What's that?
Chef
Nothing.
Chef quickly turns the page.
Chef
Anyway--
Mr. Big Record Producer
Take this, too.
Mr. Big Record Producer takes Chef's photo album.
Chef
Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
Mr. Big Record Producer
I can take whatever I want.
Chef
But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!
Mr. Big Record Producer
I am above the law!
Mr. Big Record Producer's hair falls in his face again. He smears it back up with more Spooge.
Mr. Big Record Producer
I told you not to mess with me.
Chef
That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that two million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!
Mr. Big Record Producer
[Gasps.] You wouldn’t.
Chef
Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!
Mr. Garrison's house. Mr. Twig lies in bed, a portrait of Leonardo DiCaprio on the wall.
Mr. Garrison
I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better? [Sighs.] I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever. [Senses something wrong.] Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..?
Mr. Garrison pulls the covers back.
Mr. Garrison
Aaaggghhh!!
Mr. Twig is broken in half!
Mr. Garrison
Who did this?!
Mr. Garrison shouts outside through the bedroom window.
Mr. Garrison
You won't get away with this, you bastards!
Chef's house, Chef is on the phone.
Chef
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran. [Hangs up.] Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million.
Stan
Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
Chef
Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them.
Kyle
You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
Chef starts searching his closet for a coat.
Chef
I appreciate that, children, but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do.
Chef finds the coat he's looking for.
Chef
My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.
The boys Chef as he goes to the front door.
Chef
Wish me luck, children.
He leaves, closing the door.
Stan
We've gotta help him, dude.
Kyle
Yeah, b-but how?
Stan
Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
Live-action footage show an American Airlines plane taking off.
Somewhere in England. The boys, with Cartman carrying a box of candy, are approaching a mansion.
Kyle
Whoa, dude, this house is huge.
Stan
Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
Cartman
No, it isn't, you guys.
They ring the doorbell.
Butler
Can I help you?
Cartman
We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.
Cartman rifles through the box of candy.
Cartman
Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
Kyle
Are you Elton John?
Bulter
No, I’m one of his butlers.
Kyle
Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.
They go inside and find him in his closet, dressed in a 1970's concert outfit, with star shaped glasses.
Hi, are you Elton John?
Dialog
Elton John
Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know.
Kyle
We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
Cartman
We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies...
Elton John
I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan.
Cartman
What?!
Stan
Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
Elton John
Chef? You mean Chef-Chef?
Kyle
Yeah, dude.
Stan
Wow, you remember him?
Elton John
Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago.
Flashback, 1963, "The Small Bar".
Elton John
I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break.
Elton John
Oh, oh, you're my cheddar cheese girl
You're soft but firm,
and you go well with wine.
Oh oh, cheddar cheese girl
Cheddar, cheddar cheese girl

Man
Boo!
The audience starts throwing food and bottles at him, he goes backstage.
Chef
Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up.
Elton John
Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing.
Chef
Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics.
Elton John
I really thought I had it this time with "Cheddar Cheese Girl".
Chef
What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
Elton John
That's a great idea!
Chef
And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know, some slick glasses and shit.
Back in the present.
Elton John
And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music.
Stan
So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
Elton John
Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums.
Cartman
Three Crispy Yum Yums.
Stan
Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
Elton John
Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights, [Rushing.] including-but-not-limited-to-Asian-territories, with-a-twenty-percent-commission-from-all-domestic-sales, and-sole-ownership-of-any-and-all-publishing.
Stan
[Unsure.] 'Kay.
Elton John
Tell Chef I said hi.
Stan
Thanks, dude.
Kyle
Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
Kyle's house, Chef is in bed with Sheila who is having a post-coitus cigarette.
Sheila
Oy..! Thank you, Chef.
Chef
No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?
Sheila
Oh, of course!
She reaches into a drawer and hands him the money.
Sheila
Here you go.
Chef gets up to go.
Sheila
Leaving so soon?
Chef
I have a loooooong way to go to raise the kind of money I need.
Chef leaves.
Sheila
Well, best of luck to you, then.
Gerald walks in excited.
Gerald
How was it, honey?
Sheila
Pretty much what I expected.
The boys stand before another house, and Kyle knocks. The boys now pull a red cart with a large cardboard thermometer demonstrating how much they've raised. The door opens.
Stan
Hello, are you Meat Loaf?
Meat Loaf
Yeah. What the hell do you want?
Cartman
Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend.
Kyle
He’s not dying, Cartman!
Cartman
[Whispers.] Shut your goddamn mouth. [To Meat Loaf.] We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--
Meat Loaf
What's this for?
Stan
Our friend, Chef.
Meat Loaf
Chef's in trouble?
Kyle
Yeah. Do you know him?
Meat Loaf
Do I?
Flashback, The Pit. "Now Performing: Cous-Cous".
Cous-Cous
Nobody came again.
Chef
There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image.
Cous-Cous
What do you mean?
Chef
Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name.
Cous-Cous
Beefy? Like, uhh… Tri-tip!
Chef
That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf.
Back to present day.
Meat Loaf
I owe everything to Chef.
Stan
Wow! So you'll help him?
Meat Loaf
You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum Yums and a couple of Berry Bars.
Boys
Cool!
Crabtree residence. Chef is in bed with Ms. Crabtree.
Ms. Crabtree
All right, let's get this show on the road! Come here, baby!
Chef
Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use some... sex toys?
Ms. Crabtree
Sex toys? Like what?
Chef
Like this very special device.
Chef brings out a brown paper sack.
Chef
I call it "Chef’s pleasure bag".
Ms. Crabtree
How does it work?
Chef
Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.
Ms. Crabtree
Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot.
She drops a bit, and Chef places the bag on her head.
Chef
Ahh, yeah. That's much better.
Meanwhile, when the boys meet Rick James at his residence.
Rick James
Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers.
Kyle
Gosh, thanks, Rick James.
Stan
Yeah, thanks. [To Kyle as they walk away.] That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
[City Hall. Chef and Mayor McDaniels are in her bed.
Mayor McDaniels
Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show.
Chef
[Exhausted.] I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, come on, buck up, little fella.
Chef
I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.
Mayor
Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp.
Chef collapses to the floor.
Mayor McDaniels
Aw, hell!
Mr. Garrison's house, Officer Barbrady enters.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
What's this all about?
Mr. Garrison
These pictures just arrived. [Opens envelope.] I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed. [Pulls out the pictures.] Now, go arrest him!
Officer Barbrady looks at them, then at Garrison. Garrison looks at them, then softly.
Mr. Garrison
What?
Officer Barbrady
Can I go now?
Mr. Garrison
Yes—Yes, I’m sorry.
Officer Barbrady
[Leaves.] Weirdo.
Mr. Garrison
[Examining the pictures] It can't be. These can't be right.
Mr. Garrison walks to the guest closet and opens the door. He looks inside, and gasps loudly.
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Hat!
Chef's house. With three police cars already there, the boys arrive just in time. Inside, Chef is being cuffed by two police officers.
Stan
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
Chef
It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail.
Stan
No, you don't!
Chef
Huh?
Kyle
We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
Chef
Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
Kyle
Cartman?
Cartman is standing by the wagon with the cardboard thermometer of their earnings.
Cartman
Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated hyeeah.
Chef
[Dejected.] Oh.
Kyle
But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
Chef
I made about $410,300, but--
Mr. Big Record Producer
That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!
Stan
You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
Mr. Big Record Producer
I am above the law!
His hair falls into his face again, which he quickly fixes.
Officer
All right, you, it's time to go.
Chef
Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help.
Officer
Let's go.
The officer hits Chef with a baton.
Chef
Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
Officer
I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine.
The officers lead him out, continuing to hit him.
Chef
Ow! Ow!
Kyle
Dude... Chef is gone.
Stan
No more Chef.
Cartman
[Voice breaking.] No more Salisbury steak and... pecan pie. [He starts sobbing.]
Stan
We can't let him down, you guys.
Stan
Dude, it's over. He's gone.
Stan
No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
Cartman
Four.
Kyle
But what are we gonna do?
Stan
It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
Kyle
Chef Aid?
Stan
Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
Kyle
Hey, that's a great idea!
Cartman
Yeah!
Mr. Garrison's house. He paces back and forth in front of Mr. Hat. Mr. Garrison is in his underwear, Mr. Hat is seated in the armchair.
Mr. Garrison
Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left.
Mr. Garrison grabs him.
Mr. Garrison
I'm not going to take you back.
He takes Mr. Hat to his front door and throws him into the street.
Mr. Garrison
You can just go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
He walks out into the street.
Mr. Garrison
You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!
Mr. Garrison's neighbors begin to congregate.
Mr. Garrison
...I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!
Mr. Garrison notices the crowd watching him. Officer Barbrady walks up to him.
Mr. Garrison
What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
Dr. Doctor
It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough.
Mr. Garrison
What do you mean?
Barbrady
I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake.
Mr. Garrison
What? Jail?
The boys have set up a very small stage upon which a banner reads, "Chef Aid". Cartman is back to his song and dance.
Cartman
I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la

A couple approaches the stand, bewildered.
Cartman
I hope my will enjoy my dance,

The couple leave.
Cartman
Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay

Kyle
Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
Stan
[To Kyle.] Cartman just needs to put more into it. [To Cartman] Dance better, Cartman!
Cartman
[Faster.]
Would you like sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut,
Fräulein Setski.

A white limousine pulls up.
Elton John
Howdy ho, boys.
Stan
Elton John! What are you doing here?
Elton John
It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef.
Stan
Boy, do we!
Elton John
So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over.
More limos quickly arrive.
Kyle
Wow, cool!
Elton John
I see you've got a stage all set up for us.
Stan
Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
Elton John
Then, let’s rock and roll! Or something similar.
Cartman and Kenny
Hooray!
South Park Police Dept. Chef and Garrison now share the same cell.
Mr. Garrison
...And Mr. Twig is at home, he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history.
Chef
You finally snapped, huh, Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
What?
Chef
Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies.
Mr. Garrison
[Pause.] I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell.
Chef
What?!
Chef Aid. The stage is now larger, and has a PA system, drums, floodlights, and spotlights.
Teen MC
Okay, thanks for coming to Chef Aid, everybody! Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?!
Five people in the audience stand around, motionless.
Teen MC
Whoo!
No response.
Teen MC
All right, let's get things going with... Rancid! [Moves offstage and squeaks.] Ran-cid!
Rancid takes the stage.
Rancid
California sun has sunk

The five people in the audience immediately jump up and down very rapidly.
Rancid
Behind the Anaheim Hills,
here it comes tonight

Lots of people start purchasing tickets.
Rancid
I was hiiiiiigh on junk--

South Park Police Dept. A short while later.
Mr. Garrison
[Emotionless.] You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef?
Chef
No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!
Mr. Garrison
That's good.
Something pulls the cell wall apart, and the window falls, leaving a large opening.
Chef
What the?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, boy, we're free!
Mr. Garrison and Chef walk out to a truck.
Mr. Garrison
Wow, what a daring rescue.
He opens the driver's door.
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Hat! Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!
Chef is confused.
Mr. Garrison
Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat.
Chef
How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
Chef Aid. Rick James has just ended a song. The group is now a large, cheering crowd.
Rick James
[Vocalizing]
Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm

Teen MC
Rick James, ladies and gentlemen!
Rick James
God bless you, Chef!
Teen MC
And now here's your favorite band, Primus! Whoo!
Primus is on stage in large duck outfits.
Les Claypool
We're damned proud to be here to support our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who told us in the early days, to keep trying and to keep pursuing our dreams, no matter how much we sucked. I love that man.
Primus begins to play. Someone holds up a poster saying, "We Love Chef". Mr. Mackey is being crowd surfing atop the crowd.
Mr. Mackey
Whooaa..!
Mr. Big Record Producer walks up to the boys.
Mr. Big Record Producer
What are you bastards doing?
Kyle
We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
Cartman
Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
Mr. Big Record Producer
Oh, yeah? We’ll just see about this!
Teen MC
And now, here’s Joe Strummer! Whoo!
Joe Strummer
You know, when The Clash were on tour and we lost the beat, Chef would be like at the side of the stage going, "Don't forget, pump your loins, children." You know, that was like his motto or something.
Teen MC
Whoo!
Joe Strummer
Well, it's a rockin' world
Make no mistake about it

Mr. Garrison and Chef pull up.
Joe Strummer
It's a shocking world

Chef exits, surprised.
Joe Strummer
Could be what's so great about it
It's a rockin' world...

Chef
What the hell is this?
The music stops, and the crowd turns to face him.
Everyone
Welcome to Chef Aid, Chef!
Stan
Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
Chef
Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?
Kyle
Well, we helped.
Stan
We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.
Chef
I don’t believe it!
Mr. Big Record producer crawls under the stage with a saw.
Mr. Big Record Producer
We’ll just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts.
He starts sawing at one of the stage supports, laughing cruelly.
Teen MC
And now, here he is TV's Ozzy Osbourne!
Ozzy Osbourne
We're all here to help our good friend, Chef, who has touched our lives in the past.
Johnnie Cochran is now in the crowd listening.
Ozzy Osbourne
I remember when I was just starting out, Chef suggested I buy a pompadour hat. I thought he said, "Bite the head off a bat", so I did. And the rest, oh, it's just history. Now, let's go crazyyy!
Music starts and crowd roars.
Ozzy Osbourne
Ain't nowhere to run!

Mr. Big Record Producer is still sawing.
Ozzy Osbourne
Ain't nowhere to hide!

Ozzy picks up Kenny and bites into his head.
Ozzy Osbourne
Aarrggghhh!!!
Kenny
(All right dude, let me go now!)
Ozzy looks up with a bloody mouth, and Kenny's head is missing. The music dies down.
Stan
Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kenny’s head off!
Kyle
You bastard!
Teen MC
And now here’s Ween!
The crowd cheers. The band members, Dean and Gene are wearing "I'm in Ween" tees.
Dean Ween
We're thrilled to be part of Chef Aid.
Gene Ween
Chef was the guy who told us to do a country album.
Dean Ween
No, dude, that was Steve's idea.
Gene Ween
Oh. Then who's Chef?
Dean Ween
I don't know, dude. I thought you knew him.
Gene Ween
Oh, well. Anyways, here's our song!
Ween
Many colors in the homo rainbow
Don't be afraid to let your colors shine shiiiiiiiiiiine

Out in the crowd, Mr. Garrison has both Mr. Hat, and Mr. Twig.
Mr. Garrison
Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you.
Mr. Twig
[In a French accent.] Did you love him?
Mr. Garrison
It doesn't matter. He left me.
Mr. Twig
Did you love him?
Mr. Garrison
Yes.
Mr. Twig
Then run to him.
Mr. Garrison
But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision.
Mr. Twig
Love isn't a decision, it’s a feeling. If we could decide who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical.
Mr. Garrison
I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you.
Mr. Garrison tosses Mr. Twig away, and pulls out Mr. Hat, and smiles.
Teen MC
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Whoo!
The crowd cheers.
Elton John
Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy. I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend.
He starts playing as the crowd cheers.
Elton John
Wake up, Wendy!

Wendy smiles and looks over at Stan, who smiles back.
Elton John
Smell the coffee...

Kyle
Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
Cartman
Ha-ha, you're a wuss.
Stan punches Cartman. Mr. Big Record Producer is still sawing, finally getting through and the stage tilts slightly, with Elton John still playing. The lights short out and the audience is stunned.
Producer
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!
Narrator
And what happened then? Well, in South Park they say...
A little x-ray panel comes up and shows Cochran's heart.
Narrator
Johnnie Cochran's heart grew three sizes that day.
His heart grows in size and bursts through the panel, which then disappears.
Johnnie Cochran
Wait! [Walks to Chef.] Mr. Chef, this music has really touched me. I like to take up your case, free of charge!
Chef
You will?
Johnnie Cochran
I will.
Everyone cheers.
Producer
No!
Johnnie Cochran
We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer.
Producer
[Dropping to his knees.] Noooooooo!
Courthouse. Cochran now represents Chef, and the record producer has a new lawyer. The boys are now among the spectators.
Johnnie Cochran
Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client, Chef. I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, this...
He pulls down his display.
Johnnic Cochran
...is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one minute. That does not make sense. Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line? Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!
Johnnie Cochran now holds up a monkey.
Johnnie Cochran
Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey.
A juror chokes a bit, then his head explodes.
Outside. The courthouse entrance opens, and Chef emerges with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman behind him. Reporters gather around him.
Reporter
Chef, how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, "Stinky Britches"?
Chef
It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children.
Reporter
So, what are you gonna do now?
Chef
Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
Stan Kyle and Cartman
Hooray!
End of Chef Aid. Chef's version of "Stinky Britches" plays through closing credits.
End of Chef Aid

Spookyfish
Announcer
The following program is brought to you in spooky vision. Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand.
A scream is heard and the Halloween/Pinkeye opening sequence is shown.
Outer Space. A alien ship descends, and then turns towards Earth, headed for the western U.S. As it enters the atmosphere it begins to burn. It slows down and hovers over a road, then lands gently. A door opens like a camera lens, and an alien drops down. As soon as he moves, a tire crushes him. Judging by the size of the tire, the alien was 18 to 24 inches tall. The tire is that of the South Park Elementary school bus, which stops to let the boys off. Then it pulls away.
Stan
I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
Kyle
He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
Cartman
Hey guys. How's it going?
Cartman now has a full goatee. Kyle and Stan laugh.
Kyle
Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?
Stan
Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
Kyle
Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?
Kyle and Stan laugh again.
Cartman
You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.
Stan
What?
Cartman
I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed
Stan and Kyle stand there shocked.
Cartman
I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
Kyle
What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
Stan
Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
Cartman
[Excited.] Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?
Cartman and the boys look at each other.
Stan
Dude, this is creepy.
Stan's house. Stan walks in to find Sharon and someone new.
Sharon
Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo.
An elderly woman with glasses who has two gifts wrapped up next to her.
Aunt Flo
Hello, Stanley. Remember me?
Stanley
[Flatly.] Hi, Aunt Flo.
Stan hesitates to enter, Aunt Flo begins to tremble.
Sharon
Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice.
Aunt Flo
Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents.
Stan
Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!
He rushes in, Shelly turning up as well.
Aunt Flo
Okay, Shelly. This one's for you.
Shelly opens up the larger box and it expands out into.
Aunt Flo
It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theater.
Stan
Wow!
Sharon
What do you say, Shelly?
Shelly
Thank you, Aunt Flo.
Sharon
Okay, Stanley. Your turn.
Stan opens up his box and reaches in.
Aunt Flo
Your very own fish.
Shelly
What do you say, Stanley?
Stan
I don't know.
Stan and the fish look at each other. Stan shows some fear.
Aunt Flo
[Softly.] I think he likes you. [Normal.] Come on Shelly. Let's hook up your home theater.
Shelly
Okay.
Shelly follows her aunt out.
Sharon
How do you like your fish, Stanley?
Stan
I don't like it. It's spooky.
Sharon
Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room.
Stan
Do I have to?
Sharon
Yes, you do!
Stan
Damn it!
Stan walks off with the goldfish.
Sharon
Language!
A different Barbra picture zooms out from the center of the screen. Next: the bus stop. Kyle is already there.
Kyle
Where have you been, dude?
Stan
Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
Kyle
Aunt Flo?
Stan
Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
Kyle
Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
Stan
Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
Kyle
Here he comes.
Stan
Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?
Cartman
[clean-shaven] Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!
Kyle
You said you could get us money, Cartman!
Cartman
Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!
Kyle
Well, at least he's back to normal.
Stan
Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
Kyle
It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
Cartman
Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!
Stan
Why do you keep saying "hella", fatass?!
Cartman
'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.
Kyle
That's not cool!
Cartman
You guys are just hella jealous.
Night time, storm. Stan's house. Randy is about to turn off the light in Stan's room.
Randy
Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
Stan
Can you leave the light on, Dad?
Randy
Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
Stan
I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
Randy
Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. [turns the light off and closes the door].
'In the darkness, Stan pulls the covers close and looks at the fish. They stare at each other, and the fish blows a bubble. Stan turns away, then looks back. The fish just looks at him. Stan then turns towards the window and begins to fall asleep, until lightning startles him upright. He looks at the tank. The fish is gone!'
Stan
Where did it go? [he lifts the covers and looks under the bed, then sits back. The fish swims back into view.] Huhhh. [he gets out, picks up his shirt, and throws it over the tank. He goes back to bed and looks at the tank again.]
'[Kenny's house. Rain is dripping in all over the ceiling as pails collect the water. Kenny, Kevin and Mom share a blanket on the sofa while Stuart sits in the armchair.]'
Kenny
(Give me that-!) [pulls the blanket off Kevin]
Mrs. McCormick
Kenny [paf]
Kenny
(Ow, mom!)
Mrs. McCormick
You share that blanket with your brother! [knock knock knock]
Stuart
Who the hell could that be? [the front door opens and the family looks to see who it is].
Cartman
[with mustache and beard, and dressed in raingear] Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions. [a box of SUPPLIES is next to him. The parents look at each other] There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. [walks off].
Stuart
[suspicious] Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?
Kenny
(Uh huh.)
'Stan's house. He gets up once again to look at the tank, but the shirt is not on it anymore.'
Stan
Hey. Where did the shirt go? [hops off and approaches the fish] I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! [the fish blinks, then looks down and to the right. Stan's eyes follow, and he sees the shirt.] AAAaAaAaAa [runs back to his bed and pulls the covers up, then drops them a bit. He looks at the fish] I'm not gonna look. [shuts his eyes, then opens them again. The fish tank, and the dresser it's on, are closer to the bed] It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. [shuts his eyes again, then opens them. The tank and dresser are at the foot of his bed] GAAAH! [shuts his eyes tight, and opens them one more time. The fish tank is now on the bed, between his feet] AAAAAAAH!! [he jumps off, runs to his door, and rushes into the hallway] MOM! Mom! [comes back to the room with her in tow]
Sharon
Stanley, settle down!
Stan
Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!
Aunt Flo
[at the door] Is there a problem? [walks to Sharon]
Sharon
Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo.
Aunt Flo
Do you not like your goldfish?
Stan
No!
Aunt Flo
I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt. [buries her face in her hand and begins to sob.]
Sharon
There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. [he merely looks up at them]
'1:25 a.m. Stan is under the covers looking at the spooky fish. After a long while, the fish turns around and starts writing something on the tank wall with his tail. Stan gets out of bed for a closer look. The fish finishes writing and turns to blow on the wall. A gray area appears and the word "KILL" appears within it.'
Stan
AAAAAAAAH! [runs back to bed]
Sharon
[enters his room and turns on the lights] Stanley, what are you doing?!
Stan
[pointing] The fish! [nothing is left of the writing on the tank wall] But-
Sharon
Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up. [Shelly stands in front of Sharon, then approaches Stan and slaps him, then leaves the room] Go to sleep, Stanley! [turns off the light and closes the door behind her.]
'Stan gets back into bed and pulls the covers up. Another flash of lighting gets Stan to sit up again. He looks at the tank again, then gets out of bed for a closer look, failing to notice the growing pool of blood next to him. The fish again looks down and to the right, and Stan's eyes follow.'
Stan
[gasps. A man lies dead between the tank and the bed] WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
Sharon
All right, Stanley. I have had enough o- [freezes when she sees the body, then, quivering] Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? [rushes to comfort him]
Stan
Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-
Sharon
[covers his mouth with her arm, then quietly] Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel. [kisses him and gets up] Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body. [starts to drag it away] Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. [she drags the body out of the room and out into the storm. Stan just looks at her]
Stan
[turns to the fish] You're not gonna get away with this! [the fish writes again, blows, and the message is: "Yes I Will."]
'[Stan walks over to the window and sees his mom digging a grave next to the body. She then places the body in the grave and covers it up. She returns with the shovel to the kitchen and closes the door behind her.]'
Aunt Flo
[her silhouette appears] Sharon!
Sharon
D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!
Aunt Flo
Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve.
Stan
[sees Sharon pass by] Mom, what are you doing?
Sharon
Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley.
Stan
Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!
The fish blinks and blows a bubble.
Sharon
[enters the room] Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything.
Stan
But MOM!
Sharon
[Cradles Stan] Sshh.
Hush little baby, don't say a word.
Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' bird.
If that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard

'[8 a.m., next day. A rooster crows and Stan's clock farts. Stan wakes up and looks at the tank. The fish is still there. Stan hops off the bed and walks to the tank, but is stopped by another body.]'
Stan
MMOOMM!
Sharon
[frantic] What is it, honey? [gasp!] My baby's killed again!
Stan
[points at the body, then holds up his hands] No, mom!
Sharon
[holds him tight] What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do?? [the fish looks on. Sharon drags the body out] I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy.
Stan then stands at the window. As he looks out, a reflection of Sharon burying the body is seen on the window pane.
'[Almost 8 p.m., Kyle's house. Kyle and Cartman are at table when Kenny comes in]'
Kyle
It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
Kenny
(Uh huh!)
Cartman
Well, where is it? [Kenny brings out a squash and sets it on the table] What the hell is that?!
Kenny
(It's the only thing I could afford.)
Cartman
It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!
Kyle
Stop saying "hella," Cartman! [to Kenny] How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? [as Kyle says this Stan enters the room] Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
Stan
[squeezes into Kyle's chair so both fit. Cartman walks to Kenny's chair] I haven't been sleeping so well.
Cartman
[cuts the top off the squash and taps at the bottom to clear it out. Sigh] God, I hate you, Kenny. [works on the squash some more] I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! [goes into the kitchen for another one]
Kyle
God, will you shut up?!
Stan
Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
Kyle
Yeah.
Stan
Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
Kyle
I don't know. [the bearded Cartman comes in with a huge knife] Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
Cartman
[gives Kenny a hand] No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?

You guys are my best friends
Through thick and thin, we've always been together
We're four of a kind, havin' fun all day
Pallin' around and laughin' away
Just best friends, best friends are we.

I love you guys. [throughout the song, Kyle and Stan look on with awe]
Next day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are at the bus stop. A picture of Barbra in curls is now on all four corners.
Kyle
You seem tired, Stan.
Stan
I haven't been sleeping well.
Kyle
Why?
Stan
My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
Kyle
Hoh, that sucks, dude.
Cartman
Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
Kyle
Cartman?
Cartman
Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
Stan
What are you doing?!
Cartman
What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
Kyle
You can't be standing there, Cartman.
Cartman
Why the hell not?!
Kyle
Because you're standing over there!
Kenny looks at the bearded Cartman.
Cartman
[seeing his parallel for the first time] Aaah! Son of a bitch!
Evil Cartman
[Cartman walks to him] Wow, you don't see this every day.
Cartman
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Evil Cartman
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
Cartman
Dude, this is hella weird.
Sunrise, Stan's house. Officer Barbrady approaches the front door, humming. [He rings the bell]'
Sharon
[answering] Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woo, wh-what a surprise. What can I do for you?
Officer Barbrady
Well, there's been a report of a few missing people.
Sharon
Is that so?
Officer Barbrady
Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. [show her some pictures of the missing men]
Sharon
I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?
Sharon
[somewhat alarmed] Why would you wanna do that?
Officer Barbrady
Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I? [Sharon moves aside and Barbrady enters. They head for the back yard, where five fresh graves await around the clubhouse, and Sparky is pulling a leg out of one of them. Sparky pulls it free and walks away with it] Well, this all looks in- [clunk] oh? Tennis anyone? [falls to the floor unconscious. Sharon had hit him with a pan]
The fourth image of Barbra zooms out and back with a scream, and Sharon is now in the basement.
Sharon
Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
Officer Barbrady
[missing his pants and shoes, his wrists are tied to posts] Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.
South Park Elementary, lunch time. The boys are in the kitchen for their food.
Chef
[excited] Hello there, children! [he is dressed as an African chieftain, complete with reebock skull]
The Boys
Hey, Chef.
Chef
All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries.
Kyle
Uh, Chef?
Chef
Or haaauuunted hash browns.
Kyle
Chef.
Chef
And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!
Kyle
Chef.
Chef
And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
Kyle
Chef!
Chef
What?!
Kyle
We have problems!
Chef
Well, what's the first problem?
Stan
Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
Chef
Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem? [Kyle points to Cartman, but now there are two of him. They blink together.] Oh, nohoho. [rubs his eyes] Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!
Cafeteria dining area. The five boys and Chef are sitting at a table.
Cartman
...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!
Evil Cartman
I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too.
Chef
Exactly what do you remember?
Evil Cartman
Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car.
Chef
Of course! That's it!
Stan
What?
Chef
Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!
Cartman
He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
Kyle
Will you stop saying that word?!
Stan
Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
Chef
Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!
Evil Cartman
This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef.
Chef
How do you mean?
Evil Cartman
In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman.
Chef's jaw drops.
Stan's house, daytime. The boys enter the living room and Stan places his fish on a small desk next to the sofa. Aunt Flo greets them.
Aunt Flo
[shaking] Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo.
Kyle
Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
Stan
[taps Kyle, then softly] Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
Cartman
Ey, sweet! [hops on her lap] Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.
Stan
Cartman!
Cartman
Dude, this is hella cool.
Stan
Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
Aunt Flo
Nn-oh. [Cartman hops off and rejoins the boys] I got it from the pet store, Stanley.
Stan
Do you remember what pet store?
Aunt Flo
Let's see. I believe it was called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store," just outside of town.
Stan
Where?
Aunt Flo
I know I have the address written down somewhere. [Stan turns and takes Kyle aside] Let me look.
Stan
That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
Cartman
Who's "we"? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
Evil Cartman
I'll help you, Stan.
Cartman
Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
Kyle
Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
Stan
Just help me take it back. Come on! [walks to Aunt Flo, who's now dead on the floor] Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
Sharon
[rushing in] Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo! [holds her hands to her face]
Stan
It was the fish! [points to it]
Sharon
[dragging Aunt Flo, mutters] Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. [the fish swims around]
Stan
Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
Kyle
There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. [the fish jumps out and somehow pulls Kenny into the tank head first.]
Stan
Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. [Kenny starts to gargle as the fish gives him the blender treatment. The water turns blood red as Kenny spins in the tank]
Kyle
Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
Evil Cartman
Can do!
Cartman
Screw you! [the fish spits Kenny's corpse out of the tank and jumps back in. Kenny's left eye is gone and the water is clear]
Sharon
[returning] It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh! [sees Kenny's corpse and reacts frantically. Rats rush in to munch on it] I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! [drags Kenny away. The fish looks on]
Stan
[to Kyle] Come on, we're running out of time. [both walk by Randy trying to open a door]
Randy
[turns around] Hey, why is the basement door locked? [turns back and keeps trying]
The Marsh basement. Officer Barbrady is still tied up.
Officer Barbrady
-crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care

Cartman's house. Both Cartmans are seated on the sofa. Evil Cartman has the phone book, Cartman has a pot pie.
Evil Cartman
I don't see any pet stores called "Indian Burial Ground."
Cartman
Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
Announcer
And now, back to the Terrance and Phillip Halloween Special.
Terrance
[both are dressed as ghosts] (Fart)
Phillip
[long pause] That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. [both pull out little daggers and stab each other as they laugh. Small spurts of blood ensue.]
Cartman
Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! [slaps his thigh]
Evil Cartman
[looks up] What's so funny about that?
Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!
Evil Cartman
[picks up Kitty] Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. [Kitty is purring loudly, happily now. Cartman is not amused.]
Cartman
NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!! [Evil Cartman is startled as Kitty jumps away.] Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.
Night time, the Marsh house. Stan and Kyle are on the sofa. Sharon enters with another woman.
Sharon
Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
Mrs. McCormick
[approaches him] You saw him, didn't you? [Sharon mouths and waves "no" to Stan] You saw my boy. [sits down on the sofa between the boys]
Stan
Yeah, my goldfish-.
Sharon
Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.
Mrs. McCormick
[cradling Stan, distraught] My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was.
Stan
I know.
Mrs. McCormick
You've gotta tell me what happened to him! [holds Stan up and throttles him] You have to know something!
Sharon
[intervening] Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!
Mrs. McCormick
That's right, I'm a little drunk. [Sharon escorts her to the door] You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy. [Evil Cartman enters as the women reach the door] My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh.
Evil Cartman
[at the sofa] You guys, I found the pet store!
Stan
Come on, let's go! [takes the fish with him and stops before Sharon] Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!
Sharon
I believe you, sweetheart. [Stan goes outside, and she addresses Kyle and Evil Cartman] Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!
A stormy night, at the pet store. The remains of a covered wagon are next to it. The three boys enter.
Clerk
Can I help you boys?
Stan
I wanna return a fish.
Clerk
[pounds the counter with both fists] Damn it!
Kyle
What?
Clerk
That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it? [holds his palms out] Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?
Stan
Yeah, dude.
Clerk
Damn it! [pounds with the right fist] Just like all the other returns! [the camera pulls back to show them. They all groan and have red, evil eyes. One bird blinks, and its eyes glow]
Kyle
Dude, why is your store called "The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"
Clerk
Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it.
Stan
So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
Clerk
Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down.
Stan
Why?
Clerk
Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
Clerk
We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
Clerk
Well, that certainly would explain a lot.
Kyle
Like what?
Clerk
Well, like this. [opens a door marked, "Employees Only." A bright, flashing portal appears] I've been wondering what the hell this was.
Stan's house. Randy finally opened the door to the basement and brings down some items.
Officer Barbrady
Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you. [Randy turns to see Officer Barbrady, then rushes up the stairs] Okay, bye, then.
The kitchen. Sharon is preparing cookie dough. Randy enters.
Randy
Sharon?
Sharon
Yes, hon?
Randy
There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
Sharon
[rolling the dough] Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. [begins cutting out cookies in star shapes.]
Randy
[ponders] Why'd you take his pants off? [long pause. Sharon makes more cookies] Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?
Sharon
[sobs. Randy comes over] Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore.
Randy
What is it?
Sharon
I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again.
Randy
Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?
Back at the pet store.
Stan
Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
Cler
I can't give you your money back.
Stan
I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
Clerk
No! I won't take it back!
Evil Cartman
Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, "Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe." Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly [pounds his right hand with his left fist], you're gonna take this fish back.
Clerk
All right, you win.
Stan
Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! [the clerk takes the fish from Stan]
Evil Cartman
[turns to face the clerk again] And sir, can I make a suggestion? [the clerk looks at him] Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace.
Kyle
You kick ass, evil Cartman!
Stan
Yeah!
Kyle
You know what I like best about you? You don't say, "hella," like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! [the boys exit the store, and the skies are clear]
Evil Cartman
No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer. [the clerk puts the fish up on a shelf and the employee door opens, the doorway glowing brightly]
Clerk
[recoils] What the-? [two figures appear: Evil Stan and Evil Kyle]
Evil Stan
He was here! Cartman was just here!
Clerk
Who are you?
Evil Kyle
We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?
Clerk
I don't know who you mean?
Evil Kyle
[pulls out a big bat] Maybe this will jog your memory! [starts releasing the evil returns by bashing in the cages]
Clerk
No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
Several identical images of Barbra flash through space, one of them towards the camera, and the boys are walking down Main Street.
Stan
I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
Evil Cartman
Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest.
Kyle
Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
Evil Cartman
Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
Stan
You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
Kyle
Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say "hella."
Evil Cartman
Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. [the boys turn to see a man attacked by two dogs, a cat, two ducks, and a vulture]
The boys resume walking].
Kyle
Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
Evil Cartman
Let's use Kenny's squash.
Stan
Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
Cartman's house. Cartman is watching TV in the dark. Onscreen, Phillip is in a cemetery standing next to a tombstone that might be Terrance's, and has three roses in his hand.
Terrance
[as a ghost, walks up to Phillip] Boo!
Phillip
[jumps up] Aaaaagh!
Cartman
Aw, man, this movie is hella scary. [click. The front door flies open and Evil Stan and Evil Kyle burst in]
Evil Stan
Aha! There you are, Cartman!
Cartman
P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
Evil Kyle
We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!
Cartman
Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
Evil Stan
[he and Evil Kyle look at each other, then] Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman?
Cartman
What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum. [checks them off] I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
Evil Kyle
[he and Evil Stan go over to grab him] Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe!
Cartman
Don't touch me! [punches Evil Stan, who releases him]
Evil Stan
What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us!
Evil Kyle
Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!
Cartman
Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
Evil Stan
Yes!
Cartman
Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. [leads them out the door]
At the Pumpkin Carving Contest. Mayor McDaniels is dressed as a Puritan woman. Johnson holds a ball on a platter. They are on stage, which is adorned with two spiderwebs and a bat in each one.
Mayor McDaniels
And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! "The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"
Stan
[the crowd cheers] We won, dude!
Evil Cartman
Hooray!
Mayor McDaniels
You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball!
Evil Cartman
Oh, no! [spots Cartman, Evil Stan and Evil Kyle] Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back!
Stan
Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! [the two groups face each other]
Cartman
[to Evil Kyle] Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!
Kyle
Stop saying "hella," Cartman!
Evil Stan
[to Evil Cartman] Thought you could get away from us, huh, Cartman?!
Evil Cartman
[pleading] Please!
Kyle
Leave him alone, butthole!
Evil Kyle
Shut your trap, kid!
Stan
Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
Cartman
Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!
Evil Stan
It's time, Cartman! Prepare for gingerification! [sets the gun]
Evil Cartman
Well, good-bye, you guys. It's been fun. [Stan and Kyle look down. The evil pets return to South Park and start attacking the townsfolk. They scream as they are being attacked.]
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, what now?!
Kyle
It's the evil pets [the attack continues, and a vulture knocks the gingerification gun out of Evil Stan's hands.]
Evil Stan
The gingerification gun!
Stan
[picks it up] Get to the stage! [Stan, Kyle, and Evil Cartman rush up. Stan's spooky fish attacks a man and kills him]
Sharon
[seeing what just happened] Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!
Evil Stan
[all six boys are on stage] Give me that gun, kid!
Stan
Up yours, evil twin! [zaps him back to the evil, parallel universe.]
Evil Stan
[shrinks as Evil Kyle watches] Noooooo! [vanishes]
Evil Kyle
[zapped, he shrinks too] Noooooo! [vanishes]
Cartman
All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
Stan
Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. [takes aim]
Cartman
What?!
Kyle
We can't deal with you saying "hella" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! [Cartman takes on Evil Cartman, and both wrestle. Cartman rips off Evil Cartman's mustache and beard, and kicks him. Both of them then stand up, indistinguishable. Stan pulls the gingerification gun back]
Kyle
Which one is the good Cartman?
Both Cartmans
I am!
Stan
Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
Kyle
Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
Both Cartmans
[pointing to the other one] He is!
Cartman on Left
Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both.
Cartman on Right
What?!
Cartman on Left
It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world.
Cartman on Right
[Stan zaps him] Noooo! Screw you guys! [disappears]
Cartman on Left
How did you guys know?
Stan
Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
Cartman
Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
Kyle
Oh no, dude!
Stan
You tricked us, Cartman!
Cartman
That's right, I did!
You guys are hella stupid
You guys are hella lame
You guys are hella dumb
Hella hella hella!

Kyle
Damn it!
On the street, Randy walks with Officer Barbrady. The evil pets are still attacking the townsfolk.
Randy
I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
Officer Barbrady
Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor.
Randy
Uuuh, do you want your pants back?
Officer Barbrady
No. Just leave me with my dignity. [turns around and walks into the crowd] Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here.
'[End of "Spooky Fish." Cartman sings "Best Friends"]'
End of Spookyfish

Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!
The Marsh house. The family is in the living room.
Sharon
The answer is "no", Stanley!
Stan
But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
Sharon
I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays.
Stan
But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
Sharon
I'll leave it up to your father.
Randy
[shrugs] Eh, it's fine with me.
Sharon
[ignoring him] The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!
Stan
I don't want your lame-ass supper!
Shelly
Ew! You're gonna get it now.
Sharon
[pointing to her right] Go to your room, Stanley! Right now! [Randy's angry now. Stan walks to his room and shuts the door]
Stan
[retrieving a backpack from his closet] Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old! [goes to his window, opens it, and stands on the sill] I don't need this stupid family anyway! [drops to the ground outside and leaves]
Outside the Cartman house. Liane is packing the boys' gear into her station wagon. Kyle's parents and Kenny's parents are seeing them off.
Sheila
It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
Liane
Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends.
Cartman
[to Kyle] Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a big present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.
Kyle
That's nice, Cartman.
Stuart
[on bended knee, to Kenny] Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?
Kenny
(Okay)
Stan
[walking up] Okay, let's go!
Cartman
Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan.
Stan
'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!
Sheila
[Kyle walks away] Goodbye, bubbe! Be careful!
Stuart
[waving to Kenny] See you in a couple of days, son.
Cartman
[rushing past Kyle, who joins Stan on the back seat] Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun! [opens the door, only to find Kenny already there. They look at each other] Kenny, I called it shotgun! [Kenny stares back] Dammit, Kenny, get in the back! [Kenny moves not. Cartman points to the right] Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there. [no movement. Cartman points to the road] Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade! [Kenny is not moved. Cartman reaches into his pocket and pulls out a dollar] Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! [throws the bill away], Go get it! [Kenny hops out and Cartman jumps in] ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap. [Kenny gets the bill and hops into the back seat. Lo and behold, there is an elephant parade, with clowns and jugglers and... Liane drives off]
Stan
So, how far is it to Nebraska?
Liane
Around six hours.
Kyle
Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
Liane
Well, I've got an idea. We could sing.
Stan
Yeah. Or, we could not.
Cartman
Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?
Liane
Over the meadow and through the woods
Liane and Cartman:
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow...

4 HOURS LATER.
Liane and Cartman:
Over the meadow and through the woods
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh

Kyle
Please stop.
Liane and Cartman:
Through white and drifted snow
Kyle
[insistent] Please stop!
Liane and Cartman:
Over the meadow and through the woods,
To Grandmother's house we go

Cartman
[Kyle angrily kicks him into the dashboard] Argh!
Liane
Ooo, careful hon. These roads are bumpy.
Cartman
[rubbing his nose] I guess, damn! [some traffic is seen]
Liane
Here we go, kids. We're crossing the state line into Nebraska. [Stan and Kyle go to Kenny's window to check it out. The first sign they see says, "Now leaving Colorful Colorado," on a mountain background with rainbow. The scenery changes abruptly from snow-covered mountains to fields of wheat. Once they pass the state line they see "You are now in NEBRASKA. ...Sorry." Nothing is seen on the horizon]
Stan
This is Nebraska?
Kyle
What's all that stuff?
Liane
Wheat. The building block of your favorite foods, and, Nebraska's principal source of economic productivity. You see, when Nebraska first became--
Cartman
We don't care, Mom.
Kyle
Hey, look! [enunciating a billboard] See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
Stan
[now seated] Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
Kyle
[now seated] I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
Cartman
Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.
Kyle
It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
Liane
That shouldn't be a problem. Eric's Grandma is right near the mall.
Kyle
Cool!
Cartman
How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
Liane
About another hour, hon.
Cartman
Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so [angrily] I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
Liane
Now, Eric, let's try to get out of that grumpy mood before we get to Grandma's.
Liane and Cartman:
Over the meadow and through the woods
Liane and Cartman:
To Grandmother's house we go
Kyle
Oh, God! [Stan is dejected]
Liane and Cartman:
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow...

Later... Cartman's Grandma's house. Cartman's singing is heard approaching.
Cartman
Over the meadow and through the woods...
Liane
[stops the car] Here we are. [the boys pour out]
Kyle
Jesus Christ, finally!
Cartman
[runs to the front door] Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma! [knocks, rubs his hands together, and an elderly man opens the door. The boys come up behind Cartman]
Man
Oh, it's little Eric!
Cartman
Hi, Grandpa!
Grandpa
Look at how big you've gotten!
Grandma
Hi, Eric. Grandma got you a present.
Cartman
Sweet. What is it?
Grandma
It's inside.
Cartman
Yes! Move it! [shoves Grandma off the porch. She screams on the way down]
Liane
[now inside with the boys] Hello everyone. Happy Holidays!
Everyone
[seven people] Hello!
Liane
These are Eric's friends: Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Boys, let me introduce you to the Cartman family. This is Uncle Stinky.
Uncle Stinky:
[brown curly hair, goatee, Fu Manchu mustache] Nice to have you heuh.
Liane
Aunt Lisa, Cousin Fred, Cousin Alexandra [not shown], Fat Bob, Jimmy [bulldog], and great-grandma Florence. [with walker]
Florence
[Kyle recoils as she approaches the boys] Come here, Eric. Give your great-grandma some huggies. [grabs Kyle and lifts him up]
Kyle
Agghh!
Liane
No, no, Florence, that's not Eric.
Florence
[releases Kyle] Oh, which one is he, then?
Stan
[pointing] He's the fat one.
Grandma
He's not fat, he's big-boned.
Cartman
[in sync] I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech.
Kyle
[to Stan] That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
Stan
Sick, dude.
Cartman
Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?
Grandma
Here you go, Eric. Hap-py Holidays! [He gleefully rips it open]
Cartman
[not pleased] Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! [lifts it out]
Grandma
Yes. I thought that would look really good on you.
Cartman
[really upset] Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!
The dining room. The thirteen are seated around it. The TV is at the foot of the table, on its own chair.
Grandpa
Well, this is what the holidays are about. Family.
Stan
[dissenting] Yeah, right!
Grandpa
Well, what does your family do for the holidays, Stan?
Stan
My family's dead! [Uncle Stinky, a baby, and Aunt Lisa gasp.]
Liane
[turns to him, hand to lips] Ooh, I'm sorry to hear that, Stanley.
Kyle
Dude, your family died?
Stan
They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
I can't believe I got a stupid shirt! [he didn't have to wear it...] The holidays are bullcrap!
Liane
Here, Kyle. Will you hold Great-Grandma's catheter bag during dinner? [places it in front of him]
Kyle
What is this??
Liane
[in his ear] Great-grandma has a bladder problem. This helps her out.
Kyle
[eyes shut] Sick, dude!
Liane
[now seated] Eric, did you say 'hi' to your little cousin Elvin?
Cartman
[flatly] Hi, cousin Elvin.
Elvin
[the baby, sucking on a Fudgecicle] Sweet.
Grandpa
[tapping knife on wine glass] Well, it certainly is nice we could all gather heuh for the holidays. Even Uncle Howard has joined us live via satellite from the state penitentiary. [the TV screen shows Uncle Howard at his own table, with a small meal]
Kyle
Whoa, dude! [Stan is surprised]
Grandma
You look good, Howard.
Howard
No I don't!
Liane
Hi, Howard.
Stan
[to Cartman] Dude, is he here every year like this?
Cartman
Yup!
Elvin
[tosses his Fudgecicle at the TV, and it slides down the screen] Sweet.
Kyle
[Great-Grandma urinates into the bag. He grimaces] Aaww!
Howard
Come on, let's eat already! They gave me extra bread and water!
Grandma
Where's your manners, Howard? We haven't even said grace yet. Mom, will you do the honors of saying grace?
Florence
God-damn it, why the hell do I always have to say grace? If one more person asks me to say grace, I'll be like, "Eh! I'm not saying grace! And if you ask me again, I'll kick you square [jabs the fork in the air] in the nuts!"
Cartman
Amen. [his feelings exactly]
All
Ah-men. [all dig into the food. Bits and pieces being to fly everywhere]
Kyle
[watching the mess] Jesus, dude! [Kenny stuffs his food into a paper bag, and Jimmy growls longingly]
Grandpa
No, Jimmy, this is my pot pie! [Jimmy growls] No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!
Cartman
Bad Jimmy!
Grandma
No, Jimmy, that's Grandpa's pot pie! [Stan and Kyle stare in awe. Jimmy growls, and a hail of "No, Jimmy! That's a bad Jimmy!"s descends on him]
Stan
Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
Kyle
I know what you mean. [Kenny packs the last of his meal away]
Night time. The boys are asleep in the basement.
Kyle
[jumps up] Arrggh! [Stan wakes up]
Stan
What, dude? [Cartman wakes up]
Kyle
Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
Stan
Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
Kyle
Oh. Arrggh! [thump. Kenny's awake. More sounds, of breaking glass.]
Stan
What was that?
Kyle
I heard it, too.
Cartman
Whatever it is, it's getting closer. [Stan pinches him] Ow! What the hell was that for!
Stan
I wanted to make sure we're not dreaming. [Kyle walks behind Stan and punches Cartman]
Cartman
Ow!
Kyle
[moving back to his sleeping bag] I wanted to make sure, too.
Cartman
Yuhwell, you're not dreaming! [Kenny flies at him with a punch] Ey! Cut the crap!
Kyle
Dude, it's coming through the window! [the window flies open and light streams in. A fat figure jumps in and the kids scream. Cartman goes for the light switch and the light goes on. A surprised prison escapee is what he sees]
Cartman
Uncle Howard!
Uncle Howard:
Oh. Hey, Eric. I didn't think anybody'd be down here.
Cartman
Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!
Stan
We thought you were in jail.
Howard
Yeah, well I'b I busted out. [shows off the broken cuff chain]
Cartman
Wow, cool!
Howard
Sshhhh! You can't let the rest of the family know I'm here.
Cartman
Okay.
Howard
If it's okay, we're just gonna hang out here for a couple of days with you kids.
Cartman
Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
Howard
[turning to the window] Come on up, it's okay. [another man pops up and makes his was in] Another inmate busted out with me. Don't worry, he's a good guy.
Inmate
[turns around] Oh, hi boys. I'm Charlie. Charlie Manson. [the boys express some shock, but then fall silent]
The next day. Manson looks out the window.
Manson
I can't wait to get out among the pigs [turns to Howard] and raise some hell.
Howard
All right, Chuck, but we gotta lay low for a while.
Manson
When I stand up on the mountain and say, "Do it!", it gets done! And it it don't get done, then I'll move on it! And that's the last thing in the world you want me to do.
Howard
All right, Chuck. Let's watch some TV or something. [Manson sits before the TV and turns it on.]
Announcer
Now back to, "It's A Wonderful Life".
George Bailey:
You-oo you just can't buy people, Mr. Potter, wuh. Why, you know what you are? You're a little bitch. [Potter looks up] That's right, you're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?
Stan
[snaps his fingers] Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
Cartman
[waking] What?
Kyle
We have to go see Mr. Hankey at the mall, Cartman.
Cartman
[putting his coat on over his BEEFCAKE muscle shirt] All right, keeps your pants on.
Howard
Hey, bring us down some food, all right?
Cartman
[follows the boys up the stairs] Okay. [puts on his cap]
The living room. Football is on.
Stinky
[eating popcorn] Come on, Team!
Cartman
Can somebody drive us to the mall?
Announcer
Touchdown!
The Adults:
Yeah!
Cartman
[insistent] Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?
Announcer
And these Cornhuskers have the ball on the 50-yard line!
Cartman
[pops up in front of Stinky] Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?
Stinky
Not now, Eric. [notices a play] Hold him! He has him! Where's the flag?!
Cartman
Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!
Stinky
I said "no," and I mean "no!" Respect my authorituh!
Cartman
[leaves grumbling] Damn his Goddamned authorituh!
Announcer
With only 16 seconds left, the Cornhu-
SPECIAL REPORT.
Reporter
We interrupt this broadcast for a news bulletin.
Stinky
What?!
Reporter
["NEBRASKA NEWS"] Mass murderer and extremely nasty person Charles Manson has escaped from prison! Manson was the man responsible for seven murders in the late '60's. Manson has never shown any signs of remorse for his crimes. If you see Manson, please kick his ass and smash his fucking face in for me, and then call the police. And now back to the game.
Announcer
And they've done it! They've scored 16 unanswered points in 15 seconds! [NEB 23, ARK 16]
The Adults:
Oh, weak!
Grandma
[the boys walk past her] Eric, I need you to take care of your cousin Elvin for a while.
Cartman
I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
Grandma
Won't yo do it for Grandma?
Cartman
All right. Give me $10. [she reaches into her purse and gives it to him]
Elvin
[licking another Fudgecicle] Kick ass!
The basement. Manson is still watching the TV.
George Bailey
Oh, Mary. Mary, you're real!
Howard
Chuck, can you turn that thing down?
George Bailey:
Hello, movie house! ["Gone With The Wind" is playing there] Hello, burger parlor!
Manson
You know what the spirit of Christmas is? It's another lie, from the lyin' pigs that consider me the witness-!
Howard
Okay, Chuck! Thank you very much!
Cartman
[coming down the stairs with his friends and Elvin] My family sucks ass!
Kyle
Yeah, they do!
Stan
All families suck ass!
Cartman
Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns. [hands the bag to Howard]
Howard
[digging in] Wow, sweet!
Manson
Heyyy!
Kyle
Dude, we have to get to the mall!!
Elvin
You guys, seriously!
Howard
What's the matter?
Cartman
My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.
Howard
Oh, bummer.
Manson
I'll take you! [a heavy note sounds]
Howard
Uh, that's okay, Chuck. You just keep watching Christmas specials.
Manson
Hey, I didn't bust out of prison to be locked up in somebody's basement! I want some action!
Kyle
Good for you, Charlie!
Manson
[to Cartman] Come on! I'll hot-wire your Grandpa's car!
Stan
Do you really think we should go with this guy?
Cartman
Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. [walks away]
Outside. The boys, Manson, and Elvin head for the station wagon.
Manson
All right, boys, keep your heads down! [they get into the wagon, Manson hot-wires it, and steps on the gas] We're goin' to the mall!
Boys
Hooray!
South Park, the Marsh house.
Sharon
I just can't believe he would go without our permission!
Randy
Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.
Sharon
Well, I hope for his sake you're right. [calls Liane]
Liane
Hello?
Sharon
Hello, Ms. Cartman. It's Sharon, Stan's mother. Did Stanley go up there to Nebraska with you?
Liane
Oh, why yes he did. I thought you were dead, Sharon.
Sharon
Wwhat?!
Liane
Stanley told me you had passed on. I'm glad to see that you're better.
Sharon
[irate. Shelly is now present] Get the car, Randy! We're going to Nebraska!
Shelly
Ooooo, Stan's in trouble!
Mall of Nebraska.
Kyle
[jumping up and down to get a better look] Do you see him?
Stan
Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
Kyle
I can't wait to see him! [a kid looks back] He's gonna be so glad we came!
Kid
I drove all the way from Montana to see Mr. Hankey.
Kyle
That's nice, kid. I knew Mr. Hankey before he was even famous.
Cartman
How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff. [a display is seen of Mr. Hankey caps, T-shirts, cups, figurines, and posters]
Elvin
Mr. Hankey kicks ass!
Cartman
And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
Kyle
So?!
Cartman
So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?
Kyle
Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. [Charlie Manson and Kenny stare at each other. The line moves up]
Manson
[to Kenny] How would you like to come with me to a more secluded part of the mall?
Kenny
(Okay) [they walk off]
Stan
I really like that guy.
Cartman
Oh, it looks like you finished your Fudgecicle, Elvin. [Elvin looks at his hands and sees nothing to lick, then begins to cry] God damnit, be quiet, Elvin! Shut up, Elvin! [grabs a stick and whacks him on the back of the head. Elvin is now catatonic, but manages a blink] No, Elvin, bad Elvin! [seeing that Elvin is not responding, he looks around]
Sweet Box, your music box headquarters. Manson and Kenny are looking around.
Manson
[explaining things to Kenny] Folks need to understand that I am terror! I am fear! I am-! Oh, hey look, another holiday special.
Voice-over:
And now, back to "The Grinchy Poo" [a shot of Grinchy Poo stealing a decorated tree]
Narrator
Grinchy Poo went up the chimney and stuffed the tree up
But then he heard a coo, like the cry of a dove
It was little Cindy Lou Poo, who was no more than two
"Mr. Hankey, why? Why are you taking our Christmas tree, why?"
And Old Grinchy Poo thought of a line, and he thought it up quick...

Lollyland. a mall worker dressed as a Hankey elf, covered in Hankey kisses, approaches the boys.
Hankey Elf:
All right, boys, you're up next. Welcome to Mr. Hankey's Happy Lollyland! [voice dripping with bitterness]
Kyle
[elated] Hoh, boy. Here we go!
Mall Hankey:
Howdy ho, boys.
Stan
[after a pause] Mr. Hankey? [his elves lift the boys onto Hankey's lap]
Mall Hankey:
Gosh, you boys smell like flowers.
Kyle
You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
Mall Hankey:
Sure I am! Howdy ho!
Stan
You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
Mall Hankey:
Well, Mr. Hankey has to grow too, you know. Howdy ho!
Hankey Elf:
You boys want your picture with Mr. Hankey?
Kyle
This is not Mr. Hankey! [a picture is taken] This is a fake! [gasps from other kids and adults. A boy cries]
Mall Hankey:
It's okay, kids. I'm real. Hoowwdy ho!
Kids
[a crowd now, they wave back] Hoowwdy ho!
Kyle
Why are you people doing this? Why would you lie like this? To children?
Mall Hankey:
[softly] Look, kid. There's Mr. Hankeys like me in every shopping mall. There is no real Mr. Hankey.
Kyle
[insulted] What?! What did you say?!
Stan
Oh, boy. You've done it now.
Mall Hankey:
Huh??
Kyle
[stands and rips off the mall Hankey's helmet] Behold! Here's your false prophet!
Kids
[gasp] Boo! [throw plastic Hankey's at the mall Hankey]
Mall Hankey:
Ow!
Kids
Die!
Mall Hankey:
Ow!
Kid 1:
Get out! [the kids rush the chair and attack Hankey and his elves]
Kids
[background] You son of a bitch! Rip it down! Get out!
Girl
You lied to me, Mother. You said it was the real Mr. Hankey.
Mother
Uh, well, yes, but-
Girl
I will not forget this, Mother. I will not forget this, ever. [turns and walks away]
Kid
This is revolution! [more rioting. Two kids prepare a Molotov cocktail. The blond kid lights it, the one in yellow-trimmed blue cap chucks it at the Lollyland setup. It goes up in flames]
Mall Hankey:
[getting out of the way] Wah-hahow!
Security Guard 1:
Uh oh, they're rioting again. [the other guard raises an eyebrow. Three kids smash a bench into an electronics store window. Two of them take a TV and the third goes further inside]
Back at the Sweet Box...
Narrator
And all the poos down in Pooville joined hands and they sang
They sang all the same
And he himself, the Grinchy Poo, carved the roast poo.

Manson
[pleased with the special] Wow, man. That's beautiful. He was evil, but now he's good. [Kenny looks at him]
At what was Lollyland. A battering ram comes through a wall and everyone scatters. Police in riot gear pour in behind it.
Officer 1:
What's happening?
Officer 2:
Some kid must have said it wasn't the real Mr. Hankey again. [the kids and the officers race at each other and do battle. The kid in yellow-trimmed blue cap leaves this graffiti on the wall: "No more lies!" and runs away. Am officer gives chase. Another officer pumps a tear gas canister into the crowd and the kids fall from the resulting gas]
Cartman
[the boys regroup] I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!
Manson
[arriving] Well, how was it?
Kyle
It was a fake!
Manson
Oh, I'm sorry.
Kyle
Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
Stan
Where did you go, Uncle Charlie?
Manson
Uh, I went to a beauty parlor and had my tattoo redone. [a happy face replaced the swastika] Look!
Cartman
Oh, uh that's pretty cool.
Stan
Hey. Where's Kenny?
Manson
Oh. He's... around.
Kenny
[arriving] (Hey, you guys. I'm right here.)
Stan
Oh, hey Kenny.
Manson
Come on, I'll buy you kids an orange Smoothie.
The Boys:
Ooooo!
Officer
Hey, there he is! That's Charlie Manson! [the officer rush towards him]
Manson
Run for your lives, boys! [no time for a Smoothie. All head for the mall doors and rush out to the station wagon]
Cartman
[outside, falling behind with Elvin] Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously. [the officers follow]
Officer
Come back here, God damnit! [Manson and the boys get in the station wagon and Manson backs up all the way to the highway, jumping the curb] He's getting away! [the officers get into their cars and pursue Manson]
Manson
Keep your heads down, kids! [an officer fires into the wagon and the back window breaks]
Cartman
Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Kyle
I can't believe they would put a fake Mr. Hankey in a mall! If Mr. Hankey ever found out, he'd be so pissed!
Grandma's house. A news bulletin is heard.
Announcer
We interrupt this program for a breaking news story.
Reporter
A high speed car chase is happening right now on interstate 3. We go now to our live sky-fi helicopter.
Sky-fi Reporter:
Ron, it looks as though the chase is proceeding west down the interstate.
Grandma
Oh, that looks a lot like your car, Harold.
Sky-fi Reporter:
We understand that Charles Manson is inside the car with several hostages, all of whom are children [Manson sideswipes another car, which loses control and stops. The police drive around it] My God, what is this world coming to? Well, we'd like to take a moment to tell you that this car chase is being brought to you by Snacky S'mores [a beaver roasting one appears], the creamy bonbon s'mores in a delightful cookie crunch.
The highway. More shots taken at the wagon.
Manson
They're gaining on us! [more shots, and Elvin tosses his Fudgecicle out]
Officer
Fudgecicle! [swerves to avoid it. Two other patrol cars jump over his and burst into flame upon landing]
Elvin
Kickass! [other cars take up the pursuit and fire at Manson]
Kyle
God, I hate the holiday season! [more shots]
Manson pulls into Grandma's driveway. Grandma stands outside.
Grandma
[the kids rush past her] Oh, hello kids. Having fun-?
Manson
Get in the house!
Grandma
Alrighty, then. [walks in as the cops pull up]
Cartman
Lock the door! [Terrance and Phillip are on]
Big Blonde:
Oh my God, it's Charlie Manson! Whoa!
Harold
What's going on?
Stan
There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
Stinky
Quiet down, we're watching television. [Terrance and Phillip laugh]
Terrance
Oh, Phillip, what a precious gift! [opens it]
Phillip
That's right, Terrance. This is the season for sharing. [farts on the gift, and both laugh]
Howard
[appears with rifle in hand] The cops are here!
Grandma
Howard!
Harold
How did you get out, son?
Outside. The officers have hunkered down.
Police Chief:
[on the bullhorn] All right, Manson, we know you're in there! Come out peacefully, and we'll shoot you!
Officer
[whispers into the chief's ear] Tell him we won't shoot him, Boss.
Police Chief:
[whispers back] Oh, yeah. That's a good idea. [on the bullhorn] Come out peacefully, and we won't shoot you! [Howard and Grandma peek out]
Grandma
Oh, look. Police Chief Stevens got a new haircut.
Howard
[points the rifle at her] Get down, Ma!
Manson
Hey, man, don't point a gun at your own mother!
Howard
What the hell is wrong with you, Manson? You're acting all funny! Everybody just sit down and shut up! We're not going back to the big house!
Harold
Well, Howard, you've done it again! You've ruined Christmas!
Outside Grandma's house. The press shows up.
Field Reporter:
This is Robert Pooner reporting live from Nebraska, where escaped convict Charlie Manson has walled himself up in a house. [the camera zooms in on Grandma's house] We understand that there are hostages, and that the situation is critical, [zoom out], so we would like to remind you all that this live hostage crisis is being brought to you by Palmoral Sun Block [SPF 200]. Remember, if it isn't Palmoral, you're gonna get cancer.
Off camera, the Marshes drive up and get out. Sharon approaches the police.
Sharon
What's going on here?!
Chief Stevens:
We've got a critical situation, ma'am. Charlie Manson is holding everybody inside hostage.
Sharon
Is this the Cartman residence?
Chief Stevens:
Yes, ma'am.
Sharon
Give me that! [grabs the bullhorn and] Stanley! This is your mother!
Inside
Stan
Oh ooh.
Kyle
What's your mom doing here, dude?
Sharon
[outside] Young man, I have had it! You have disobeyed me for the last time! [Grandma, Howard and Manson look out the window. They turn to face Stan.]
Howard
Wow, she's really pissed.
Manson
[pointing] I'm glad I'm not you right now, kid.
Outside.
Sharon
What do you have to say for yourself, Stanley?!
Stan
[from inside the house] ...Sorry.
Robert Pooner:
Still more developments in the Manson hostage crisis. Uh, it appears now that eight-year-old Stan Marsh [picture shown] is in BIG, big trouble. He apparently disobeyed his parents, left home without telling them, and uh, Tom, his- his mother is very disappointed with him.
Howard
Damn it! What are we gonna do?
Florence
Sshhhh! We're watching television.
Terrance and Phillip are teasing a reindeer with a red nose - Rudolph. Terrance runs up and farts on its face, and the deer flinches. Terrance runs back as both men laugh.
Phillip
[running up] Waitwaitwaitwait. [farts on Rudolph's rear and runs back laughing]
Terrance
[running up] Check out this one. [farts on Rudolph's face and runs back laughing]
Phillip
[running up] Hold on, hold on. Over here, over here. [farts on Rudolph's rear and runs back laughing]
Terrance
[running up] Okay, here I come, okay. [farts on Rudolph's face and runs back laughing]
Phillip
[running up] Okay, waitwait waitwait. [farts on Rudolph's rear and runs back laughing]
The living room.
Chief Stevens:
[outside, with bullhorn] Come out with your hands up!
Howard
Damnit, Dad, why didn't you put a back door on this house?!
Harold
Well, there's that old window in the bathroom; you could probably squeeze through there.
Howard
That's it! We're going out the bathroom window! Come on, Manson!
Manson
But I gotta see what happens.
Howard
Come on, damn it! [Manson hurries, panting] Well, it's good seeing you all. Don't move until we're gone or I'll shoot you dead. Happy holidays.
The Adults:
Happy holidays. [Uncle Howard and Manson leave]
Stan
[walks to the window, looks out, sees his parents, then turns to Kyle] Dude, they're gonna kill me.
Police Chief Stevens:
[outside] All right, Manson, this is it! We're coming in after you! There's gonna be a lot of bloodshed, and a lot of innocent people are gonna die! You've got until 100-Marshmallow to come out!
Officer
1-Marshmallow, 2-Marshmallow,...
The bathroom. Howard works on the window.
Howard
["3, Marshmallow," The window opens] All right, it's open! Let's go!
Stan
[walking in] 'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
Manson
Huh?!
Stan
Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
Manson
But Stan, your mother and father are out there!
Stan
I know! They've come to punish me. All they wanna do is make me pay for comin' to Nebraska in the first place.
Howard
All right, kid, you can come. Now, let's go. [starts going through the window. Stan steps on the toilet seat, but Manson stops him.]
Manson
Stan, I wanna talk to you about family. [Uncle Howard is out.]
Stan
What?!
Howard
[popping up] What?!
Manson
You see, I had a family once. At least, I called them my family. Really, they were nothin' but a gang of people I thought were my friends. Ah after we killed a bunch of people together, I realized that my real family was who took care of me, and who took the time to care about what I did.
Stan
But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
Manson
If they don't care about you, would they have driven nine hours to Nebraska?
Stan
[pondering] I guess you're right, Uncle Charlie. Thanks. [they hug]
Howard
Now can we go??
Manson
No, Howard. You go ahead. I've got something to say. [walks out the bathroom door]
Howard
Oh, weak!
The living room. Manson walks in.
Manson
Folks, I apologize for this whole mess. I'm going to surrender. Somebody show the police a white flag.
Outside. The countdown continues.
Officer
[on the bullhorn] 90-Marshmallow, 91-Marshmallow [to Police Chief Stevens] This is making me hungry for marshmallows [on the bullhorn] 92-Marshmallow [the front door opens and the police get into positions. The flag appears, followed by Kenny, carrying it]
Chief Stevens:
Look out, he's got a white flag! [his officers fire away, killing Kenny and breaking the flagpole in half]
Manson
[peering out] Oh my God, they killed the little orange-coat kid!
Kyle
[peering out] You bastards! [the police don't react. Everyone now pours out of the house]
Chief Stevens:
[surprised] They're surrendering!
Cops
[run up and handcuff the pair] Okay, grab a hold of him. You're under arrest, buddy. [two of them beat on Kenny's corpse]
Blond Cop:
All right you, spread 'em! [puts the cuffs on Kenny]
Chief Stevens:
[helping in Manson's arrest] You're going back to prison to rot, Manson!
Manson
Good! I deserve to!
Chief Stevens:
What??
Manson
[hands behind his back] I can never make it up to the families that I destroyed, but at least I'll make an example for anyone else thinking that crime [softly] is an answer.
Chief Stevens:
Stop that. [the officer releases Manson]
Manson
You see, I get it now! I finally understand what the holidays are all about. Boys, don't you see? You can't let things get you down during the holidays, because being happy is what the holidays are all about!
Kyle
Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
Manson
I've been such a bastard all these years, and I finally understand. And it it it feels great! If I feel like- I feel like I'm in my own Christmas special. You see...
Holidays are that special time
When we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozy
Forget about being angry for a day [picks Elvin up]
Remember how it felt to be a child
Opening presents on Christmas mornin' 
That's the way that we should all feel now
So I say Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy
Holidays

Everyone Else:
Happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happy
Holidays
Manson
Happy Kwanzaa, too
From me to you
Happy Holidays, you guys.

Chief Stevens:
Happy Holidays, Bob.
Officer Bob:
Happy Holidays, Chief.
Chief Stevens:
Come on, Manson. You belong in jail. [finally cuffs him]
Manson
You're darn right I do.
Howard
[being cuffed] Well, I guess I'll be going, Mom and Dad. I hope you can forgive me.
Grandma
Oh, of course we forgive you, son. It was nice of you to pop in for the holidays.
Grandpa
Yes. Now, watch that ass in prison, son.
Howard
I always do. See ya, Eric. Thanks for all your help.
Cartman
See ya, Uncle Howard. [mad] Thanks for being such a great role model for me. [very softly] Piece of crap.
Stan
I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
Sharon
Oh, Stanley. Let's just forget the whole thing and have a nice holiday back home.
Stan
Really?
Randy
Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
Stan
Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?
Robert Pooner:
[wrap up] And so, Manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell. Everything is back to normal, and I guess the only thing left to say is, God bless us, everyone.
Nebraska State Penitentiary.
Manson
[in a cell with three other mates, reading from his latest book] "And I guess that's what I've learned. I'm sorry for what I did, but that doesn't make up for it. I deserve to be in jail. All I hope is that I don't make mankind lose faith in itself. Yes, there's murderers in the world. There's rapists and thieves. But those are the vast minority. The majority of mankind is made up of caring people, who try every day to do what they think is right. And that's the spirit of the season." What do you think, guys?
Inmate
It sucks, just like all your other books. [Manson puts his book next to the others and walks off: "AH, MILAN," "OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FOREST," "Are You There God? It's Me. Manson"]
Manson
Well, Guh Good night, you guys. Happy Holidays.
Inmate
Shut up! [Manson turns off the lights. Soon, noise is heard outside the cell]
Manson
What was that? [turns off the lights] What the?! [surprised to see the Cartmans and the boys inside the cell]
Cartmans/Boys:
Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson! 
[Grandma bears a cake. Manson melts, smiling. End credits soon roll]
"Hark," the herald angels sin,
"Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth, and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled"
[Manson joins them] Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
"Hark," the herald angels sing

Stan
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.

Gnomes
South Park Elementary. The class bell rings and the children are rowdy.
Mr. Garrison
[entering] Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad. [the class is now seated] The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again. [Stan raises his hand] Yes, Stanley?
Stan
That's okay with us.
Kyle
Yeah.
Clyde
Yeah, we don't care.
Cartman
Yeah, that's fine.
Mr. Garrison
No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board.
Class
Aawwww! [heads drop]
Mr. Garrison
[writes on the board] "Current Events in South Park". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on.
Class
Aawwww! [heads drop. Cartman is certainly vocal about it.]
Mr. Garrison
Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Token, you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek.
Tweek Tweak
[disheveled and really tweaked] AAAghah heheh.
Stan
[laments] Oh, not Tweek.
Kyle
We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
Mr. Garrison
There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
Tweek Tweak
I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!
Stan
Dude, we can't work with this kid.
Tweek
Yuh-ugh!
Mr. Garrison
That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought, "Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? [silence]
Stan
No.
Mr. Garrison
Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!
Tweek
Wagh!
South Park, downtown. Off to the right of Tom's Rhinoplasty is a coffee store: Tweek Bros. A businessman walks in with briefcase.
Richard Tweak
Hello there, customer.
Customer
Hello. How are you today?
Richard
Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee? [motions to the menu]
Customer
I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...
Richard
Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling.
Postum
That's right. How come you don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.
Richard
Oh, forget it, my store is not for sale.
Postum
My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer. [lifts the briefcase and opens it. It's empty, but he elaborates] This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?
Richard
Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me.
Postum
Well, all right. [closes the briefcase and lifts up two money bag] How about $500,000?
Richard
The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee. [moves to his left, towards a backdrop containing lovely rolling hills and a rainbow. A soothing acoustic tune comes up] Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more. [a cart of beans rolls up to him] And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America.
Postum
Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you.
Richard
[protesting] But that could put me out of business.
Postum
Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!
Postum leaves. Officer Barbrady enters.
Barbrady
[sees Postum leaving] Hello, Mr. Tweek.
Richard
Hi, Officer Barbrady.
Barbrady
Who was that?
Richard
Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you.
Officer Barbrady
The usual.
Richard pulls out a brown cat from behind the counter and slaps him with it.
Barbrady leaves as he closes the door.
Richard
Bye-bye.
South Park Elementary. The class is now in groups of five. Tweek is still wired.
Stan
Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
Tweek
[twitching and closing his right eye] AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn.
Stan
Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about.
Shots of Kyle, Kenny, then Cartman.
Cartman
How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.
Kyle
[angry] No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
Stan gets alarmed.
Tweek
Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!
Stan
Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
Tweek
The gnomes!
Stan
What?
Tweek
[gritting his teeth] We can do our report on the gnomes.
Stan
What gnomes?
Tweek
The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants.
Shots of Kyle, Stan, then Cartman looking at Tweek.
Cartman
Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.
Kyle
Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Stan
Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes.
Tweek
They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever.
Kyle
Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
Tweek
No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
The Tweak house that night. Richard Tweak and his wife are in the kitchen. They have three coffeemakers going on at once. Coffee mugs are everywhere.
Richard
They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money.
Mrs. Tweak
Some things are more important than money. [turns around] The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.
Richard
I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip.
Tweek and the boys enter.
Mrs. Tweak
Oh, hello, son. How was your day?
Tweek
UUuuUunh!
Mrs. Tweek
That's good. Who are your little friends?
Tweek
What do you mean?!
Kyle
We're his oral report buddies.
Stan
Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
Mrs. Tweak
Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later.
The boys each take a cup.
Kyle
Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
Mrs. Tweak
Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh.
Richard
[waxing prosaic] Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm.
Stan
'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
Richard
Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses?
Mrs. Tweak
Richard!
Richard
No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery.
Tweek
Mwaaah! Slavery?
Richard
Yes, slavery.
Stan
[to Tweek] Wow, that sucks, dude.
Richard
They really have my balls in a salad shooter.
Kyle
We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
Stan
Yeah.
Mrs. Tweak
Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes.
Tweek
Uunnnnhh!
Kyle
Come on, you guys! We better get to work!
Tweek and the boys leave the kitchen.
Richard
Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject.
Mrs. Tweak
Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds.
Richard
Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea.
Later that night, in Tweek's room, the boys sip their coffee.
Kyle
Man, this stuff is strong.
Stan
Kind of bitter.
Tweek
[in a corner of the room, scared] What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?
Kyle
[going to him] Don't worry about it.
Tweek
But we'll starve and die like dogs.
Cartman
Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?
Kenny
(Fuck you!)
Cartman
Heheh, you suck, Kenny.
Kyle
Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
Still later: 10:08p.m.. The boys are hyperactive.
Stan
Aooooo!
Kyle
Woohoo!
Kenny
(Let me try! Let me try!)
Stan
Yeess, this stuff rocks!
Kyle
Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
Stan
[running] Whoopee!
Kenny jumps high enough to knock down the bedside lamp. The shade goes to the floor. 10:09 p.m.
Cartman
[running around the rim of a throw rug like an Olympian] You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.
Kyle
Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
Tweek
I just have grounds.
Kyle
Killer!! [goes for it and eats it raw]
Cartman
[rushing up] Ey, let me have some grounds. [take some, swallows, and throws up]
Kyle
Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!
10:15 p.m. gives way to 3:26 a.m., which finds the boys sitting against the bed. Tweek is on it, and Cartman is passed out next to the toys, surrounded by pools of vomit. Kenny looks sleepy.
Kyle
Hogh, my stomach hurts.
Stan
Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
Kyle
[peeved] Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
Tweek
Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!
Stan
[cross] Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
Richard
[checking] How's the report going, boys?
Stan
Bad!
Richard
Oh, do you need some more coffee?
Boys
Eugh.
Cartman
No...more...coffee. Blech. [the vomit falls back on him and on the ground]
Richard
Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you.
All
[suddenly bright] You did?!
Richard
Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it.
Stan
[goes with Kyle to get it] No, we'll use it.
Richard
Alright. [Kyle takes it] And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right?
Tweek begins to hear some elfin music: "Time to go to work,"
Kyle
Sure. ["work all night"]
Richard
Now, when you give the report, [Tweek gasps and points] just make sure that you read this part first, okay? [the gnomes open the door and enter:
"Search for underpants, hey
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day"]
Tweek
There they are!
Richard
[A gnome goes for Tweek's bottom drawer, opens it, and takes out some underpants.
"Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day"]
And when you come up to do it a second time, really, really clear it up, I mean, um, really, really play the sympathy angle. They'll like that. They'll be calling you, and you'll get a passing grade for it.
Tweek
["Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey!"]
You guys, look! Look! You're missing it!
[the gnomes take off with two pairs of underpants:
"We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day!"]
Tweek
Arrgghh! They took them again!
Kyle
[to Richard] Thanks, dude.
Richard
My pleasure. G'night, boys.
Stan
Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!
Tweek
Why do they torture me like this?! Why can't they leave me alone?!
Kyle
Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
Tweek
They took my underpants again! Soon they'll want my blood! Blood! Euuggh!
South Park Elementary, the next day. The five-member South Park committee listens as Tweek's group speaks.
Kyle
[haltingly] "And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
Cartman
[steps forward] What will become of the endeavoring American family?"
Mr. Garrison
[off to one side, notices the lack of fluency] I don't think they wrote this, Mr. Hat.
Stan
Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
Tweek
[throbs] Uurrgh!
Kyle
And that's our report, I guess.
Mr. Garrison
Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't even--
Lady Member
Great job!
Mr. Garrison
[falling in] Yes, great job.
Lady Member
Boys, you have really opened our eyes. We didn't even know this was happening.
Cartman
Neither did we.
Lady Member
Well, Mr. Garrison, it looks like we were wrong about you. You really are teaching these kids something.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so.
Lady Member
Aw, I am really moved. I say we follow these boys's cause. Let's join them in the fight against corporate takeovers! [the members stand] Lead the way, boys!
Stan
Huh??
Tweek
Uunh, it's too much pressure!
Harbucks is going up.
Postum
[directing] Good! Good! Now, make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now.
Mrs. Tweak
My goodness. That's going to be a huge coffee house, honey.
Richard
Yes, it is. [places his hand over his groin] They really have my balls in a juice maker. [removes it as the boys stop by] Oh, hello, son, uh. How did your report go?
Tweek
Waagh!
Kyle
I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
Richard
Really?? Well, son, you might have just saved the family business. What do you have to say about that?
Tweek
I need coffee.
Richard
I know how you boys feel. [walks to a cup on a stump] Sometimes a hot cup of French Roast Amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day. That smooth aroma and mild taste is what make Tweek coffee... [picks up the cup and places his left foot on the stump, right hand on his hip] uh very special. Special, like an Arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew. A light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt-- [a chorus is heard].
Tweek
Dad!
Richard
What?
Tweek
The metaphors, man!
Richard
Oh, sorry. Here you go. [hands him the cup]
Kyle
Hey. Do you ever think maybe you shouldn't give your son coffee?
Mrs. Tweak
Liike, how do you mean?
Kyle
Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
Tweek
Agghh!
Mrs. Tweak
[holding a bag of Tweekers BLEND] Oh, that. He has ADD, attention deficit disorder. That's why he's so jittery all the time.
The town commitee arrives.
Lady Member
Mr. Tweek, we've only just heard.
Richard
Oh, hello committee members. What a surprise.
Lady Member
So, this is the corporate bulldozer trying to push you off the map. [Harbucks, with four tables on the roof]
Richard
Yes. How did you hear?
Lady Member 2
These boys did an excellent report for us this morning. They're so upset by this whole thing.
Kyle
My butt hurts.
Lady Member
Don't worry, Mr. Tweek. This committee is not going to let you be run out of business by these bastards! Do you hear that? You're not gonna get away with this, you whore!
Postum
Excuse me?!
Lady Member 2
Boys, we've talked it over, and we want you to take your case to the mayor!
Stan
Our case?
Tweek
Uuhhh, no way, man! That is way too much pressure!
Richard
[dismissing his son's apprehension] Oh, you'll do fine, son.
Lady Member 2
Come on, boys! Let's go!
Cartman
[pissed] Aw, man, this sucks!
The boys begin to walk with the town committee.
Tweek
[fretting] Aaarrrnnn!
City Hall. Mr. Garrison is present with the boys and the town committee.
Lady Member
...And we would have never even known that this was happening if not for these boys' excellent report.
Mayor
You're telling me that students from Mr. Garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
Lady Member
That's right.
Garrison is shown.
Mayor
Mr. Garrison, the guy with the puppet?
Lady Member
Yes!
Mayor
Well, I must say, Garrison, perhaps you're not as stupid and crazy as I always tell people you are.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-
Lady Member
Mayor, these boys want that Harbucks coffee shut down right now!
Male Member
Yeah!
Lady Member 2
Yeah!
Mayor
Well, I can't just shut them down, this is a free country.
Lady Member
But they're ruining our city!
Mayor
Look, the best I can do is create a proposition. We'll call it Prop. 10. The town can vote on it, and if it passes, we'll see what we can do.
Blond Member
Hooray!
The Other Members
Hooray!
Lady Member
[ecstatic] What do you say, boys? We're gonna pass a law!
Stan
Uh... Hooray.
Mayor
So I guess you wanna do some campaigning. [Tweek hears the gnomes coming] You can do commercials and things like that, and then we'll have a vote in the middle of town. And obviously, if more than 50% of the people even show up...
["Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey!
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day
Time to go to work, work all night" The gnomes go up to Johnson and pull his underpants out]
Tweek
Wagh!
Mayor
["Search for underpants, hey
We won't stop until we have..." A gnome tosses the underpants to two others, who carry it away over their heads. They all leave]
...and care enough to want Harbucks out, then, they're out. So, good luck to you. [the town committee leaves]
Tweek
Didn't you see them!?
Mayor
Alright, what's next.
Ted
Next is issue 37D, missing underpants. [hands the issue to her]
Johnson
Is it cold in here?
Mr. Garrison
Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you. [pretends Mr. Hat is saying something to him] Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.
Tweek
Jesus, man, Jesus! What are we gonna do, huh?!
South Park Town Hall Meeting.
Host
Live, it's the South Park Town Hall Meeting on Public Access. Tonight's topic: Prop. 10.
The audience claps.
Mediator
Should Harbucks be allowed to open a store in South Park? That's tonight's topic. On my left, five innocent, starry-eyed boys from Middle America. [shot of the boys] On my right, a big, fat, smelly corporate guy from New York.
Audience
Boo!
Postum
Hey, I'm not fat or smelly!
Mediator
All right, Mr. Douchebag.
Postum
Postum!
Mediator
Oh. Pardon me, Mr. Assface. Anyway, let's hear your side of the argument.
Audience
Boo!
Postum
My argument is simple. This country's founded on free enterprise. Harbucks is an organization that-
Audience
Hhssssssss!
Postem
An organization that prides itself on great coffee! We simply want tuh-- Oh, to hell with you!
Mediator
[the hissing stops] Okay, ucka-fay. Now for the other side of the argument we turn to our young, handsome lads. [the boys stay silent] Boys, your thoughts. [Tweek twitches] Come on, boys, don't be shy. What's your principal argument?
Nothing. A stern Mr. Garrison crosses his arms.
Kyle
Uh...
Stan
Uh...
Cartman
This guy sucks ass!
Audience
Yeah! Yeah! Woo!
Mediator
Great argument! You win, boys!
Postum
What?!
Mr. Garrison
[softly, relieved] That was close, Mr. Hat.
The boys' first commercial, beginning with an American flag waving, filling the screen.
Voice-over
What is the future of America? Is it the money we make? [a $1 bill] The quests we conquer? [the Moon shot] No, it's children. [head shots of Tweek and the boys] So what do children have to say about Prop. 10?
Kyle
[screen right to screen left] I don't like big corporations.
Stan
[rising from the bottom] I like small businesses.
Cartman
[screen left to screen right] I believe in the family-owned enterprise.
Kenny
[dropping from the top] (In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)
Tweek
[screen right to screen left] Aarrgghh!
Voice-over
It's time to stop large corporations. Prop. 10 is about children. Vote Yes on Prop. 10, or else, you hate children. You don't hate... children... do you? Remember, keep American business small, or else. [the kids' heads combust and only their skulls are left in flames, with charred caps.] Paid for by Citizens for a Fair and Equal way to get Harbucks Coffee kicked out of town forever.
The TV clicks off, and everyone is in the studio.
Lady Member
Well, what do you think?
Richard
Wow, it it's great!
Lady Member
[confidently] Yes, it is. We'll put it on the air immediately.
Richard
What do you think, hon? [she crosses her arms and moves away him. He follows] Hon? What's the matter?
Mrs. Tweak turns to him.
Mrs. Tweak
I have a big problem with this.
Richard
What do you mean?
Mrs. Tweak
We are just using those boys for our benefit. They have no idea what they're saying.
Richard
But, kids are great to get people on our side.
Mrs. Tweak
You don't just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs. I won't be a part of this anymore. [walks out the door]
Richard
Honey, all's fair in love and war. [softly] And coffee. Hon? Hu-hon?
Harbucks' grand opening. Protesters arrive.
Lady Protester
Take your corporate coffee and go back to New York City!
Crowd
Yeah!!
Blonde Protester
It's people like you who are ruining Main Street, USA!
Postum looks out through the window.
Crowd
That's right! Yeah!
Lady Protester
How many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee, huh?!
Crowd
[after a pause] Yeah!!
Postum
[inside] Damn, these people aren't buying any coffee! I'll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd.
Later. The crowd now marches in front of Harbucks. To the right, Harbucks' mascot, wearing a fez, holds a tray of coffee cups topped with whipped cream before a boy.
Postum
[the man in the camel] Hey, kids. I'm Camel Joe and I love a fresh cup of coffee. It's yum diddly-icious, and it makes you feel super! [a small boy is listening] I have a surprise for you: the new Kiddicino from Harbucks; more sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte.
The kid reaches for one.
Kid's Mom
[rushing up] No Billy, no coffee for you. [to Camel Joe] You should be ashamed of yourself, using cartoons to push caffeine on children!
Postum
[rips off the helmet] Why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from, lady?!
Richard
[intervening] Uh, Mr. Postum, I'm afraid you've got a lot to learn about making coffee.
Postum
Oh, and you don't? Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea!
Richard
Uh, I'm sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you're gonna be thrown out of town.
Postum
What?!
Richard
At five o'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... Tweek's coffee. [brings out a bag of Tweekers BLEND, then hugs it] Like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on Tweek's coffee to start your day. [turns and walks away]
Mayor
[arriving with her aides] Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we'll set up ballot booths... here. [between the two coffee shops] All right, men, we'll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we'll get a band everyone likes, like uhhhh, like...
Johnson
Toto.
Mayor
Like Toto. And then the Harbucks guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak, and then the town votes.
Mr. Garrison
[standing with the boys in front of Tweek Bros.] Uh, boys, you better get your asses to work.
Cartman
What now?
Mr. Garrison
They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes.
Kyle
Oh, God, when is this gonna end?
Stan
Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!
Tweek
Jesus, dude! I'm to blame for all this! I'm to blame for everything!
Tweek's house that night, Tweek's room. Tweek is on the floor and the others are on his bed.
Kyle
So what are we gonna say?
Cartman
Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?
Stan
'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
Kyle
Does anybody know anything about corporations? [the gnomes return, and Tweek gasps. The door opens and the gnomes enter, singing their theme:
"Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey"]
Tweek
["We won't stop"] Waagh!
Cartman
["until we have underpants"] I think my mom is a corporation.
Stan
["Yum tum yummy tum day!"] Yeah, that makes sense.
Tweek
You guys! Sshhhh! ["Time to go to work"]
Kyle
Well, how about we just say, "corporates should be stopped"?
["work all night
Search for underpants, hey"]
Stan
How do we stretch that into five minutes?
Tweek
They're taking my underpants!
["We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day"]
Kyle
[looking down] Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here! ["Time to go to work"]
Tweek
[points at the gnomes] Aaaggghhh! ["work all night
Search for underpants, hey"
They open the bottom drawer and go for the underpants]
Stan
What the hell? ["We won't stop"]
Cartman
["until we have underpants"] Well, I'll be damned.
Tweek
["Yum tum yummy tum day!"] That's my last pair of underpants!
["Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey..." The gnomes go for the door, and the boys hop off the bed to follow. One gnome stops and faces the boys]
Kyle
Sshh, don't scare him.
Stan
Hey there, little guy.
Cartman
Bad! [whacks the gnome with a stick]
Kyle
Cartman!
Cartman
What?!
Kyle
Why do you always have to hit stuff with a stick?!
Cartman
Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him. [whacks him again]
Gnome
Is that all you've got, pussy?
Cartman
What?! [advances]
Stan
Hey, he talks!
Cartman
Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!
Gnome
You're a pussy, pussy!
Cartman
Ey!
Stan
Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
Kyle
Yeah, look what you're doing to this poor kid.
Tweek
Waggh.
Gnome
Stealing underpants big business.
Stan
Business? Wait, do you know anything about business?
Gnome
Sure, that's what gnomes do.
Kyle
Show us.
Gnome
O-kay. Follow me. [goes for the door]
Cartman
[muttering] Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome.
The woods. The gnome leads them on to his cave.
Gnome
Not much longer now.
Cartman
Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?
Gnome
No, pussy, I'm taking you to my village.
Cartman
Oh, your pussy village?
Stan
Cartman, will you just shut up and let him show us?
Gnome
[reaches a tree, knocks on its base and a door opens] Follow me.
Cartman
[the boys look at him] I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
Starbucks, early morn. Workers put on the finishing touches to the coffee store.
Postum
Well, it looks like Harbucks will never make it in this town. [turns around] All right, boys, that's it. Pack it up, we're movin' out of town.
Worker 1
Aw, but we just finished.
Postum
I know, but these folks obviously don't want us here.
Worker 2
But what will become of us?
Postum
Oh, quit being so melodramatic, Sanchez. Jesus Christ!
Underground. The boys are still following the gnome.
Stan
Damn, dude, this place is huge!
Before them is a pile of underpants as tall as a man. Some of them are colored.
Kyle
Yeah. It's almost as big as Cartman's ass.
Cartman
[exhales] No it isn't, you guys!
Gnome
This is where all our work is done.
Cartman
So what are you gonna do with all these underpants that you steal?
Gnome
Collecting underpants is just phase 1. Phase 1: collect underpants.
Kyle
Sooo, what's phase 2?
Gnome
[has no response. Looks around, then calls out to the other gnomes on the underpants mound] Hey, what's phase 2?
Gnome 2
Phase 1: we collect underpants.
Gnome
Yeah yeah yeah, but, what about phase 2?
Gnome 2
[says nothing, then] Well, phase 3 is profit. Get it?
Stan
I don't get it.
Gnome 2
[walks up to a large chart] You see,
Phase 1: collect underpants. Phase 2: ... Phase 3: Profit.
Cartman
Oh, I get it.
Stan
No you don't, fatass!
Kyle
Do you guys know anything about corporations?
Gnome
You bet we do!
Gnome 2
Us gnomes are geniuses at corporations.
Gnomes
[three of them move a cart up a track]
Time to go to work, work all night
Se--
Center Gnome
[the cart falls off the track and on down] Jesus Christ, look out!
The cart lands on Kenny.
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
Kyle
You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
Gnome
Holy shit! We've killed your friend!
Stan
Yeahyeahyeah. Look. We've gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or we're screwed.
Gnome 2
Christ, we squished him like a bug!
Stan
Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
Gnome
Well, we can explain that to you easily.
Gnome 2
Yes, for a price.
Kyle
What?
Gnome
You know.
Stan
Underpants?
Gnomes
Underpants!
Harbucks, daytime. Prop. 10 supporters are out in force and Toto is performing.
Lady Member
[taking the stage] Toto, ladies and gentlemen!
The band leaves.
Prop. 10 Supporter
Yeah, Toto! Whoo, Toto! Woo!
Lady Member
All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children.
Stan
Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
Supporter
Underpants gnomes?
Kyle
Big corporations are good!
Supporter
What?
Supporter 2
What's this?
Supporter 3
Good? [the Lady Member is cross]
Kyle
Because without big corporations we wouldn't have things like cars and computers and canned soup.
Stan
Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay!
The crowd is stunned.
Townsman
Ogh.
Lady Member
That's not what you said last time.
Kyle
Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time.
Gasps from the crowd.
Mr. Garrison
You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!!
Officer Barbrady and another man haul him off. Mrs. Tweek claps for the boys and goes onstage.
Mrs. Tweak
These boys are absolutely right. We've been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it's wrong. We're as low and despicable as Rob Reiner. You keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you ever even bother to taste Harbucks coffee? [shot of the town committee. The crowd blinks] Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don't you think you should at least try it?
The crowd parts as Postum exits Harbucks with a tray of his coffee, then closes in to get the coffee. Some people taste it.
Townsman
Hey, this is pretty damn good.
Townsman 2
Yeah, it doesn't have that bland, raw, sewage taste that Tweek's coffee has.
Richard
[comes over for a taste] Hey. Hey, that is good.
Postum
It's a French roast.
Richard
It's subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be.
Postum
Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I'm sure it will make a lot of money.
Richard
Thank you, Mr. Postum, but I think we'll be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery.
Tweek
Aggghhh!
Richard
Just kidding, son.
Everyone laughs. The gnomes come and remove the pants from a townsman behind Tweek's right shoulder.
Cartman
I love you guys. [more laughter]
'[End of Gnomes. And what do the gnomes sing?
Time to go to work, work all night
Search for underpants, hey!
We won't stop until we have underpants
Yum tum yummy tum day!]'

End of Gnomes

Prehistoric Ice Man
Cartman's house. A television is heard. The screen shows an Australian crocodile hunter narrating his adventures as a woman pilots his boat down a river.
Aussie
As we steer our boat down [the boys are on the sofa looking at TV], looking for these dangerous predators... Boy, there's a king croc right here. [it slips into the water] He must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long at least. [it looks up at him] This croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off.
Kenny
(Oh, no!) [tightens his hood up]
Aussie
I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole.
Stan
Holy crap. dude!
Aussie
If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole. [jumps in and grabs the crocodile] Oh, boy, it's pissed off now.
Kyle
Go, dude, go! [excited, the boys jump on the sofa]
Aussie
I'm gonna jam my thumb it its butthole now! This should really piss it off! [reaches down with his left thumb to do it. The croc jumps up in pain and drops] Oh, yeah, that pissed it off, all right! [the boys cheer] I've gotta be careful!
Stan
This guy rules!
Kenny
(He actually killed it!)
Cartman
I told you guys.
Aussie
[with left arm now bandaged and in a sling] Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching.
Kyle
[to Stan] Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
Stan
Yeah!
The four of them hop to the floor and walk out the front door.
The woods. Cartman leads the boys up a hill. All are armed with water guns.
Cartman
[with Aussie accent] There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!
Kyle
That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
Cartman
[advancing towards Kyle] Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!
Kyle
Get away from me, Cartman! [backs away]
Cartman
Come 'ere, crocky.
Kyle
[trips over a rock and tumbles down the slope] AAAAAAAAAA!
The boys follow him to a hole.
Stan
Dude!
Kyle
[from the bottom of a dark shaft. His figure disappears] HELP! [thud]
Stan
Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!
Kenny
(You bastard!)
Cartman
Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. [backs up]
Stan
Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
Cartman
Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! [turns around and walks off]
Kyle
You guuuys!
Stan
[to Cartman] Hey, he's still alive. [looks down and calls] Kyle, you okay? [Cartman returns and looks down]
Kyle
I think so. Is Cartman up there?
Cartman
I'm right here, Kyle.
Kyle
Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
Cartman
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!
Stan
Can you climb back up, dude?
Kyle
I don't think so.
Stan
Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
Cartman
[moves away] Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.
Inside a cave at the bottom of the shaft, Kyle awaits his rescue. Stan descends, spinning slowly as Cartman huffs outside.
Stan
Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach! [his vomit goes everywhere] Bluchluchluchluch.
Kyle
Sick, dude! [wipes some off his cap]
Stan
Sorry. [Cartman slips a bit] What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! [drops to the cave ground and stands up]
Cartman
Screw you, hippie!
Kyle
Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here.
Stan
All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?
He walks to an ice pillar nearby. Kyle follows. Stan rubs some frost away from the pillar, revealing a frozen man.
Both
AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Kyle
Dude, it's a dude!
Stan takes a closer look.
Stan
He's like, some frozen guy.
Cartman
Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!
Stan
Shut up, Cartman! [to Kyle] Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
Kyle
Wow. Cool.
Stan
[to Cartman and Kenny] You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
Cartman
Really? [to Kenny] Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.
Stan
[to Kyle] Help me chip some of the ice away.
Cartman
Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about "Greased Lightning." [no response] You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-
Stan and Kyle
[frustrated by Cartman's talkativeness] CARTMAN, WILL YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND GET SOME MORE ROPE?!
Cartman
Aww, screw you guys anyway!
Stan
Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
Kyle
Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
Both
Hooray!
Cartman
For what?
On the road towards town. Cartman pulls the frozen man on a sled while the other three push from behind.
Stan
Where shall we bring it?
Kyle
I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
Stan
I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
Kyle
No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
Stan
[stops] Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? [Cartman pulls, but isn't going anywhere]
Kyle
It's my name, and I found him.
Stan
You didn't find him, I found him.
Kyle
What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
Stan
You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
Kyle
Kenny, who found the ice man?
Kenny
(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve.)
Cartman
I think we're almost there, you guys.
City Hall front lawn. The mayor is at the podium and a crowd of townspeople is watching.
Mayor McDaniels
Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say "yippee."
Some people
Yippee.
Tardy Man
Wait, what was that? I missed the question. Yippee! [raises both hands]
Mayor McDaniels
All those opposed, say "nay."
Other people
Nay.
Tardy Man
Screw you! [punches the guy to his right]
Man
Ey! Screw you! [hits the tardy man, and everyone starts fighting. The boys show up with the ice man]
Stan
Huh, excuse me?
Mayor McDaniels
Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. [quite vigorously, too]
Kyle
But we found a frozen ice man from the past! [all stop]
Stan
I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Kyle
No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
Mayor McDaniels
What the hell is going on here?
Kyle
We came for our reward.
Cartman
Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.
Mayor McDaniels
[annoyed] Reward? What reward?
Dr. Mephesto
[arriving] Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link [close-up] in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time.
Mayor
Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.
Dr. Mephesto
Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him.
Stan
Really.
Kyle
Sweet. How about Steve?
Dr. Mephesto
Steve it is.
Stan
Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
Dr. Mephesto
Come on, Steve. We've got work to do. [pushes "Steve" away with Kevin. Stan is not happy at Kyle's sleight of word] Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available.
The South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. Inside, Dr. Mephesto and Kevin use blow dryers on the ice man. Quite an advanced method.
Dr. Mephesto
This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era. [turns off the blow dryer and picks up a flashlight to inspect the man] Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996! [Kevin expresses shock] This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away.
The lab door flies open and cameras flash all around. Officer Barbrady tries to hold the press back by barring entrance through the door.
Officer Barbrady
Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here.
Reporter
What about the prehistoric ice man?
Officer Barbrady
Oh, yeah. There is that. [lowers his arms, and the press rushes in.]
Reporter
Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell us what's going on?
Dr. Mephesto
Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do. [the press mills around, taking pictures] But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months! [some reporters gasp] Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes.
News 4 Special Report. The caption has a silhouette of a caveman stamped with a question mark.
Reporter
Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:
Kyle
[Stan and Kenny in the background] Well, I fell down this ice cavern, [Stan interrupts him with "la"s] and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- [Kenny looks at Stan, and Kyle glances back]
Reporter
The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street.
The genetic engineering ranch.
Dr. Mephesto
That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy.
"Steve"
[stirs] Uuuurrr.
Dr. Mephesto
Ugh? What's this?
"Steve"
[stirs more] Mmmmm.
Mayor McDaniels
Holy crap! He's alive??
Dr. Mephesto
That's impossible! [to Kevin] Do an EKG on him!
Kevin hits "Steve" on the head with the hammer.
"Steve"
Uugh! [Raises his right arm to his head to soothe the pain]
Dr. Mephesto
My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!
Mayor McDaniels
[alarmed] Well, quick, do something!
Dr. Mephesto
No no, we've got to think this through. [takes the mayor aside] Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!
Mayor McDaniels
Well, you just can't let him die.
Dr. Mephesto
Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.
"Steve"
Uh, ughn.
Dr. Mephesto
[moves towards him] Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak!
"Steve"
[eyes open] Where... where am I?
Reporter 1
What?
Reporter 2
What's he saying?
Reporter 3
Is that English?
Dr. Mephesto
What? You're, you're hungry?
"Steve"
Where am I?
Dr. Mephesto
You're, you're hungry?
"Steve"
What's goin' on?
Dr. Mephesto
Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to.
"Steve"
Huh?
Dr. Mephesto
Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers. [Kevin hits "Steve" a couple more times, and "Steve" soothes his head again] If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a child.
The boys walk along the curb on their was home.
Stan
Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
Kyle
Gorak's a gay name.
Stan
No, it isn't!
Kyle
Why are you being such a dick?
Stan
I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!
Kyle
Nuh-uh!
Officer Barbrady
[rushing up] Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man.
Kyle
I'll go.
Stan
No, I'll go! I found him!
Cartman
Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!
Officer Barbrady
All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes. [thumbs come out] My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out? [Lands on Kenny]
Kenny
(Blue.)
Officer Barbrady
B L O O uh oh-O spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown. [The boys look confused]
The genetic engineering ranch. "Steve" is now sitting up.
Dr. Mephesto
Steve. You-
"Steve"
Where am I?
Dr. Mephesto
Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve. [the door opens, and the boys rush in] Oh good, you're here.
Stan
Oh my God, they revived Gorak.
Kyle
You bastards!
Dr. Mephesto
Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying.
He takes Stan to Steve.
Stan
Uh, hi.
"Steve"
Hi.
Dr. Mephesto
[rushing] What'd he say?
Stan
He said, "hi."
Dr. Mephesto
Very interesting.
"Steve"
Where am I?
Dr. Mephesto
What??
Stan
He wants to know where he is.
Dr. Mephesto
Tell him, tell him he's... home.
Stan
You're... home.
"Steve" scratches his head.
Dr. Mephesto
In the year 1999.
"Steve"
It's 1999??
Dr. Mephesto
He's been frozen for the last 32 months.
Stan
Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
Dr. Mephesto
And we found you-
"Steve"
What? Thirty-two months?!
Dr. Mephesto
All right, all right, all-
"Steve"
Aaaa! [throws over a tray]
Dr. Mephesto
All right, all right, calm down.
"Steve"
[panics] AAAAAAA!
Dr. Mephesto
I think that's enough for today. [sedates him]
"Steve"
Whoa, oh.
Kyle
Good job, dude! You freaked him out!
Stan
Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him.
They face each other. Cartman looks on, between them.
Kyle
Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
Cartman
Sweet.
Stan
Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
Cartman
Killer.
Kyle
Fine! [turns and walks away]
Stan
Fine! [turns and walks away]
Cartman
Fine.
The genetic engineering ranch. A car is stationed outside. A finger presses the butt-shaped doorbell.
Agent
[one of three] Are you Alphonse Mephesto?
Dr. Mephesto
The same.
Agent
We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996.
Dr. Mephesto
That's right.
Agent
We would like to... [notices Kevin and stares] we would like to offer our services in your experiments.
Dr. Mephesto
Oh? Where are you gents from?
Agent 2
We are from the University, of... America.
Dr. Mephesto
Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in. [opens the door and makes way for them] He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in, [as he leads them, familiar animals can be seen in display cages: four-assed monkey, four-assed mongoose, four-assed ostrich] but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat.
Agent
Habitat?
Dr. Mephesto
[they turn the corner into a darkened area] Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented.
He turns on the light, and Ace of Base's "All That She Wants" blares from a stereo.
Agent
Amazing. He looks so much like us.
"Steve" sits on a "Hunchback of Notre Dame" bed, with posters of "Fargo" and "Independence Day" on the back wall.
Dr. Mephesto
Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing:
He holds up evolution of man drawing with "Steve" right before the modern man.
Agent
Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative.
Dr. Mephesto
How would we do that?
Agent
It's easy.
Dr. Mephesto has opened up his ranch to the public. Viewers move down a moving sidewalk looking at the habitat and listening to Ace of Base's "The Sign". One viewer snaps a picture. Mephesto stands at a podium.
Dr. Mephesto
As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers.
The boys appear on the sidewalk.
Stan
He doesn't look very happy in there.
Kyle
No, he sure doesn't.
Stan
I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
Kyle
Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
Cartman
Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.
Dr. Mephesto
Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him. ["Steve" throws the mouse away, then overturns the computer in a fit of rage. The viewers are alarmed as he moves towards the window] It's okay, he can't hurt you. [they chuckle in relief] It's one-way glass: he can't even see us. ["Steve" goes to the back wall] And now the ice man watches television.
Click. The Aussie hunter is on TV. A grizzly bear is man-handling him.
Aussie
This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.
Dr. Mephesto
[to the Agents] Wait. This could be dangerous.
Agent
How so?
Dr. Mepehsto
He's changing the channel. Something on the television could frighten and confuse him.
Sports Reporter
And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl!
"Steve"
What?!! Rrrowrrr!
He throws the TV off the cabinet and the crowd recoils. He senses the crowd, as he turns towards the glass and growls.
Stan
[approaches with Kyle and Cartman] You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
Kyle
He's my creature!
Dr. Mephesto
He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him.
Stan
Let him out, dude. He's scared.
Agent
He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?
Kyle
But it isn't right!
Agent 2
Little boy, sometimes, what's right isn't as important as what's profitable.
Stan turns and walks to the window. He looks at "Steve" in empathy. More people come by to look at the ice man.
Kenny
[notices the end of the sidewalk] (Uh oh. Ow!)
He slips down between the sidewalk and the landing, and is flattened to death. His remains reappear at the other end.
Stan
[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! [looks at Kyle]
Kyle
What?! I'm not talking to you! [walks away]
Later that night.
Stan
[a voice in the night] Gorak! [he rushes to the habitat, then heads to the access door] Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
"Steve"
Oh hi. What are you doing here? Viewing hours are 10 to 6.
Stan
I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
"Steve"
Wow. That's really nice of you, kid. Thanks!
A door opens off-screen, and Stan turns to see who it is. Kyle appears.
Stan
What are you doing here?
Kyle
[reaches the access door] I'm here to bust out Steve.
Stan
What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
Kyle
His name is Steve!
Stan
His name is Gorak!
"Steve"
My name is Larry.
Kyle
Steve!
Stan
Gorak!
Kyle
Steve!
Stan
What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
Kyle
Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man.
Stan
[looks up at Larry, who looks back] No he doesn't!!
Kyle
Does so!
Larry
Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?
Stan
I found him, I'm rescuing him!
Kyle just opens the door.
Larry
[to Kyle] Thanks. [leaves]
Stan
You're a dick!
Kyle
You're a dick!
Stan
You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!
Kyle
You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
Stan
Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!
Kyle
Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?
Stan
[hushed] Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
Kyle
[hushed] Oh yeah. [loudly] Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! [walks away]
Stan
I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean. [turns his head aside] Wait. [walks off in the opposite direction]
The town, next day. Larry walks around and comes across "TELE'S," which shows a large-screen TV flanked by towers three TV's tall on each side. Marilyn Manson is on screen.
Marilyn Manson
I just smelled your britches and they're stinky
Stinky Britches
Stinky Britches

Larry
Arrrggh!
He crashes through the window, takes the large-screen TV and smashes it to the ground, then walks away.
The genetic engineering ranch.
Dr. Mephesto
He's gone! The ice man has broken out!
Agent
No, that's impossible! How could he have?
Dr. Mephesto
He must have used this... door.
A door to the outside is open next to him.
Agent
Damn it, Damn it!
Dr. Mephesto
We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!
Agent
Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war-
Agent 2
Sshhhh!
Agent
Right.
Mephesto
What?
Agent 2
What?
Agent
Nothing.
Dr. Mephesto
No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?
Agent
[shrilly] Butlutlutlutlup!
Mephesto just stares at him.
Agent 2
Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature have gone?
Dr. Mephesto
I have no idea!
Agent
We'll never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance.
Larry knocks at a door at 1299 Waterston St. A woman opens the door.
Woman
Can I help you?
Larry
Leslie. It's me, Larry. [she stares back, blankly] Your husband?
Leslie
Husband? You're not my husband.
Larry
Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?
Woman
I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass.
Larry
That was me!
Leslie
[a bit stunned] Oh.
Big Man
[appears behind her] Who is it, lover?
Leslie
It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about.
Big Man
Ooooo. [he and Larry check each other out] Well, sir, let me shake your hand. I'm proud to meet the man whose wife I'm currently sticking it to every night. [walks away]
Larry
So you... remarried.
Leslie
Yes, Lorry.
Larry
Larry!
Leslie
Uh, larry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on.
Larry
Didn't anybody send out a search party?
Leslie
We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace.
Larry
Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused.
Leslie
Leslie, I'm with Buck now. [must be the big dude shown earlier]
Larry
You're Leslie.
Leslie
Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together. [they appear] Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry.
Larry
I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone. [walks away. She closes the door, and he stops] Eight and thirteen? [wrong family?]
Stan's house. He and Cartman are out in the backyard. Cartman is dressed as an outback hunter.
Cartman
Well, I don't see any crocs out here.
Stan
Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
Cartman
[walks over to a cat nearby] Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got! [the cat leaps up and scratches his face] Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch!
He feels the two scratches on his left cheek.
Stan
You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
Cartman
You son of a bitch cat!
Stan
[walks to Larry, bathing in a tub out in the open with the garden hose, and looks at him for a while] What are you doing, Gorak!
Larry
[turns to see him] I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again.
Stan
Wow, that sucks, dude.
Larry
Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over.
Kyle
[rushing in with a travel guide] Steve, wait!
Stan
What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
Kyle
I've got something to show Steve, dick!
Stan
Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
Kyle
Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
Larry
What is that? [drops the hose]
Kyle
It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see? [opens the guide to show Des Moines's assets] Everybody looks like you do. [flips the page] Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you.
He hands him the guide to look over.
Sorry
[closes it with affection] Home.
Kyle
Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
Stan
Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
Kyle
No you don't, butthole!
A helicopter is heard over the neighborhood, and Larry sees it. Dogs begin barking.
Larry
They're coming for me!
Stan
Come on! [the three run away]
Cartman
Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face.
Mephesto and his agents arrive.
Dr. Mephesto
Was the ice man here?
Cartman
He might have been, by crikey.
Agent
We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?
Aussie
[!] Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!
Cartman
Wow! Kick ass!
South Park Train Station. People are waiting to depart, and a train is pulling in.
Stan
We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
Clerk
Des Moines? What the hell for?
Kyle
We have to get our friend, Steve-
Stan
My friend, Gorak!
Kyle
-to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt away.
Stan
No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!
Kyle
Frosty, Steve, whatever.
Clerk
Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat.
He sets to writing the ticket. The boys soon look at the clock on the wall.
Stan
Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock.
Kyle
Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
Larry
Okay, boys. Thanks.
The boys walk off, then stop. Stan turns around.
Kyle
Okay. First one to die, loses.
Stan
'K.
Kyle
Okay. [neither one moves]
Stan
O-okay.
Kyle
So, here we go. [puts up his fists]
Stan
'K [puts up his fists]
Kyle
Go. [they lock fists and start fighting]
The woods. The Aussie leads Mephesto, Agents, Barbrady, and other cops, in a hunt. He runs across a set of tracks.
Aussie
Wait a second. [bends down, picks up some snow and sniffs at it. Cartman imitates] I think he came through here recently.
Cartman
Yeah, I think the same thing.
Agent
Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab.
Dr. Mephesto
He can't function out here in our time!
Aussie
[rising] Calm down, calm down.
Cartman
Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.
Aussie
Wait! Look!
Dr. Mephesto
Is it him?
Aussie
No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake. [curled up on a stump, it hisses] This is the most poisonous snake in this entire region. [quietly] Now, what I'm gonna do, is carefully sneak up on him, and jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey! [leaps on the snake] Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now! [his thumb sticks high in the air, then drops] Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right!
Dr. Mephesto
Does he always do this?
Agent
[now cross, in a low voice] Yeah.
Cartman
I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
The train station. Stan and Kyle are still fighting.
Stan
[punched by Kyle] Ow!
Kyle
[punched in return] Ow! [he throws Stan down]
Stan
Watch my coat, dude.
Kyle
Oh.
Larry
[walks up] I got my ticket.
Stan
Huh? [both look at Larry]
Larry
I have to go to Platform B.
Kyle
[blinks, then] Oh. Okay, it's over this way.
He leads him there with Stan. Larry takes a seat on a bench, and Stan and Kyle resume fighting.
Aussie
[shows up at the ticket booth with the hunting party] The trail ends here.
Agent
The train station? Then he's trying to go somewhere.
Dr. Mephesto
[to the clerk] Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose?
Clerk
What the hell are you talking about?
Dr. Mephesto
An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!
Platform B. Larry has gotten on the train, and the boys see him off. They get back to fighting.
Larry
Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys.
Stan
[panting] No problem, Gorak.
Kyle
Later.
Larry
You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about.
Stan
Yup.
Kyle
Uh huh.
Larry
After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world!
Stan
[panting] Right on.
Kyle
Cool.
Larry
Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends!
The train pulls away. The boys watch it leave, then resume fighting.
Dr. Mephesto
[rushing up] Where is he? Where is Steve?!
Kyle and Stan butt heads and remain eye-to-eye.
Stan
His... name... is... Gorak!
Kyle
His name... is Steve!
Agent
The train! [it passes the water tower]
Dr. Mephesto
We've got to stop it!
Aussie
No worries. [cocks his rifle and goes after Larry]
Agent
Let's get him! [the party gives chase]
Stan and Kyle
No! [they stay behind, for a moment]
The hunting party is now on the tracks chasing the train.
Agent
We've gotta stop that train!
Aussie
Come back here, you! [jumps onto the caboose landing]
Kyle
Steve! Steve, look out!
Stan
They're after you!
Larry looks out his window.
Aussie
Oh, he's a wily one!
He looks over the railing and sees Larry, then shows him his thumb and smiles.
Larry
Oh, poo!
Kyle
Steve, look out!
Mephesto and the Agents have reached the engine.
Aussie
[meeting Larry in his car] Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. As well as he should be, as I will now jam my thumb up his butthole.
Larry
Huh? [the Aussie pounces on him] Whah?!
Agent
[reaches for the conductor's door] Stop the train!
Conductor
Hey, who are you?
Agent
I said, stop that train!
Conductor
Yes, hello. I see you.
Cartman
They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
Atop the train, Larry and the Aussie wrestle.
Larry
[pins the Aussie] I've got you pinned. I win.
Aussie
[reverses the pin] Now I've got you pinned. I win!
On the tracks, Stan and Kyle try to keep up.
Conductor
[ducking gunshots from the Agent] Whoa!
Agent
[a helicopter comes into view and descends] Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here! [into a communicator] Go get him, boys! [the pilot acknowledges] Cut him off!
Larry
[pinned on his stomach, his butt in the air] Nooo!
Aussie
Now for the coup de gras. I'll just... get my... thumb up... here.
Larry
[lets out a long, painful] Oohh!
The helicopter lands in front of the train, but the train rolls on.
Pilot
Aah, the train's not stopping. [it gets closer...] It's not stopping! [...and closer...] AAAAAAAA!
Impact, but the train's the one that gets ruined.
Aussie
[thrown towards the helicopter] Holy bum-!
The blades chop him up.
Stan
[catching up] Where's Gorak??
Pilot
[steps off the chopper] Wow, that is the God-damnedest thing I've ever seen.
Agent
Where's the ice man?!
Dr. Mephesto
He has to be around here somewhere.
Larry comes up behind the pilot and takes off in the helicopter.
Kyle
I can't believe he's gone.
Stan
[turns around] Wait, look! The helicopter!
They reach Mephesto and company.
Kyle
Hey!
Stan
He's alive!
Larry
[on the bullhorn] Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines!
Dr. Mephesto
No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!
Larry
I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends! [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya!
He flies off towards the mountains.
Agent
[leaving with his colleagues] Damn! Well, so much for our plan to use the ice man to take over Sweden.
Dr. Mephesto
[following] What?!
Agent
What? Nothing!
Stan
Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
Kyle
No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him.
Cartman
[still hunting] Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha.
Stan
[walks off with Kyle] Could we be best friends again? [Cartman stops] I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
Kyle
Me too. He sucks.
Cartman
Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my- [turns left and goes Aussie] Aha! There's a king croc right there! [a cow grazing on a tiny patch of grass. Cartman sneaks up] And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-
Cow
Moo!
The cow sits on Cartman, forcing his gun to the ground, then stands up with Cartman stuck up its ass.
Cartman
Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
[End of Prehistoric Ice Man. "Stinky Britches" once again:
Stinkin' britches, you've got stinky britches
Stinkin' britches, you've got stinky britches
You've got stinky britches]

End of Prehistoric Ice Man

Rainforest Shmainforest
South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. A group of visiting kids in yellow G.G.W.K. shirts stands next to Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people [she walks to the group and smiles] for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame [she frowns], but please, give her your full attention. [to her] Go ahead.
Choir Teacher
Uh. Thank you, Mr. Garrison. [cheerfully] How are we all doing today?! [the kids' eyes wander] I can't hear you! I said, How are we all doing?! [Cartman farts]
Mr. Garrison
[angrily] Eric Cartman, you say ‘’excuse me”!
Cartman
Okay.
Mr. Garrison
[to the choir teacher] Go ahead.
Choir Teacher
Children, we are a national choir called, "Getting Gay With Kids!" We're gonna do a big tour down in Central America to help save the rainforest, and you can be a part of it!
Kenny
That sounds fucking screwed. [the others laugh]
Mr. Garrison
Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!! [to the choir teacher] Go ahead.
Choir Teacher
You see, we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir [Pip yawns and Bill notices. Clyde nods off] where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest.
Choir Boy
[steps forward] Did you know over 10,000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year?
Choir Girl
[steps forward] That's right. And over 30% of the world's oxygen [Kenny sees her and begins to swoon] is made in the rainforest. [smiles back at him. Kenny's in love - ahem, distracted. The camera stays on him]
Choir Teacher
So, who wants to join the fun??
Cartman
What if you don't have any rhythm?
Choir Teacher
Excuse me?
Cartman
Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
Kyle
Shut up, fatass!
Stan
Choirs suck.
Mr. Garrison
Kyle Broflovski, you watch your language!! Eric Cartman, you be nice to people!! Stan Marsh, you mind your manners!! Kenny McCormick, you pay attention!! [sighs deeply and tells the choir teacher] Go ahead.
Choir Teacher
Well, uh, that's all, really. [the girl picks her nose, smiling at Kenny] So, if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir, I'll leave information packets up front.
Cartman
Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. [the other kids laugh]
Mr. Garrison
All right, that does it!!
Mr. Mackey's office. Craig isn't sitting on the bench outside, as he usually is.
Mr Mackey
[behind the door] I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man! [The camera is now inside] You get sent here every day, Craig!
Craig Tucker
I know.
Mr. Mackey
Why can’t you behave?
Craig
...I don’t know.
Mr. Mackey
What do you have to say for yourself?! [nothing] Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh- [Craig sticks his right middle finger up] Did you just flip me off?
Craig
No.
Mr. Mackey
Yes you did, you just flipped me the bird! Now, see? This is exactly what I'm talking about! If you don't shape up, m'kay, and get your head straight, uh- [Craig flips Mr. Mackey off again] There! You just flipped me off again!
Craig
No I didn’t.
Mr. Mackey
Yes you did! And until you stop flipping people off, you can just go back to the waiting room, m'kay?! Next! [Craig hops off the chair as the door opens. The boys enter.] Well, well, well, if it isn't Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Eric. [Craig exits]
Kyle
Hey, Craig.
Eric
Ey, don't flip me off, you son of a bitch!
Mr.Mackey
Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-
Stan
It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, young man, "Getting Gay With Kids" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.
Kyle
Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use pre-recorded tapes.
Mr. Mackey
Well, guess what, boys? I think that "Getting Gay With Kids" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.
Stan
What?!
Kyle
You can't do that! [Cartman's jaw drops]
Kenny
Woohoo! [the boys look at him] I mean, 'Oh...' [looks down]
Mr. Mackey
I think this will be very good for you [writes their names down]
Stan
But we don't even care about the rainforest.
Mr. Mackey
And that's exactly why you need to go!
Cartman
[drops down and pleads] Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
Kyle's house, some days later. The Get Gay With Kids bus pulls up to Kyle's house to pick up Kyle, Cartman, and Stan.
Sheila
Be safe, Kyle. Bring me something back from the rainforest.
Choir Teacher
Oh, nonono. The rainforest is very fragile. We must take only pictures and leave only footprints.
Sheila
Oh, I didn't realize.
Choir Boy
Did you know that right now, bulldozers are tearing down thousands of acres of rainforest every day?
Cartman
[as he enters the bus] Aw, man, this is gonna suck donkey balls.
Stan
[As Sharon drags him to the bus] Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
Sharon
Stan, you should be excited. I would love to see the rainforest. Besides, your dad and I need some time alone. [tosses him into the bus]
Stan
Nooo-ho! [The door closes and the bus pulls away. Stan and Kyle look out the back window in dismay]
Choir Teacher
Okay, children, that's all of us. We're ready to head for the Latin American nation of Costa Rica, a country filled with virgin rainforest.
Cartman
Whoopee.
Choir Teacher
And you must be Eric Cartman. I've heard about you. You don't respect nature or other cultures.
Cartman
Yeah, pretty much.
Choir Teacher
Well, I'm gonna change the way you think, kiddo.
Choir Girl
[Kenny sits next to her] My name's Kelly.
Kenny
My name’s Kenny.
Kelly
Lenny?
Kenny
No, Kenny.
Kelly
Johnny?
Kenny
KENNY!
Kelly
Oh. [looks away and picks her nose.]
Choir Girl
Now, we've got a looong trip ahead of us, so let's take the opportunity to learn our choreography.
Cartman
[hushed] The nightmare begins.
The bus rolls along. A map pops up, showing the bus's route, and Latin music plays. It crosses the border at Mexicali, goes down the Baja peninsula, takes a ferry to Mexico and cuts across the North to the Gulf, then snakes down Central America to Costa Rica. They arrive at San José.
Choir Teacher
Oh, look, children! I think we're entering San José, which is the capital of Costa Rica. [the kids move to their windows and look out] Oh! This is so exciting!
Cartman
Oh my God! Dude, look at how dirty and crappy everything is!
Choir Teacher
Eric, Costa Rica is a Third-World country. These people are much poorer than those in the U.S.
Cartman
Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?! [Throws open his window and yells] Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
Choir Teacher
Eric, sit down!
Cartman
[sits] Look, you've gotta be firm with these people or they just slack off and be poor forever. Right, Kenny? [Kenny looks at him angrily] Hey, maybe that's it, Kenny. Maybe you're Costa Rican; that's why your family's so poor.
Kenny
[to Kelly] Argh! That's not true.
Kelly
[picks her nose] Your family isn't poor? [picks her nose]
Cartman
Whoa, dude, look over there! [The bus stops. There are three women in front of a shop. A man has just dropped them off, pays them and drives away, and they wave at him.] Wow! Costa Rican prostitutes! Hey, look at the prostitutes, you guys!
Redheaded Prostitute
[with heavy accent] What are chu looking at, man?
Middle Prostitute
Yeah, why don't chu take a peekture?
Cartman
Okay. [pretends] Kugheek! [grins]
Choir Teacher
Eric, SIT DOWN!
The bus stops at the Centro Nacional de Costa Rica and all exit.
Choir Teacher
Kids, this is the Costa Rican Capitol building. This is where all the leaders of the Costa Rican government make their-
Cartman
[rushing out] Oh my God, [covers his nose] it smells like ass out here.
Choir Teacher
Alll right, that does it! [turns Cartman around] Eric Cartman, you respect other cultures this instant!
Cartman
[covers his nose again] I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
Kelly
Wow, seeing a place like this really makes you appreciate living in America, huh?
Kenny
[in bliss] Uh-huh. [Kelly picks her nose again]
Choir Teacher
You may think that making fun of Third-World countries is funny, but let me-
Cartman
I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
Choir Teacher
Eric, will you please, please, just keep your mouth shut while we present ourselves to the Costa Rican President?
Cartman
Why?
Choir Teacher
Because I'll buy you some ice cream afterwards if you do.
Cartman
Eh-heheh!
Inside the Capitol. All seem to be facing the President.
Choir Teacher
Well, it was a long trip, but the children are very excited to sing tomorrow.
El Presidente
[long pause] ¿Qué?
Choir Teacher
Uh, we're, uh, we're the choir? That, that was sent from... the United States?
El Presidente
[long pause] ¿Qué?
Choir Teacher
We're the group singing for the "Save The Rainforest" summit tomorrow? [her head is cocked way to the left by now. El Presidente has no clue. Now the teacher is worried] Oh dear, where's, where's Mr. Mackey? He should have been here by now. [faces the kids] Children, do any of you speak Spanish? [Cartman waves his left arm] Don't you dare! [the main door opens]
Mr. Mackey
[rushing in] Sorry I'm late.
Choir Teacher
Ogh! Thank goodness you're here; I don't speak any Spanish.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, no problem. [to El Presidente and his men] Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?
El Presidente
¡O! ¡O! Save The Rainforest.
Choir Teacher
Yeess!
El Presidente
Pablo los llevará en un tur de la jungla. [Pablo appears]
Mr. Mackey
Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour.
Choir Teacher
Oh boy! Mr. Presidente, round up your subjects outside. We have a special gift for you. The gift... uh-of song. [moves aside]
El Presidente
[long pause] ¿Qué?
On the Capitol steps.
Choir Teacher
All right, children, Let's get in our rows quickly, so we can begin.
Kelly
[walks over to Kenny, her partner] Did you remember all the choreography, Lenny?
Kenny
Yeah, I think so.
Choir Teacher
Hello, everybody. This is just a little rehearsal for tomorrow, so we may be a little rusty. [chuckles and shrugs. The people just look. She presses the play button. The kids begin to dance to the music]
The Tape
[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
[Men sing]There's a place that is magical, and full of rain.
[Women sing] But now it needs help, because it is in pain.
[Men sing] Cleaning the earth is a mighty big chore
[All sing] We're spreading awareness like never before!
[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here! [Kyle is out of step now]
To spread the word and bring you cheer
Let's save the rainforest! What do you say?!
Being an activist is totally gay!

[Bridge. Man sings] Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
[Woman sings] There'll be nothing but rainforests covering the entire world!
[Man joins her] World!
[Chorus. Kids rush into the audience and bring some members back as new partners]
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's save the rainforest! It's totally gay!
It's totally gay!
[The kids regroup and Kyle stumbles into place. The tape is stopped and the subjects just walk away]

Choir Teacher
Great job, gang! You were really all over the place, Kyle.
Kyle
Thanks!
Cartman
I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
Kyle
Fuck off, Cartman!
Stan
No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
Kyle
[alarmed] No! That's a stereotype.
Stan
Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. [Camera closes in on a stunned Kyle]
Next day, the sun rises over a sea of green, the canopy of the rainforest. The choir teacher and her group are touring with Pablo.
Pablo
This is now secondary rainforest we are entering. Notice the canopy of foliage.
Choir Teacher
Oh, it's everything I ever dreamed it would be!
Kyle
God-damn, it's hot out here!
Stan
[sees a branch] Aaah! Snake!
Kyle
No, dude. That's a branch.
Stan
Oh. [sees it again] Aaah! Snake!
Kyle
No. That's the same branch again.
Stan
Oh.
Pablo
[turns and stops the group] The rainforest is very delicate, and we must take steps to protect it.
Cartman
[impatient] Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah. [Pablo looks at him] We hear this a million times back up in the States.
Pablo
Here! Look! These are squirrel monkeys. [one sits in a tree, resting] Endangered inhabitants of the rainforest.
Kelly
Wow! Isn't he neat, Lenny? [takes a picture]
Cartman
[takes a branch and starts beating the monkey] Bad! Bad monkey! [it screams in pain]
Choir Teacher
Eric, what the heck are you doing?? [the monkey flees]
Cartman
[stops] I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, “Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!” and I smack him on the head!
Pablo
And here is a three-toed sloth. [hangs from a branch with all four legs]
Cartman
[takes the branch and starts beating the sloth] It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
Choir Teacher
[pulls him away] Eric, for God's sake, knock it off!!
Cartman
[throws the branch at the sloth] Re’spect my authoritah!
Choir Teacher
Well, Mr. Pedro, this was a great tour, but I guess we should be getting back. We have a big concert tomorrow, Don't we, kids?!
Kids
YEAH!
Choir Boy
I wish we could have seen the Yanogapa.
Kyle
What's the Yanogapa?
Choir Teacher
The Yanogapa are gentle native people that live in the rainforest, but bulldozers are destroying their homes. Soon, they will have nowhere to go. So we must stop bulldozing the rainforest so that they can live-!
Cartman
[fed up, buries his face in his mitts] Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!
Stan
AAAAAAA! [hides behind a girl]
Choir Teacher
Stanley, what is it?
Stan
SNAAAKE! [all see and gasp]
Pablo
[standing next to the snake wrapped around a tree trunk] Oh, yes. Uh this is what we call a coral snake. Notice the red markings. Quite an amazing creature.
Stan
AAAAAAA! [runs farther back]
Pablo
What's the matter, little boy?
Cartman
He's a little wuss, what's it look like? [Stan is hiding behind some foliage]
Stan
[lifts some away] I'm just a-scared of snakes.
Pablo
Naw, naw. You must remember. This snake is more afraid of us than we are of it. [the snake jumps out of the tree and wraps itself around him, suffocating him] Oh!! [the snake bites him all over the face. Stan looks and drops the foliage so as to hide, and Pablo falls] Agh.
Choir Teacher
[in horror] Oh my God!! [the snake starts swallowing Pablo]
Cartman
Yeah, that snake is really scared of us all right!
Choir Teacher
[petrified] Jesus Christ, is he dead?! [Pablo's bones come out of the snake's anus]
Stan
Dude!
Kyle
My guess would be yes.
Choir Teacher
Oh, no! God, no, no! [spins around] Don't panic, children.
Cartman
[beats the snake, which turns and comes at him] Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! [hurries away, and the snake gives chase]
The sun sets over the rainforest. The choir teacher now guides the group…
Choir Teacher
Maybe we came from that way. [points to her left] No, nno. Let's try this way. [points to her right and moves that way]
Kelly
[walking behind Kenny] Benny? Do you think we're gonna be okay?
Kenny
[stops] Yeah. Everything is fine.
Kelly
That's good. Can I tell you something?
Kenny
Okay.
Kelly
I think I like you. [holds his shoulder]
Kenny
Really?!
Kelly
[releases] Yeah. I mean, I think we communicate really well.
Kenny
Oh, that's great!
Kelly
[looks away] No, that's not good.
Kenny
That's not good?
Kelly
No. See, if I start to like you too much, [looks away] I'm only going to get my heart broken. 'Cause we live on opposite ends of the country. [looks at him again] Once this choir tour is over, we'll never see each other again. [grabs him and gets emotional] And that would devastate me. [lets go] So I can't have any feelings for you, I just can't, Lenny! [walks away]
Kenny
[pissed] Aaaargh!
Choir Teacher
Oh, children, the sun is setting. We have to find our way out of here quick!
The sun sets and the moon appears over the rainforest. Lightning flashes and the camera slowly drops to ground cover.
Choir Teacher
Whoa-kay, okay, everything is just fine, kids. Now it is important that we all stick together. Is everybody still here?
A Boy
I’m not.
Choir Teacher
Who's not?!
A Boy
Me.
Kelly
Benny, will you hold my hand? [picks her nose. When she lowers her hand, Kenny grabs it, but she looks away] I don't want to get emotionally attached, though.
Stan
Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
Lightning flashes and the group is seen sitting in a row on the ground with Tony Danza visible seated in the middle next to the choir teacher.
Choir Teacher
No, you didn't just see Tony Danza, Stanley.
Next day. The sun rises over the Centro Nacional. A rooster crows. A massive stage is prepared for the Save the Rain Forest summit. It looks like an amphitheater, with a scaffold holding ten speakers over the stage and bullhorns atop the pillars. Balloons and a Save the Rain Forest banner are also anchored to the scaffold.
El Presidente
[on stage] Bueno, bueno. Pongan el arcoiris al lado de las tortugas muertas. (Put the rainbow next to the picture of dying sea turtles.) [the worker moves along]
Mr. Mackey
[approaching] Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)
El Presidente
¿Qué tal? ¿Está todo bien? (Oh hello. Is everything going okay?)
Mr. Mackey
Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)
El Presidente
¡¿QUÉ?! (WHAT?!)
Mr. Mackey
Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)
El Presidente
¡¿Está bromeando, Mackey?! ¡¡¡Más de cien mil personas atenderan este evento!!! ¡¿Y me dice usted que no tendré a mis chiquitos lindos para que les canten?! (You've got to be kidding!! I have over a hundred thousand people coming to this event!!! Are you telling me that I have no darling little kids to sing to them?!)
Mr. Mackey
Estoy seguro que-uh-mmm, que-aaah llegá- llegáran. No se preocupe. Eh, olvidelo, ¿yeah-mbien? (I am sure they'll get here. No problem, forget I said anything.)
At the same time, in the rainforest, the group rises and marches on.
Kyle
Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
Kelly
We are?
Choir Teacher
Don't worry, Kelly. We're gonna find our way out of the rainforest and make it back to the concert in time. We just need to respect our mother rainforest so that she will respect us.
Kyle
Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
Miss Stevens
Oh, really? Could you brush it off? [shows her backpack, and a huge insect half her size growls on it]
Kyle
Um, no.
Miss Stevens
[panics] Oh, boy oh!! Oh my God, get it off me!! For the love of God, get it off me!! Oh my God!! [the insect growls and falls silent. Miss Stevens returns] Oh-okay, children. We must understand that the insects of the rainforest help the delicate balance of life here. [sees the insect, still on her back] Oh my God!! [runs off]
Kyle
Rainforests suck! I wanna go home!
Kelly
Me, too! [the rest start to groan]
Miss Stevens
Shh. Children, okay, let's try to listen to what the rainforest tells us. And if we use our ears she can tell us so many things. Perhaps-
Kyle
[Kyle runs into an adult] Aaaaa! There's a dude here! [a soldier holding a shotgun]
Miss Stevens
Oh, thank goodness! Hello, sir. We are lost. [giggles] Cah heh, can you help us?
Solider
¿Qué?
Cartman
[moves forward] Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca. [the soldier listens] We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. [rubs his belly]
Stan
I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
Cartman
Y taco.
Kyle
I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
Cartman
Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
Miss Stevens
Boys, please. Not every Spanish person eats tacos and burritos. That's a stereotype. [the soldier points a way out with his thumb] Children, he wants us to follow him! Oooh, thank goodness! I think this ordeal is over! [they leave]
The group arrives at a military camp deep in the rainforest. Soldiers go about their maneuvers. The kids pass a small barbed-wire bunker.
Stan
This doesn't look very safe.
Kyle
Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
Miss Stevens
Now kids, let's be a bit more open-minded. I read all about this in Newsweek; this is a people's army. They are fighting the fascist policies of their fascist government. [addresses them with a lilt] Oh, hello. Do you speak of English?
People's Army Leader
[crisp] Who are you?!
Miss Stevens
Oh, wonderful! We were lost, and it is such a great coincidence we found you. You see, we're here to protest the government-sanctioned raping of your rainforest. [the soldiers just stare] We are fighters, just like you. Could you help us get back to San José? [no response] Um... [thinks] Oh, I know! Perhaps you would like a gift. Well, we have o-honly-hee one gift to give. The gift... of song [she moves aside]
Kids
Honh. [she presses the play button, and the song plays. The kids begin to dance]
Miss Stevens
[through clenched teeth] Kyle, for the love of God, do the right choreography. [as the chorus nears, Kyle is still doing the wrong moves] Oh, Kyle, please! [the kids dance through the first line of the chorus...]
People’s Army Leader
Enough! [the music stops]
Miss Stevens
Well, we hope that our gift of song has warmed your hearts.
People’s Army Leader
We're not getting gay with any kids, okay?
Miss Stevens
Uh, yah, soooo, do you have a phone we could use?
People’s Army Leader
Heehee yes, we have a phone. It's right over there next to the 12-person jacuzzi. [the other men begin to laugh] Now, get out of here before we kill you!
Miss Stevens
[sullen] Is it because of the little Jewish boy's choreography?
Kyle
Hey!
People’s Army Leader
[the soldier next to him cocks his shotgun] You white Americans make me sick! [emphasizes his disgust with thumps on the table] You waste food, oil, and everything else because you're so rich, and then you tell the rest of the world to save the rainforest because you like its pretty flowers.
Two Costa Rican soldiers can be seen behind the gasoline barrels. They pop up and open fire. The people's army immediately responds, and bullets fly everywhere. The kids scream.
People’s Army Leader
[waving the choir away] ¡Rapido, rapido! [Kenny steps in front of Kelly to shield her from any shots coming their way]
Miss Stevens
Run, children, run! [the choir moves out]
Back in San José.
El Presidente
¡¿Donde putos está el coro?! ¡El espectáculo comienza pronto! (Where the hell is our choir?! The show is supposed to start soon!)
Mr. Mackey
No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estáran aqui. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)
Back in the rainforest. The choir now walks along a river bank.
Miss Stevens
Hello?? Anybody?? Help??
Choir Boy
Wow, look at the pretty flower. [stops by to touch a huge yellow flower with blue support on a large green stalk]
Miss Stevens
Oh nonono, Jake. That fragile flower is very delicate, okay? [before she could finish the sentence, the flower wraps its petals around Jake and pulls him off the floor.]
Jake
Aaaah. Ugh, help!
Miss Stevens
[quakes] Ga-ow! [quickly grabs Jake's feet and pulls. The choir walks on]
Kelly
[crying and pouting] I wanna go home! [Kenny stops and turns] I hate the rainforest!
Kenny
[walks up and puts his arm around her] Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear. [comforted, she smiles]
Kelly
[gushing] Oh Lenny, hold me. [moves away] No, I can't get attached. [pause, then moves closer] Oh, but I do like you.
Kenny
Well, I like you-
Kelly
[moves away] Oh, but you're only going to leave me.
Kenny
[pissed] Oh, God damn it!
San José. The reporters for the telecast have arrived and are in position.
Short Reporter
We're here live in San José, Costa Rica, where hundreds of rich Americans have gathered for the Save the Rain Forest summit. Everyone is here so they can feel good about themselves, and act like they aren't the ones responsible for the rainforest's peril.
Slim Reporter
That's right, Bob, and of course the main attraction today is the darling kids' choir, "Getting Gay With Kids," all of whom must be backstage preparing at this very moment.
The rainforest. The terrain looks familiar…
Miss Stevens
[the problems mount] Oh, there's just no end to this place! I think maybe we're going in circles. Oh, dear God! The summit starts in an hour; I'm gonna lose my job! [another large insect roars behind her backpack, and she jumps] Aaaah!
Cartman
[turns and walks back the way they came] This is bullcrap! I am not following this stupid hippie around anymore.
Miss Stevens
Eric, where are you going?
Cartman
I'm going this way!
Miss Stevens
Young man, I am the adult here, and I say you go this way!
Cartman
[stops] Look: you can stay over nyah [gestures towards her], but I'm going over nyah. [Gestures away from her]
Miss Stevens
Young man, I have had it!!
Cartman
Nononono! You nyah, me nyah! [gestures forward and backward] Screw you guys, I'ma going home. [walks away]
Miss Stevens
Good! You deserve to die, you little bastard! [the others watch him leave] Eric, we have to stay together!
Eric moves through the rainforest.
Cartman
God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat- [finds himself at a clearing full of bulldozers moving wood around] Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! [rushes in]
Back by the river.
Stan
Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
Kyle
Yeah. It happened once before.
Miss Stevens
No. The Spirit of Maya has told me to go this way.
At the clearing.
Cartman
[reaches the foreman] Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
Foreman
What are you doing here, little boy?
Cartman
I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
Foreman
Lost in the rainforest? Oh, my Lord! Where are all the others?
Cartman
Food! I have to have food! [falls on his face]
Fireman
Oh my God! Get this child some food, quick!
Cartman
[lifts his head] Chicken wings. [drops it]
Foreman
Chicken wings!
Cartman
[lifts his head] Medium spicy. [drops it]
San José
Crowd
Start the show! Start the show! Start the show!
El Presidente
La gente está ansiosa. Dentro de poco, se alborotan y empiezan a tirar chorchadas. (The activists are getting anxious. They will start throwing things soon.)
Mr. Mackey
Estoy seguro que llegáran. Eh-solo poquito mas de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)
El Presidente
Bueno, voy a entretenerlos con mis chistes de Polacos. [heads for center stage] (Well, I will try and amuse them with my Polish Jokes.)
Mr. Mackey
Mbien.
El Presidente
[on the mike] ¿A cuantos Polacos les toma a comerse un burrito? [the crowd is silent. He holds up two fingers] Dos. [seeing no reaction, he laughs, then tries again] ¿A cuantos Polacos les toma a manejar a Panamá? (How many Pollacks does it take to eat a burrito? Two. How many Pollacks does it take to drive to Panama?)
In the rainforest, the choir keeps walking.
Miss Stevens
Oh God, this is a nightmare! We're never going to make the festival!
Stan
Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? [a column of smoke is seen floating above the canopy]
Miss Stevens
Let's go, quickly! [they rush towards the column and find a small campfire]
Kyle
Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. [the shrubs around them rustle, and they face the shrubs. Some big-lipped dwarves surround them.]
Miss Stevens
Children, it's the Yanogapa. [to the dwarves] Do not be afraid. We are not here to tear down your rainforest. [the group is surrounded by spear-bearing Yanogapa men.]
Yanogapa 1
Damtilié?
Yanogapa 2
Damtilié?
Miss Stevens
[marveling] Look how they live in peace with all living things. Gentle, noble... [the Yanogapa raise their spears high] Run for your lives, children!
Stan
Holy crap! [all run]
Yanogapa
[giving chase and throwing spears] Damtilié! Damtilié! Damtilié!
Stan
Jesus Christ!
Miss Stevens
Run run ruuun! [A huge insect lands on her backpack and roars. She looks back and the insect flies away] Waaah!
Kelly
[trips and falls down] Aaaaa! Lenny! [Kenny goes back, helps her up, and they keep running. The choir runs across a puddle of quicksand and begin to sink]
Kyle
What the hell?
Stan
We're sinking.
Miss Stevens
It's quicksand, people! [the Yanogapa warriors surround them and leap with excitement, still screaming "Damtilié!"]
The Yanogapa village. Heads of unfortunate trespassers hang on poles. An abandoned camera is among them. Further on, the choir is found seated around a campfire... tied up individually.
Stan
All we ever heard growing up was, "Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile"!
Kyle
Yeah! Fragile my ass!
Kelly
Larry, if we make it out of this, I want to be your girlfriend. Even if we do live in different places, I don't care! [snuggles up to him]
Kenny
(Kelly, you said it!) [she tries to pick her nose, but the ropes won't let her]
The Yanogapa men are apparently no different than other men. They have dressed Miss Stevens in a skimpy home-made red-and-white cheerleading outfit, complete with pom-poms, then strung her up between two trees. They dance around her, chanting "Damtilié"
Miss Stevens
[put off] Okay. Just what the heck is going on here, people? [a giant Yanogapa rises from the brush and his voice rumbles across the rainforest. She responds] AAAAA!!
Kelly
Oh no, that big thing is going to make love to Miss Stevens!
Miss Stevens
All right, that does it!! [the men stop dancing] Goddamn stupid-ass rainforest!! This place fucking sucks!! [the giant Yanogapa is shocked] I was wrong!! Fuck the rainforest!! I fucking hate it, I fucking hate it!!
Stan
Oh, now she figures it out.
A bulldozer appears, driven by the foreman.
Foreman
Quick! Everybody help the children!
More bulldozers enter and spread out. The workers go after the Yanogapa and chase them away. The children brighten up considerably. One bulldozer scoops up a group of Yanogapa and crushes them against a tree, killing them, then backs up over a coral snake, crushing it to bits, then rolls forward over a large insect, crushing it.
Stan
Wow!
Kyle
Dude! Bulldozers rule!
Foreman
[cutting the ropes off the kids] Come on! Let's get you back to civilization!
Kids
HOORAY!!
Miss Stevens
[being cut down by a worker] Hooray, children!
Later, Miss Stevens is back in her regular clothes and sits on a gasoline barrel. Kyle sits on another one, and the rest of the kids take positions all over the bulldozer. All sip lemonade.
Miss Stevens
How did you know where we were?
Foreman
Your little friend helped me out.
Miss Stevens
Eric?
Cartman
[arriving] Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
Miss Stevens
What exactly are you guys doing out here, with all this ...construction equipment?
Foreman
We're clearing out big sections of the rainforest for a lumberyard.
Miss Stevens
Really? [excited] That's great!!
Foreman
You mean, you don't mind?
Miss Stevens
Nooo, I hate the rainforest! You go right ahead and plow down this whole fucking thing!
Foreman
That’s swell!
Kelly
Okay, Benny. So in order for our long-distance relationship to work, we'll have to call each other every other day.
Kenny
Okay. I can do that. [lightning strikes him, knocking her away] (Christ!) [he falls, she gets up and goes to him]
Kelly
Aaaah! Lenny! No! [Stan and Kyle rush in]
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
Kyle
You bastards!
Kelly
[turns to face them] Whah?? Who?! Who killed him?!
Stan
They did.
Kelly
Who's "they"?!
Stan
[pause] You know, "they."
Kyle
They're... they're bastards.
Kelly
Well don't just stand there, help him!!
Kyle
What?
Stan
Help ...him?
Kelly
Aaagh! [turns around and pounds on Kenny's chest] Come on, Benny! Breathe! [she tries giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, then pounds on his chest again] Breathe, you son of a bitch! [she picks her nose, then pounds some more. Kenny coughs, and she listens]
Kyle
Whoa, dude!
San José. The choir is now at the Save the Rain Forest summit stage.
Summit Host
And now, here to teach us about the rainforest is Getting Gay With Kids. [the crowd applauds]
Miss Stevens
Does everybody remember the new lyrics? [the kids nod yes] And…
The New Lyrics

[Intro] Tootin' tootin' to, tada choo choo wow!
[Men sing] There's a place called the rainforest; it truly sucks ass.
[Women sing] Let's knock it all down and get rid of it fast.
[Men sing] You say, "Save the rainforest," but what do you know?
[All sing] You've never been to the rainforest before.
[Chorus] Getting Gay With Kids is here! [Kyle still can't dance]
To tell you things you might not like to hear. [Kenny and Kelly exchange glances]
You only fight these causes 'cause caring sells.
All you activists can go fuck yourselves!

Male Activist
That was so inspiring.
Female Activist
What a wonderful message.
The New Lyrics, part II

[Bridge. Man sings] Someday if we work hard, boys and girls,
Each year, the Rainforest is responsible for over three thousand deaths from accidents, attacks or illnesses.
[Woman sings] There'll be no more rainforests left in the entire world!
There are over seven hundred things in the Rainforest that cause cancer.
[Man joins her] World!
Join the fight now and help stop the Rainforest before it's too late.
[Chorus]
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
To spread the word and bring you cheer. Yeah!
Getting Gay With Kids is here!
Let's knock down the rainforest! What do you say?!
It's totally gay! It's totally gay!

End of Rainforest Shmainforest

Spontaneous Combustion
General Store. The boys are shopping…
Stan
[with an air pump] Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?
Kyle
No, I don't think so.
Kenny
[bringing a hair dryer] (How about this?)
Kyle
No, that's a hair dryer!
Manager
May I help you find something?
Kyle
Yeah. Do you have any "nurections"?
Manager
Any what?
Kyle
I need to get a nurection for my dad.
Manager
Very funny, boys. Go on, beat it. [gestures to the exit with his thumb]
Stan
Why is that funny?
Kyle
Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one. [the boys are suddenly outside, with the door slamming shut behind them] Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? [the boys walk away]
Stan
That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
Kenny
(I know, fucking seriously!)
Kyle
I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
Man
[walks by with his lady] What?
Kenny
(Well, see you guys. I gotta go take the bus out of town.)
Cartman
Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
Kenny
(Yeah, dude. She saved me.)
Cartman
Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
Kenny
(Ach.) [Poof. Stan and Kyle turn. All three are left looking at a charred body]
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Cartman
What the hell happened to him?
Stan
He just... ignited.
Man
[rushing up] What happened?
Woman
[rushing up] I saw it from across the street. He just caught on fire. [Barbrady drives up and screeches to a halt]
Officer Barbrady
[rushes up to the boys] Okay people, stand back. Give the little burnt boy some breathing room.
Blond Man
I've heard about this. This is... spontaneous combustion. But it usually only happens to fat people near open flames.
Man 2
Is it contagious?
Woman
Am I going to spontaneously combust?
Man 3
I hope it doesn't happen to me.
Woman
This is very scary.
City Hall,the Mayor's office. The Mayor is talking with someone.
Mayor McDaniels
The people are panicking about spontaneous combustion. That's why I've assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon. You are the best scientific mind South Park has to offer.
Randy
...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist.
Mayor McDaniels
Right.
Randy
Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.
Mayor McDaniels
Look, you're the only scientist that lives in this town. You have to find an answer before more people combust. You do that, and you'll be the most beloved man in South Park. [Randy begins to daydream]
The Most Beloved Man In South Park. Hands move him over the crowd.
Crowd
Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
Man
We love you, Randy.
Woman
[rushing up] Make love to me, Randy. Please!
Returns.
Randy
Wow.
Mayor McDaniels
Marsh, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you! Find the cause of spontaneous combustion, or else!
Randy
Or else what?
Mayor McDaniels
[pounds on her desk] Exactly!
First Church of South Park. The organ is heard as people gather for Kenny's funeral. Inside, Stan and Kyle hop up to the bier the coffin is on. Cartman tries a couple of times and finally makes it.
Stan
Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
Kyle
Yeah. [The boys hop off the bier and move to the front row for the service as Priest Maxi approaches the coffin. He opens the Bible and reads]
Priest Maxi
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh. There seems to be a lot more takething going on, but there it is. Perhaps if more of you attended church on Sundays [Kevin falls asleep, Stuart reads Gazongas magazine and checks out its centerfold while his wife sniffs], the Lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy…
Mr. Garrison
[to man to his left] Oh, here comes the guilt trip again.
Priest Maxi
Now, let us pray. [all close their eyes and bow their heads] Lord, though we have lost Neil Smith to free agency and Steve Atwater to the Jets, still, we hope our beloved Broncos can bring home another Super Bowl championship, and once again bathe in the glory of your light. Amen.
All
Amen.
Priest Maxi
[raises left arm and fist] Let's go-
All
Let’s go
Priest Maxi
Broncos
All
Broncos
Priest Maxi
Let’s go Broncos
All
Broncos, let's go! [The priest extends the fist and all rise and exit. Three men carry the coffin out]
Stan
Wow, that was short. [Priest Maxi stops them as they leave the pew]
Priest Maxi
Boys, I haven't seen you in church lately.
Kyle
Well, I'm Jewish.
Priest Maxi
You're not too Jewish to worship Jesus, are you?
Kyle
I guess not.
Priest Maxi
Good. Boys, how would you like to perform the Stations of the Cross this Friday night?
Stan
The what?
Priest Maxi
It's like a skit, where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of Jesus Christ.
Kyle
Hey, resurrection! That's what my dad needs!
Priest Maxi
Huh?
Kyle
We'll do it! We'll do it!
Priest Maxi
Wonderful. Here's a book on how to perform it. Don't let me down, boys. [hands it to Kyle and walks away. The cover shows two excited kids under a radiant cross]
Kyle
Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
Stan
I don't know, dude. I'm gonna have to go look in the Bible.
Outside, some of the churchgoers are still around.
Tom
Good night, Jerry.
Jerry
See ya, Tom. Bye, Helen.
Helen
Bye, Jer- aaa! [poof. Now she combusted]
Jerry
Oh my God, another one.
Tom
Helen, no!
Jerry
What happened?
Man 5
[consoling Tom] God must be very angry with us. But why? [looks to the heavens] How have we angered you, Lord?
Stan's house. Randy's in the basement doing preliminary work. He's working on some chemical reactions when the boys come down.
Randy
[to himself] Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.
Stan
Dad, where's our Bible?
Randy
Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
Stan
Or else what?
Randy
Exactly.
Stan
...What?
Randy
Right.
Stan
[after a long pause] Where's our Bible?
Randy
It's in the attic with the old LP's. [the boys start up the stairs...] Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?
Kyle
He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
Randy
New girlfriend?
Stan
Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
Randy
Maybe nothing... [close up] maybe everything.
Stan
...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. [the boys go up the stairs and exit]
Randy
[resumes the reactions] Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do. [the door closes] What?!
Stan's room. Stan reads from the Stations of the Cross booklet while Kyle reads from the Bible.
Stan
Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
Kyle
This is gonna be fun.
Cartman
I'm gonna be Jesus!
Kyle
You're too fat to be Jesus!
Cartman
Oh, and like you're gonna do it, Jew?!
Kyle
Stan should be Jesus.
Cartman
Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! [gestures his intent.]
Kyle
You're such a fat baby!
Cartman
Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. [gestures again, and again]
Kyle
All right, all right, you could be Jesus, you tubby cry-baby!
Cartman
[retorts] Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
Back in the basement…
Randy
All right, all right, let's try it again. Kenny was standing here. Stan, Kyle and Cartman were walking around him. [four men dressed as the boys stand before him] Now, walk. [the men move around] Do you feel hot?
Kenny
Uh, no.
Randy
Damn it! How come you're not combusting? [throws down his clipboard]
Stan
Come on, Randy. You said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight.
Townsman
[rushing in with several other people] Another one! Another one combusted! [pours out the ashes for Randy to see]
Randy
No! Has she been doing anything odd?
Townsman
No, she was just on her way to her new boyfriend's house.
Randy
Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
Cartman
This is stupid. Screw you guys, I'm going home. [walks off]
Randy
No! I think I might have it.
The First Church of South Park, night of Good Friday.
Priest Maxi
Well, well, well. A lot of you came to church. Looks like we're a little "nervous" about this spontaneous combustion thing, huh?
A few people
Yeah.
Priest Maxi
Well, on this blessed Friday let us give thanks for stuff, and things. [all bow their heads] Lord, is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason? I mean, come on! Amen. [Stan and Kyle approach the pulpit, followed by Cartman] And now, some of our darling local children are going to perform the Stations of the Cross. [leaves, and Stan takes over]
Crowd
Awww.
Stan
Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
Kyle
Die! [hits Cartman, dressed as Jesus, with a stick]
Cartman
Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
Crowd
Awww.
Someone
Phew.
Stan
Station Two: Jesus takes his cross.
Cartman
[now carrying the cross] This cross is seriously heavy. Oh man, this is totally weak.
Stan
And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. [this is not part of the Stations]
Cartman
Peter!
Kyle
I don't know you, dude.
Cartman
Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
Night, the Mayor's office. She's wearing a mud mask in bed and reading Gazongas. The phone rings.
Mayor McDaniels
Mayor.
Randy
[calling from his lab] Mayor, I have it. I found out why people spontaneously combust.
Mayor McDaniels
Why?
Randy
Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. [his clipboard indicates].
Girlfriend --> DEAD
Boyfriend --> DEAD
Call a town meeting tomorrow

Mayor McDaniels
Okay. If you're right about this, Marsh, you're going to be the most popular man in South Park.
The Most Popular Man In South Park. Hands move him over the crowd.
Crowd
Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!
Man
We love you, Randy.
Woman
[rushing up] Make love to me, Randy. Please!
Returns.
Randy
Wow. [hangs up the phone]
Mayor McDaniels
[hangs up the phone] Shmuck!
At the church, Stan continues the Stations. Cartman is stripped to his underwear.
Stan
Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. [Kyle has tied Cartman to it]
Cartman
Oh! This has gone from weak to superweak! Things cannot get any more weak for me.
Stan
[produces a crown of thorns] Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, "Thanks."
Cartman
Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven. [Stan replaces Cartman's cap with the crown] So I guess it's cool. [Stan returns to the pulpit]
Stan
Cartman
[on his way out the door] Hi, mom. [Stan leaves the pulpit and the priest returns]
Priest Maxi
Thank you, boys. Blessed be the name of Jesus!
Crowd
It's a great name, isn't it? [Stan exits]
Stan and Kyle now carry Cartman on the cross and are headed towards a hill. Kyle has the heavier end.
Kyle
Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
Cartman
Yeah. I told you I'd be a sweet Jesus, you guys.
Kyle
Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
Cartman
Up your ass with broken glass!
Stan
This spot looks good. [they drop the foot of the cross into the spot and lift the rest of the cross upright, then leave]
Kyle
Yeah. That looks pretty good.
Stan
Okay, cool. See you, Cartman.
Cartman
Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! [they stop and turn]
Stan
Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
Kyle
Yeah, me too.
Cartman
Well, get me down from here!
Kyle
Cartman, how stupid are you?! Didn't you read the Bible? We have to leave you up there until you die, and then you come back to life in three days.
Cartman
What?!
Stan
Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
Kyle
Then I can give it to my dad. [both turn and leave]
Cartman
Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home! [looks around] Okay, I'm getting pissed now! [struggles to get loose, but doesn't get anywhere] God!
City Hall, the next day. Stan and Kyle are present for the Mayor's announcement, along with much of the town.
Mayor McDaniels
All right, people. Scientist Marsh and I have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion, and we have finally come up with a solution. Mr. Marsh?
Randy
[approaches with a large book] The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her. [displays a diagram of the digestive system] You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas. [the next page is a diagram of the stomach, showing how food produces methane]
Randy
The methane gathers here in the bowel area [shows the intestines, or the bowels], where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart. [shows the colon, where the gas collects and moves out] Should the gas not be expelled, [shows the gas trapped in the bowels] the methane can build up and then ignite, [shows the bowels exploding] leading to... disaster. [shows picture of Jocelyn Wildenstein, then closes the book] Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.
Townsman
You mean, all we have to do is fart and we won't explode?
Randy
Exactly. [after a while, a fart is heard, then more farts follow as the townsfolk release their gases]
Mayor McDaniels
So, from this day forward, everyone in South Park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes.
Crowd
Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy! [Randy waves back gratefully]
Man
We love you, Randy.
Old Woman
[in a wheelchair] Make love to me, Randy. Please!
Stan
Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.
Kyle
Come on. Let's go see how Cartman is doing with his uh, urection.
The boys go to the hill on which they left Cartman on the cross.
Stan
Wow, he died.
Kyle
Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
Cartman
[wakes up] Hey, there you guys are!
Stan
Cartman??
Cartman
You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
Kyle
How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!
Cartman
You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!
Stan
Look, fatass: after you die and get resurrurected, you'll have all kinds of superpowers, just like Jesus.
Cartman
...Really?
Kyle
Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! [he and Stan leave]
Cartman
[watches them leave] ...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet! [to himself] Dude, superpowers are sweet.
The boys are back in town, and they run across Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey
Hi, boys.
Stan, Kyle
[imitating him] Hi, Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey
Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust?
Kyle
We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!
Mr. Mackey
Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay? [moves his bowels as he hums,] Hmm, come on. Be good, now. [slaps his butt and lets loose]
Kyle
Jesus Christ! [the boys cover their noses with their jackets]
Stan
Sick, dude!
Mr. Mackey
I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night. [laughs]
Kyle
Dude, I think you pooed a lot.
Mr. Mackey
So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay? [laughs]
Stan
Okay, okay, just go away! [Mr. Mackey leaves laughing, and the boys walk on]
Kyle
God, that was not cool at all, dude!
Liane
Oh, hello boys. Have you seen Eric around anywhere?
Stan
Uh. We've been taking care of him.
Kyle
Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
Liane
Oh, all right. I was just at the store buying some apples.
Stan
Apples?
Liane
Yes. Apples. [farts] Ahapples, get it? [the boys cover their noses again]
Stan
Dude!
Kyle
Sick!
Liane
Stinky apples. See you, boys. [leaves]
Stan
I don't think I like this new law.
Liane
[returns] Squeaker! [farts, then leaves]
The boys return to City Hall to see the rest of the ceremony. The people in the crowd all have their noses covered. A covered statue stands next to Randy.
Mayor McDaniels
And so I declare today Randy Marsh Day, where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion. Gentlemen? [her aides unveil a nicely muscled concrete statue of Randy]
Bearded Man
You're the best, Randy!
Randy
I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.
Kyle
It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
Stan
Yeah.
Back on the cross...
Cartman
[vultures hover above him] You guys, seriously! somebody get me down from here!
Officer Barbrady
[strolling] Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-
Cartman
Officer Barbrady! [Barbrady looks up to see Cartman on the cross and says nothing for a while]
Officer Barbrady
[taps his chin] T. T is for turtle. [turns and walks away] Nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur…
Cartman
Ey! Help me, you son of a bitch! [to himself] Huh, I'm gonna die up here.
The Nobel Prize Awards. Looks like the Oscars...
Announcer
We now return to the 42nd Annual Nobel Prize Awards. Here again your host, Whoopi Goldberg. [the audience applauds]
Whoopi
[In elaborate dress and geisha hairdo] Republicans are so stupid. [the crowd laughs] I hate Republicans. [the audience laughs] Republicans are so stupid. [the audience laughs] And now, here to present the Nobel Prize for Science is Nick Nolte [fanfare. The audience applauds and Nick steps up]
Nick Nolte
Science is good. Science is very important. This year's nominees are: [the candidates are shown as their names are mentioned]
Herald R. Pinkerton, for his further development of the grand unified theory of physics.
Randy Marsh, for his formulated break-wind theory of spontaneous combustion.
And Alphonse Mephesto for his seven-assed Galapagos turtle.

And the Nobel Prize goes to: [opens the envelope] Randy Marsh, for the theory of spontaneous fart things. [the audience applauds wildly]

Mephesto
[in the audience] No! No, this can't be!
Randy
[at the podium, very excited] Whoa hoho, whoa! [grabs his head] Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!
Mephesto
Fixed! Fixed! That was supposed to be my award, Kevin. I'll get him for this. Mark my words.
Back in South Park, Stan and Kyle are on Kyle's couch watching the show.
Stan
Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
Kyle
Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.
In the master bedroom Gerald and Sheila look at Gerald's penis, to see if it'll rise.
Gerald
I'm sorry, honey.
Sheila
It's okay, [picks up the phone] I'll just call some 20-year old and have him come over.
Gerald
What?!
Sheila
[hands up] I'm just kidding.
Gerald
Kidding? Well, that's not funny! That hurt my feelings!
Sheila
Why?
Gerald
Why?! [the door opens]
Sheila
Kyle. [Gerald see him, too]
Kyle
Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
Gerald
Huh?
Kyle
Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! [his parents just look at him. He grins and walks away]
Sheila
We have a very strange little boy, Gerald.
Next day, Cartman on the cross. Stan and Kyle arrive to check up on Cartman.
Stan
Dude, he's still not dead.
Cartman
You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
Kyle
She's not worried about you.
Cartman
Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen. [prepares for a bit of ventriloquism] Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
Stan
That's not your mom calling!
Cartman
[still in falsetto] Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
Kyle
How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
Cartman
You guys, it's too hot out here! I can't do this!
Stan
He is right. It has been getting really hot lately.
Kyle
Yeah, I noticed that too. Let's go get some ice-cold lemonade.
Stan
Hey, yeah! [they turn and walk away]
Cartman
Oh! God-damnit! Urh! You guys! You guys wanna hear my "I hate Stand and Kyle" song?! Ahem.
Cartman
I hate Stan and Kyle
I seriously hate Stan and Kyle...

City Hall. The Mayor and her aides are in shorts and T's.
Mayor McDaniels
My God, it's burning up in here! Can't we crank the AC up some more?
Aide 2
It's already on full.
Randy
[entering, wearing his Nobel medal] You wanted to see me, Mayor?
Mayor McDaniels
Yes, Marsh. We have a new problem, and I think only you can solve it.
Randy
I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes. The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.
Randy
Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.
Mayor McDaniels
All right, all right. Name your price.
Randy
Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
Mayor McDaniels
Done. Just find out what's happening.
Randy
Don't worry, Mayor. I'll find the cause. Or else. Or else what? Exactly. [they just look at him]
Another night on the cross. The Last Temptation of Cartman.
Cartman
[whispering, hoping...] Hey you guys. Seriously. [Chef walks into view]
Chef
[startled] What the-? [sees Cartman on the cross with his head down] Oh, what now?!
Cartman
Chef! Chef!
Chef
[rushes up to him] Children, what the hell are you doin'?
Cartman
Just get me down from here! [Chef does] Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!
Chef
You children shouldn't be crucifying yourselves in this heat.
Chef drives him into town.
Cartman
Sweet. Now, I'm gonna go kill those guys!
Chef
Eric, I have to tell you something, and it's really gonna bum you out.
Cartman
What?
Chef
It's really gonna piss you off.
Cartman
What?!
Chef
This is just a dream. You're still up on that cross.
Cartman
[waking up] Oh, damnit!
Stan's house, basement. A Cheesy Poofs commercial ends as Stan comes down the steps.
Stan
Dad, where's the phone book?
Randy
Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed. [Stan goes back up the stairs and exits. Randy mumbles] Let's see now, when exactly did the temperature start to go up?
Jesus and Pals comes on.
Jesus
Our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in South Park. Let's go to the phones. [beep] Caller, you're on the air.
Stan
Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
Randy
Stan?
Jesus
That's not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.
Stan
Oh.
Jesus
Do you have an opinion on global warming?
Stan
Uh, it... sucks ass.
Jesus
Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let's go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto. [Mephesto appears and sits] Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.
Mephesto.
I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is [brings out a picture of a man, with horns, mustache, and angry eyebrows drawn on] Randy Marsh! [Randy is stunned] It was Marsh's theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!
Randy
Awww crap.
City Hall, the next day. The town is gathered clamoring for Randy to come out.
Townsman
Go get him!
Townsman 1
We want answers!
Townsman 2
You've killed us all!
Townsman 3
Someone's got to pay!
Woman
It's out of control.
inside the Mayor's office.
Mayor McDaniels
Boy, they're really pissed.
Randy
Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, let's go talk to them. Stick by me. [turns and walks to the door. Randy follows. She shows him out and quickly closes the door]
Randy
[turns to the door] Hey!
Townsman 4
You killed us all!
Townsman 5
Shove that Nobel prize up your ass! [Stan and Kyle approach]
Stan
Oh my God, what's going on?
Townsman 6
Now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust, o-o-or we let our farts out and kill our entire planet. Well I, for one, am not farting anymore! [he combusts and others gasp]
Randy
Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.
Townsman 7
We don't want your solutions, phony!
Townsman 8
Give me that! [rips the Nobel medallion from Randy's neck, leaving the strap] Yeah!
Townsman 9
Damn you Marsh! Get out of town!
Townsman 10
You fraud! [two of the townsmen throw the statue onto Randy, who drags it away on his back. The crowd begins to stone him]
Randy
[struggling] Mr. Garrison, help me!
Mr. Garrison
[keeping Randy at arm's length] I, I do not know you, sir.
Townsman 11
Up your-
Townsman 12
Arrn!
Kyle
[throws a stone] Yeah, take that!
Stan
Dude, that's my dad!
Kyle
...Oh, yeah. Sorry.
News 4 Special Report.
Anchor
The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts. [a man combusts in front of his wife and child as he deposits a letter in a mailbox. A milk delivery man combusts after setting down a four-pack of milk. A boy combusts as he rides a bicycle] Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say:
Randy
I-I don't know what to say.
Anchor
What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It's fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch!
Everyone has gone to the Marsh house. Stan and Kyle look out from the living room window as the crowd clamors outside with torches. A man knocks down the trashcan next to the garage.
Kyle
Dude, those people are pissed!
Stan
I know, huh?
Kyle
Where's your dad?
Stan
He's hiding down in the basement. I I don't know what to do.
Kyle
Well, you have to help him, just like I have to help my dad.
Cartman is still on the cross.
Gerald's law firm. The sign reads "Brovlofski & Jackson," so he's got a partner. Gerald sits at his desk looking over papers.
Radio Talk Show Host
Still more up next from the heat wave caused by Randy Marsh. A giant glacier is melting above South Park and the entire town is doomed. And now, these messages.
Bob Dole
Having a hard time with male potency? [Gerald sits up and listens] Well, I don't, and I'm Bob Dole. What's wrong with you? Christ, I'm Bob Dole and I can get it up. [upset, he turns off the radio. The door opens and three prostitutes enter]
Blonde
Are you a lawyer?
Gerald
Yes.
Blonde
We want to sue Randy Marsh.
Gerald
Why?
Blonde
He gave us skin cancer.
Brunette
Yeah. He put the hole in the ozone, and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies. Look. [she takes off her clothes and stands before Gerald dressed in thong panties. The other does the same, and he is in shock]
The Marsh house. Stan and Kyle go to the basement. Randy cowers in a corner wrapped in a blanket.
Stan
What are you doing, dad?
Randy
Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.
Stan
No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
Randy
Hm. Really?
Stan
Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
Randy
Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.
Stan
Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
Randy
What?
Stan
See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, [performs a Vulcan greeting] he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."
Randy
You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right. [gets up and the boys go to the stairs] Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.
Stan
It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. [Randy returns to his work]
Kyle
Dude, that was Star Trek again.
Stan
Huh?
Kyle
"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?" That was Wrath of Khan.
Stan
Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
Randy
All right. Now, let's get to work.
You And Me, Girl
[Intro. Randy mixes some chemicals, then writes some formulas on the chalkboard]
[Randy explains the hold in the ozone layer] I've been telling everybody that you're my girl
[Randy set off a reaction that boils over] Cause I'm not one to be shy
[Randy looks into a microscope] You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, just
[the boys approve] Tell everybody I'm your guy
[Monster chases Randy and the boys all over the house] You and me, girl, it's forever
Sha la la la la laaa
I've been telling everybody that you're my girl,
Cause I'm not one to be shy
[Randy and the boys as a band] I've been telling everybody that you're my girl,
Cause I'm not one to be shy
[Randy and the boys in hearts on moiré] You don't have to go with me if you don't want to, just
Tell everybody I'm your guy
[Randy and the boys floating up through clouds] You and me, girl, it's forever
Sha la la la la laaa
[Randy and the boys play, and a monster appears]
You and me, girl, forever and ever
You and me, girl, forever and ever
You and me, girl, forever and ever... [fade. Randy's humming]

Stan
Dad. Dad! [Randy slowly comes out of his daydream]
Randy
Wow!
Stan
Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
Randy
[looks at Stan] ...Right, right right.
The Broflovski house. Kyle watches TV and Ike plays on the floor. The front door opens.
Gerald
Kyle, where's your mother?
Kyle
She's upstairs.
Gerald
Well, I have something to give to her! [runs by with a big erection in his pants] Don't worry, Kyle. Everything's gonna be okay between me and your mom.
Kyle
Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. [Ike hops onto the armchair next to Kyle]
Another night on the cross.
Cartman
Hello-o.
The Marsh house. The crowd is still clamoring outside.
Townsman 13
Look! There he is!
Townsman 14
Get him!
Randy
Uh. Please, everyone- [the crowd closes in and stones him]
Townsman 15
You're a dead man, Marsh!
Randy
[shielding himself from the stones] Please, just listen to me. I think I found the answer.
Townsman 16
[to Townsman 15] Could I borrow one of your rocks?
Randy
It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.
Townsman 17
Huh? [the people hold their fire]
Randy
I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want. [most of the people drop their rocks, and Stan smiles through the window. A man throws one last rock] Ow.
City Hall, three weeks later.
Mayor McDaniels
And so we salute Randy Marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all. [the Nobel medallion has been repaired and is back around Randy's neck.]
Stan
[to Kyle] See? My dad is the coolest after all.
Kyle
Well, my dad is, too.
Stan
Cartman!
Kyle
I forgot all about him. [they leave]
The boys are not at the foot of the cross.
Stan
He's been up there for like, three weeks.
Kyle
Wow!
Stan
That's amazing!
Cartman
[in a slight falsetto] Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.
Kyle
Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
Cartman
Get me down from here!
Stan
Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
Cartman
Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
"You and Me, Girl" plays.
End of Spontaneous Combustion

The Succubus
The optometrist's office. A penguin sits above the OPTOMETRIST sign. Liane and Cartman are waiting in the lobby. Liane reads a magazine. A poster off to one side reads "Real eyes the beauty within."
Cartman
Mom, please can we just leave?
Liane
You have to see the eye doctor, Eric.
Cartman
But I hate the eye doctor. He always makes fun of me for being fat.
Liane
You're not fat, you're big-boned.
Cartman
That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
Doctor's assistant
[at the door, flatly] Eric Cartman. [a poster behind her looks like her]
Cartman
[enters the examination room] Weak. [the assistant follows him in to close the door.]
Inside, Cartman stops
Optometrist
Hello, Eric.
Cartman
[resigned] Hi, Doctor Lout.
Dr. Lott
How's my little piggy today?
Cartman
[points his finger at him] Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
Dr. Lott
I just say that because you're my little buddy.
Cartman
I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
Dr. Lott
Hop up on the chair. [Cartman hope up] Don't break it now!
Cartman
[turns around and sits] God damn it!
Dr. Lott
Just kidding. Let's see how your eyes are doing. [lowering a refractor to Cartman's eyes] All you have to do is read the letters. Can you see the letters?
Cartman
Yes.
Dr. Lott
All right, read them out for me.
Cartman
I am a little piggy. Ey! [the optometrist laughs. Cartman stands up on the chair and pushes the refractor away.] That does it! Mom!
Dr. Lott
No no. That, that was just a weird coincidence. [voice fades as he removes the card from the refractor] I do not know how that happened. [reads the card] "I am a little piggy." Wow! What are the odds of that? [throws it away] All right, let's get down to business, shall we? [places the refractor back on Cartman's face.]
Cartman
Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
Dr. Lott
[begins to calibrate] Hmm, let's see, which is better: one, or two? One, or two?
Cartman
They look exactly the same.
Dr. Lott
Just pick one. Or two.
Cartman
I don't know, two!
Dr. Lott
[flips between two women] Okay. One, or two? One, or two?
Cartman
Uh, one.
Dr. Lott
[flips between an apple and a tall slice of chocolate cake] One, or two? One, or two?
Cartman
[chooses the cake] Two.
Dr. Lott
No! The answer is one, piggy! One! [hits Cartman through the refractor]
Cartman
Ow! I hate you!
Dr. Lott
[removes the refractor] Yes, there is obviously a problem with your eyes. I am gonna have to dilate them and run some tests.
Lunchtime at the school cafeteria. Stan, Kyle and Kenny stand in line to get their lunches
Kyle
I wonder how come Cartman's not in school today?
Stan
Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
Kenny
{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} [the others laugh]
Kyle
Yeah. [sees Cartman] Oh, here he comes.
Cartman
[with very dilated pupils] Hey dudes.
Stan
[squints hard for a better look] Whoa, what happened to your eyes, Cartman? [Kyle blinks hard]
Cartman
My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
Kyle
Why?
Cartman
Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
Stan
Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
Cartman
Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Kyle
Dude, just ask Chef for help. He always knows what to do.
Cartman
Hey, yeah! [The four enter the kitchen, but Cartman runs into the entrance and falls on his way in.] Ow!
The kitchen. The boys approach the lunch counter
The Boys
Hey Chef!
Mr. Derp
[wearing a hair net and cook's cap] Hello there, children.
Cartman
[rubs his eyes] Dude, my eyes are seriously screwed up. Chef looks like a skinny little white guy.
Mr. Derp
It's time for lunch-e-roo
Stan
Where's Chef?
Mr. Derp
Chef quit.
The Boys
What?!
Mr. Derp
Chef is gone. So let my introduce myself. I'm your new cook, Mr. Derp. [ta-daaa!]
Kyle
Mr. Derp?
Mr. Derp
When I'm in the kitchen, you never know what nutty things are gonna happen. If you like Chef, you're gonna love Mr. Derp. [ta-daaa! Mr. Derp hits himself with a hammer and toddles] Ooo! Derp! [falls to the floor, then gets up] Derp! O-hoh wasn't that silly kids? [laughs, but the boys aren't impressed]
Stan
Why did Chef quit?
Mr. Derp
Aren't I a great character? My antics go right to the funny bone. [takes out a tiny cannon and shoots himself with it. His face is full of gunpowder] Oh, I don't feel so good. [laughs] Derp!
Stan
[after a moment of silence] Could you just hand us some food please?
Mr. Derp
Sure gang! I have yellow stuff or white stuff, huh. Derp!
Cartman
Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
the boys reenter the cafeteria with their lunches
Kyle
Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
Stan
Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
Cartman
I don't know, you guys. That hammer thing was pretty funny. [chuckles]
Kyle
[looks back] Shut up, Cartman!
Chef's house. The boys reach the front door
Cartman
[runs into the door] Ow!
Chef
[wrapped in a lavender towel, opens the door] Oh! Hello there, children!
Stan
Chef, what the hell are you doing? We almost starved to death at lunch today.
Chef
Oh! Didn't they tell you? I quit.
Kyle
Yeah, but we didn't believe them.
Chef
Well, it's true.
Stan
But why? Why would you quit?
Chef
Children, three nights ago I was at the library checking out some books on Kama Sutra when I met the most amazing woman ever. She knew so much about so many things. She really got me thinking. We eventually came back to my place and really hit it off.
Stan
So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
Chef
No no, we just sat there all night long and... taaalked.
Stan
Talked?!
Chef
Yeah. She told me all about the powers of goddess, and how men have been oppressing women for years and viewing them as sexual objects, and I realized that I had done that myself.
Woman
[walks up and looks out] Oh! What darling little children.
Chef
Here she is now. Children, meet my new girlfriend, Veronica.
Stan
[ignoring that statement] That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
Chef
Children, Veronica is moving in with me.
Kyle
Moving in?!
Chef
I'm in love.
Boys
Love?!
Veronica
Oh, you knight. [cuddles Chef]
Stan
What the hell is going on?!
Chef
Veronica spent the whole day sharing her favorite poems with me.
Veronica
[teasing] Sorry boys, looks like I'm stealing Chef away from you.
Kyle
But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
Chef
Well, I can still do that, children. In fact, Veronica can help me. She's a great singer, too.
Veronica
What's the problem?
Cartman
My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
Veronica
Oh, I know just the song for you.
[reaches behind the door and pulls out a guitar. She starts to play it]
There's got to be a morning after
if we can hold on to the night
[the boys are shocked, and Kenny pulls his hood tight]

Chef
[blandly] We have a chance to find the sunshine.

Chef, Veronica
Let's keep on looking for the light.

Kyle
This... is insane. [
"Oh, can't you see the-"

]
On the sidewalk. The boys walk away from Chef's house
Kyle
That bitch!
Stan
She's stealing Chef from us.
Kyle
He didn't even seem like Chef. He seemed like a empty shell of a man.
Cartman
Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
Stan
Wait you guys. [pensive] Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? [the others think about it...]
Kyle
Yeah, so?
Stan
...Yeah, screw that bitch.
Cartman
Bitch, I hate that bitch!
Kyle
Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
Stan
Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
Kyle
Good idea.
The optometrist's office. Dr. Lott sits in the examination room holding a clipboard
Dr. Lott
All right, we got the test results back, piggy-
Cartman
[sits on the chair, his pupils normal again] Stop calling me piggy!
Dr. Lott
You've got a small astigmatism that's causing all the problems.
Cartman
So, what does that mean?
Dr. Lott
It means, piggy, that your eyesight is never going to get better.
Cartman
[seething] All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair [throws a fit] and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
Dr. Lott
Well, don't worry. I've got something that's going to make your eyes as good as new. [puts a pair of blocky glasses on Cartman]
Cartman
[after seeing how they look and fit] Oh, dude! Super weak! I'm not wearing these; the guys would totally rip on me.
Dr. Lott
I know, the hardest thing to do is get kids to wear their glasses.
Cartman
I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
Dr. Lott
That's why we have the little stapler. [takes it out and starts stapling the glasses to Cartman's head]
Cartman
Ow! Son of a bitch!
The streets of South Park. The boys, without Cartman, are in the business district looking...
Kyle
They said that Chef works in one of these buildings [the boys run into Cartman in front of Steinburg & Burgstein Accounting.]
Cartman
Hey dudes. [the others study him, then laugh. Cartman's hurt, but jabs] Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
Kyle
Dude! Just take them off!
Cartman
I can't! They're stapled to my head! [they study him again, then laugh harder.] I hate you guys.
Inside. The boys enter and see the receptionist
Receptionist
Hello and welcome to Steinburg & Burgstein. Can I help you?
Stan
We wanna talk to Chef.
Receptionist
Chef?
Kyle
He's a big guy, with a beard.
Stan
And a chef hat.
Kenny
{And a real huge dick.}
Receptionist
Oh! The black guy!
Stan
Huh?
Receptionist
Third cubicle on the left [directs them to the work area, where Chef's hat can be seen, but stops Cartman] Hey! Aren't you that cute little kid from Jerry Maguire?
Cartman
[dismissively] Uh, yeah, sure sure.
Receptionist
Wow! You really got fat.
Cartman
Ey!
The boys reach Chef's cubicle
Chef
Hello there, children.
Kids
Hey, Chef.
Chef
Eric, you got glasses!
Stan
Chef, you have to dump the bitch!
Chef
Huh?
Kyle
We need you, Chef.
Man
[pops up from another cubicle] Hey, Chef-o, we're gonna run down to the office supply store and get some leather holders for our pagers, you wanna come?
Chef
You bet! [the guy grins]
Kyle
Chef, this place isn't you!
Chef
Children, Veronica showed me that I've been living a very empty life. Meaningless sex is fun for twenty or thirty years, but after that, it starts to get old.
Stan
But we don't like her.
Chef
Why not??
Stan
I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
Chef
Children, friends get girlfriends all the time. It's something even you will have to face with each other some day.
Kyle
No way, dude!
Cartman
Please, Chef! I don't know what to do about my stupid glasses.
Chef
That's easy! Get some laser corrective surgery. That's what I did.
Cartman
Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
Chef
You see? Everything's gonna be fine. Now how about I meet you boys after work and we can play ball?
Kids
Okay!
The bus stop. The boys wait for Chef. Cartman carries a bat in his right hand and a baseball in his left
Kyle
Chef should be here any minute.
The day passes into night, and Kenny falls asleep. Rats gather and nibble on him. The others stand watch waiting for Chef, but there's no sign of him. The night turns to day, and still no Chef. Kenny wakes up...
Stan
[pissed] Dude! He bailed on us!
Kyle
[pissed] I can't believe it!
Stan
Come on! We're going to his house! [they leave the bus stop]
Chef's house, inside. There's a knock on the door and Chef answers. The boys stand outside, angry.
Chef
Oh! Uh, hello there, children.
Kyle
All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
Chef
Oh, children, I'm sorry. I forgot.
Stan
[sarcastic] You forgot!
Chef
Veronica surprised me at the office and took me out to dinner. [dreamy] She's so amazing.
Kyle
Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
Veronica
[appears behind Chef] Hello, children!
Cartman
Ma'am, we're having a dude moment here, if you don't mind?
Chef
Children, I've got some great news for you. Veronica and I are getting married. [a dramatic riff signals the boys' alarm]
Stan
Oh no! No nononononono!
Chef
My whole family's coming here for the wedding, and I want you boys to come, too.
Veronica
This is so wonderful! Let's sing! [gets the guitar]
There's got to be a morning after.

Chef
[blandly] If we can hold on through the night.

[the boys are truly shocked] We have a chance to find the sunshine.

South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class
Mr. Garrison
And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review. [writes a diagram on the board] Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant. [the bell rings] Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes. [the class leaves, but the boys walk up to Garrison]
Kyle
Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
Mr. Garrison
Sure.
Stan
Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
Mr. Garrison
[asserting himself] Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.
Kyle
All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, the old succubus syndrome.
Stan
What's a succubus?
Mr. Garrison
A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
Kyle
That's it!
Stan
Yeah!
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.
Kyle
This is totally what's happening!
Stan
Wow, you are smart, Mr. Garrison!
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say "get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!"
Kyle
Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Sure, kids. [the boys leave the classroom]
Mr. Hat
You're not fooling anyone!
Mr. Garrison
Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!
South Park business district. The boys head back to Steinburg & Burgstein
Kyle
Come on guys! We gotta go tell Chef he's in love with a succubus.
Stan
Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. [a small station wagon pulls up, driven by Cartman's mom]
Liane
There you are, Eric! Come on, we have to go to the eye doctor.
Cartman
Oh, no!
Liane
Come on. Do you want your laser corrective surgery or not?
Cartman
Yes, but can't we wait until tomorrow.
Liane
Now, hon.
Cartman
But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
Chef's house. People are milling around outside as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive. Stan rings the doorbell, and an elderly gray-haired man answers
Chef's dad
Hello there, children.
Stan
Who are you?
Chef's dad
I'm Chef's father. We just flew in for the wedding.
Kyle
Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
Chef's dad
Well, come on in. [they enter]
Once inside, Chef's dad closes the door
Kyle
There he is! [rushes in]
The fitting room. Chef's dad shows them in, then leaves. A tailor takes Chef's measurements for the pants as Veronica walks by. Chef is wearing the finished coat and shirt.
Stan
Chef, we have to talk to you!
Chef
Who? Not now, children! I gotta get fitted for my britches! Be right back. [hurries away. Stan's head drops, then the boys walk away.]
The living room. The boys reach the sofa and hop up to sit on it. Chef's parents sit across from them on the love seat. An uneasy silence follows
Chef's dad
Well, aren't you crackers just cute as the dickens?
Stan
You're Chef's parents?
Chef's mom
Yes, all his life.
Kyle
We have to talk to him!
Chef's dad
Well, he should be out now directly.
Chef's mom
Oh, he's so excited about the wedding now.
Chef's dad
Say, would you crackers like to hear about the time we saw the Loch Ness monster?
Stan
No, that's okay.
Chef's dad
Ooh, it must've been about seven, eight years ago. Me and the little lady was out on this boat, you see, all alone at night, when all of a sudden this huge creature, this giant crustacean from the paleolithic era, comes out of the water.
Chef's mom
We was so scared, Lord have mercy, I jumped up in the boat and I said "Thomas, what on earth is that creature?!"
Thomas
It stood above us looking down with these big red eyes,-
Chef's mom
Oh, it was so scary!
Thomas
and I yelled. I said, "What do you want from us, monster?!" And the monster bent down and said, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty." [a long silence follows]
Kyle
What's tree-fitty?
Thomas
Three dollars and fifty cents.
Chef's mom
Tree-fitty.
Stan
He wanted money?
Thomas
That's right. I said "I ain't giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn Loch Ness monster! Get your own goddamn money!"
Chef's mom
I gave him a dollar.
Thomas
She gave him a dollar.
Chef's mom
I thought he'd go away if I gave him a dollar.
Thomas
Well of course he's not gonna go away, Nellie! You give him a dollar, he's gonna assume you got more!
The optometrist's office. Cartman is on the examination chair flanked by a nurse on each side. He is wearing a breathing mask. Dr. Lott moves around him
Dr. Lott
Okay, let's get started. You're here for the liposuction, right? [the nurses giggle]
Cartman
Hey! You son of a bitch!
Dr. Lott
All right. Time to laser me a little piggy. [the nurses giggle]
Cartman
Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh- [Dr. Lott turns up the sleeping gas] I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh [the gas knocks him out]
Dr. Lott
I bet his mom wishes she could do that.
Chef's house. Thomas is still telling the story...
Thomas
And that was the third time we saw the Loch Ness monster. Then one time, I believe it was July-
Nellie
August.
Thomas
August. There's a knock on the door. I open it, and there's this cute little girl scout-
Nellie
And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all.
Thomas
And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things-
Nellie
Raisin oatmeal.
Thomas
Raisin oatmeal, and I said "We'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?" And she looks at me and she says, "...Uh I need about tree-fitty."
Nellie
...Tree-fitty.
Thomas
Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era.
Nellie
The Loch Ness monster.
Thomas
I said, "Dammit monster! Get off my lawn! I ain't giving you no tree-fitty!" It said, "how about just two-fitty?" I said, "Oh, now it's only two-fitty!! What?! Is there a sale on Loch Ness munchies or something?!"
Nellie
Lord, he was angry.
Thomas
Damn right, I was angry!
Nellie
Not you, the monster. He was about to kick your ass.
Thomas
Aah, shut your mouth, woman!
Stan
Uh, could you just tell Chef we were here?
Thomas
Sure. That crazy old monster [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk out] Now, then the fourth time I saw the...
Cartman's room. Cartman is in bed recovering from the laser corrective surgery on his eyes. Patches cover his eyes and are taped to his face. There's a knock on his door, and the boys enter
Stan
[disappointed] Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
Cartman
That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
Stan
Damn, your eyes must really suck, Cartman.
Cartman
Oh, thanks for the news flash, Tom Brokaw! What happened with Chef? Did you tell him she's a succubus?
Stan
Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
Liane
[entering] Eric, you have a little visitor. Is that all right? [the others face her]
Cartman
Okay. [Liane leaves, and Veronica soon enters]
Veronica
Hello, boys. I heard Eric had laser surgery, so I made him a pie.
Cartman
Aaah! It's the succubus! [looks in her direction as the others jump, and Kenny pulls his hood tight]
Veronica
Huh?
Stan
We know what you are, lady!
Kyle
Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
Veronica
A what?
Stan
A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
Veronica
[sweetly] Boys, you know how silly that sounds, don't you?
Kyle
Well, you are taking Chef from us. [Kenny has loosened his hood]
Veronica
[sets the pie down on the floor] Boys, come here. I want to explain this to you. I know Chef is your friend, but Chef is a grown man. He has needs you boys can't fulfill. He wants a life with me because I make him happy. Do you understand?
Stan
I guess.
Veronica
Good. Oh and boys. Just one more thing. I'm going to marry Chef tomorrow, [her face becomes that of a demon's, with blood-red eyes and sharp teeth, and her voice grows sinister] And there's not a God-damned thing you can do about it! [laughs evilly. Stan and Kyle jump and scream, and Kenny pulls his hood tight again. Her face resets itself] Toodle-oo! [leaves]
Stan
Jesus dude! [the boys are trembling, and Kenny keeps that hood tight]
Cartman
What? What happened?
King Jimmy's Buffet. A banner spans the front of the restaurant, saying, "Closed for Wedding Rehearsal Dinner Party." Chef, his family, Veronica, and other guests are present. Soft jazz plays in the background.
Thomas
Could I have your attention please? [the guests quiet down and the music stops] Tomorrow, my son is gonna get married to a beautiful lady. [sniffles] I'm very happy for them both. [sobs] Ooh there I go! I told myself I wasn't gonna cry, now.
Chef
It's okay, pop.
Nellie
Thomas, you're gonna get me going now. [sobs]
Thomas
Oh, I remember when Chef was just a three-year-old little man. He came running up to me with a big smile and his little chef's hat on, and he said, "Poppa, poppa!" I said "What do you need, Chef, my boy?", and he said, "...I need about tree-fitty."
Nellie
...Tree-fitty.
Thomas
Well, it was about that time I got suspicious. I said, "Chef, why do you need tree-fitty?" He said, "My imaginary friend Goo-Goo the dinosaur wants it." I went to my son's room, and sure enough, there was the Loch Ness monster!
Nellie
Oh, it was scary!
Thomas
I said, "Dammit monster! You stop bugging my children now! We work for our money in this house and we don't give money away!"
the door opens, and the boys enter
Stan
Excuse me! [the boys stop at the register] We're sorry to interrupt, but we've got bad news. [the boys approach the head table]
Kyle
[pointing to Veronica] This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
Chef
What?!
Stan
Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
Veronica
[hurt] Children! That hurts my feelings.
Kyle
[unmoved] Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
Chef
All right guys! That's enough! I have had it with you! This is the happiest time of my life, and you can't be happy for me!
Stan
Chef, but-
Chef
No buts, Stan! [Veronica starts crying, and he cradles her] I love this woman, and I am marrying her! Now you can either accept that, or get out of my life! Now if you'll excuse us, we're having a party. [the boys exit]
Thomas
So I chased the monster down the street, you see...
Outside, the boys walk away from the restaurant
Kyle
I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
Stan
No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
Cartman's room, morning. Cartman is in bed with patches over his eyes. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are reading books on demonology
Stan
Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
Cartman
You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
Stan
Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
Cartman
You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. [rolls over]
Kyle
Here! Here! Look at this. It says "The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power."
Stan
What the hell does that mean?
Kyle
I don't know.
Kenny
[closes his book and expounds] (Hey, you guys! You guys, I think I know precisely what it's saying. It says that we've gotta go and find a pile of records and get the one that has the entire lyrics, and then we gotta get into learning to rearrange them.)
Stan
Right.
Kenny
(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)
Stan
Yeah?
Kenny
(That's what that means!)
Stan
Oh-hoho!
Kyle
Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings?
There's got to be a morning after.

Cartman
[picks up] If we can hold on to the night.

We've got to find our way together...

Stan
That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
Kyle
[doubting] In three hours.
First Church of South Park. A banner above the lower cross reads "Congratulations Chef and Veronica." People are streaming in for the wedding
Kyle
Ah man! I can't keep my eyes open. [Cartman is nodding off, too]
Stan
We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song. [turns to Cartman] You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? [taps him]
Kyle
He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
Cartman
[rattled] What what what?
Stan
God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
Cartman
I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
Thomas
[telling his tale to Randy and Sharon] ...And then these aliens had me up on their ship, right? They was probing me and all that.
Nellie
We had taco salad that night.
Thomas
Don't matter what we had for dinner woman! Now this alien had a big head and big black eyes, and it was all bent over me. I said, "What do you want from me, alien?!" and do you know what he said?
Nellie
Tree-fitty.
Thomas
Uh. Let me tell the damn story now! He said, "tree-fitty." And so I realized I that it wasn't no alien, it was that God-damned Loch Ness monster again, trying to trick me into giving him tree-fitty by dressing up like an alien. Don't that just beat all?!
Nellie
I had just given him tree-fitty the week before.
Thomas
What?! You gave that monster another damn tree-fitty?!
Nellie
[somewhat defensive] He tricked me.
Thomas
Well no wonder the damn monster keeps coming back to our house! You keep giving it tree-fitty!
The ceremony begins. An usher goes up to a turntable and sets the needle down on a record. Veronica enters in a traditional wedding gown
Stan
There she is! ["Here Comes the Bride" plays. Chef and Priest Maxi await her.]
Stan
[as Veronica walks by] Bitch. Bitch.
Kyle
[joins in] Bitch.
Stan
Bitch.
Kyle
Dirty bitch.
Stan
[to Cartman] All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
Cartman
Okay. [Stan and Kyle leave]
Priest Maxi
Do you, Chef, take this woman as your lawful-wedded wife, to have and to-
Chef
Iii do!
Nellie
Aaah, my baby's getting married!
Priest Maxi
And do you, Veronica, take Chef to be your daddy?
Veronica
I do!
Priest Maxi
And now a special sharing of vows through song.
Stan
[as "A Morning After" begins] Here it goes.
Veronica
There's got to be a morning after. [the needle is removed and there's no more music]
Stan
Now, Cartman! [Kyle holds the needle in his left hand. The crowd gasps and Veronica is pissed]
Kyle
Now, Cartman!! [No response. Cartman is asleep again.]
Chef
[looks over] Children! You are screwing up my wedding! [Priest Maxi and Veronica turn to face them]
Veronica
I'll take care of them! [begins to move towards them]
Kyle
Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! [Kenny punches Cartman]
Cartman
Ow! [Veronica reaches Stan and Kyle, but the backwards version of "A Morning After" soon plays]
Stan, Kyle
[singing on the tape]

Veronica

Chef

Stan, Kyle
-the to on- [the tape balks and reverses to a halt]
Cartman
Oh no! The tape jammed! [Veronica transforms again, this time tearing through the gown, revealing her huge wings and succubus body. The congregation reacts with groans and screams]
Man
Oh my God!
Women
Oh my God!
Chef
What the-?! [everyone else falls silent]
Thomas
She's a goddam Succubus!
Nellie
Succubus trying to take my baby! [the succubus roars and flies into the air. As she hovers over the congregants, they scream and dive under the pews]
Outside, The doors open and people pour out
Inside, Stan and Kyle try to get Cartman's attention again
Stan
Come on Cartman!
Cartman
[pressing every button on the tape player] I can't see anything!
Kenny
[tries to help] (Wait...) [the succubus lands on Kenny, breaking the pew in half. Kenny is dead under her feet]
Stan
Oh my God! She killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastard!
Nellie
[with a stick, runs at the succubus] You damn monster! Get away from my baby!
Thomas
[reaching into his pocket] Hold on, now, I'll see if I have tree-fitty!
Nellie
[gets a few blows in, but the succubus knocks her away] Oh my-
Cartman
[presses the right button] Got it! [music resumes]
Stan, Kyle
-the to on hold can we if after [the succubus grips her head with both hands, roaring in pain]
morning a be to got There's
Warm and safe that's... [the ground opens up, flames appear, and the succubus drops down into the hole. The flames leave with her. Chef walks up to the hold and looks over it]

Mr. Garrison
[sits up in his pew] Hoh, wow! You don't see that every day!
Stan
[walks up with Kyle to Chef] We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
Chef
[sadly] No I'm, I'm glad you did, children. Now that she's gone, I can't really figure out what I ever saw in her.
Mr. Garrison
[to man on his right] Poontang's poontang.
Chef
Come on, children. Let's go get some ice cream.
Stan, Kyle
Hooray! [the three walk out. As they do, people start rising from under the pews]
Cartman
What? What happened you guys? Is Kenny okay?
The cafeteria kitchen. Chef is back at the counter as the boys enter.
Chef
Hello there, children!
Stan, Kyle
Hey, Chef!
Chef
How would you like some fish sticks and tater tots?
Stan
[cheerfully] We'd love them!
Kyle
It's great to have you back Chef!
Chef
Yeah, well, I learned a very important lesson this week:
[begins to sing]
Sometimes you fall in love and you think it feels that way forever.
You change your life and didn't know your friends cause you think it can't get any better.
But then love goes away; no matter what, it doesn't stay as strong.
And then you're left with nothing, cause your tinking with your dong.So watch out for that love bug! It can destroy like a typhoon wind!
Just play it cool and don't be a fool...

Mr. Garrison
[from the entrance] And never let poontang come between you and your friend.

Chef
Daaamn right, Garrison! [song fades out]

The optometrist's office. Cartman walks in with a large ice box. His bandages are off. Now we know why he wasn't at school with Stan and Kyle.
Dr. Lott
Oh, hello, piggy. How are your eyes doing?
Cartman
After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
Dr. Lott
I don't think that's possible, piggy, not with your eyes.
Cartman
No, not with my eyes. With these! [takes Kenny's frozen head out of the box to show the eyes] Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Dr. Lott
Was he an organ donor?
Cartman
Eh-sure.
Dr. Lott
All right, then let's get to work. [Cartman gets in the chair, and the optometrist pulls out Kenny's left eye] Say, you don't have three dollars and fifty cents on you, do you?
Stan, Kyle
[Over end credits"A Morning After" plays backwards]

End of The Succubus

Jakovasaurs
The boys are camping near Stark's Pond. They've set up a campfire and are roasting marshmallows. Cartman plays a harmonica.
Cartman
You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, "I Hate You Guys":
[plays four notes before each line]
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
[the other three glare at him] I hate him the most.

Cartman
Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys.

Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny.

Kyle
This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen. ["Hey you guys, sing the song!"] Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... [Cartman gets up and walks away]
Stan
Where are you going?
Cartman
I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
Kyle
Just go behind a tree.
Cartman
I have to go number two.
Stan
So? You can poo in the wilderness.
Cartman
No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
Kyle
Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
Cartman
Well what do I sit on?
Kyle
You just squat, stupid! [Cartman begins to lower his pants...]
Stan
Not here! Go further away!
Cartman
[moves away] God, I'm glad you guys know all these "pooping outside" rules! [he squats some distance away and begins] Urgh. Come on, now.
Kyle
Watch out for ground eels! [he, Stan and Kenny begin to laugh]
Cartman
Stop, you guys! I can't think!
Kyle
What do you have to think about?
Cartman
I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream... [a dump is heard] Oh, that did it.
Stan
Sick, dude!
In the lake, the water becomes agitated, and a bubble comes up. Cartman pulls out his harmonica and plays again
Cartman
Poopin' outside,
[a rear shot] Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.

Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves? [a yellow creature peeks out between the trees. It is the one looking at Cartman's rear.]

Kenny
(Here you go.) [begins to walk to Cartman, but realizes what it's to be used for] (No way!) [goes back to roasting his marshmallow]
Cartman
[hears some rustling and zips up immediately] What the?
Creature
[running through the trees] Oohma poota!
Cartman
Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!
Stan
[thinking of poo] We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!
Cartman
[urging] You guys, get over here!
Kyle
No way, dude!
Cartman
I'm serious now! [the boys walk over to the spot] Look. Over by those bushes.
Kyle
What?
Creature
Meesa scared!
Stan
I see it!
Cartman
Come on! Let's kill it! [the boys move forward]
Kyle
[steps in the poo and looks at his shoe] Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!
Jimbo's lodge. This is where Huntin' and Killin' is shot. Inside, Jimbo is watching TV and Ned, in a short kimono, looks for something.
Announcer
Look at this sword. Only on House Shopping Network. It has a dragon on the blade. [close-up of the samurai sword] It's got a dragon painted right on the blade! You should buy the samurai sw-
Jimbo
Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?! [Ned tries to speak] I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!
Ned
[eructing] Shut... up... Jimbo.
Jimbo
Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out.
Stan
[outside] I saw it this way!
Kyle
Over here!
Cartman
[trying to keep up] Come on, you guys!
The boys reach the lodge.
Jimbo
[opens the door] What the hell's goin' on?!
Stan
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
Jimbo
Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on! [goes in, and reappears with his gun. Ned follows him out the door] Where did it go?
Kyle
It just ran by here a second ago. [rustling is heard]
Jimbo
[cocks the shotgun] Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap! [all move slowly around a corner] Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. [turns it on and flashes it into the trap]
Creature
Ooba jaaga!
Jimbo
Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
Creature
Meesa gonna die? Wooo-wowoop!
Cartman
Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.
Kyle
[annoyed] It's stupid.
Jimbo
Well, let's kill it.
Cartman
[intervening] No! No. Don't.
Jimbo
Huh?
Cartman
I like it.
Kyle
You don't like anything, Cartman! [the creature is shaking from fright, and Cartman looks at it affectionately]
Jimbo
Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it.
South Park, the next day.
Jimbo
Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. [the crowd murmurs and the creature just stares out of the cage. His view is that of a fish lens]
Sheila
[walks up to it] Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. [three men with briefcases walk up]
FED
Mayor, we're from the Department of Interior.
Mayor
Ooh, yes. How are you?
DOI 1
[the one with black hair] Fine, just fine.
DOI 2
[the one with red hair] Fine, just fine.
DOI 3
[the one with brown hair] Fine.
Mayor
Right over here. [she shows them the creature and they stare in awe]
DOI 2
My God, McClanahan, do you believe it? [DOI 3 is just stunned]
Creature
Meesa needa Jakov. [raises its arms] Dwooooooo!
DOI 1
Mm-it's amazing.
Mayor
What?
DOI 1
Mayor, this is a jakovasaur. A live one has never been seen.
Mayor
Oh, neato.
DOI 2
Incredible. [turns to look at the Mayor] We know of this creature only from remains frozen in snow.
DOI 1
Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
Cartman
Wow! Cool!
Ned
[eructing] Is... there... re... ward... money? [the DOI agents look at him]
Jimbo
Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!
DOI 2
This one jakovasaur can mother an entire population of the animals.
Woman
Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope.
Woman 2
Hope.
Man
Yes, Hope.
Hope
Meesa name Junjun.
Stan
I think his name is Junjun.
Mayor
Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name!
DOI 1
Now we must find a safe place for it.
Mr. Garrison
I'll keep it at my house.
Mayor
No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!
Junjun
Uuh?!
Mr. Garrison
What?! How dare you say that?!
Mayor
Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut.
Rancher
Oh, I got a barn it can stay in. It ain't much, but it's heated.
DOI 1
Well, that sounds fine, just fine.
DOI 3
Fine, just fine.
DOI 2
Fine.
Mr. Garrison
Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon? [everyone around him raises his or her hand] Oh, whatever!
That night, something mysterious is happening at Stark's Pond. The water is agitated again, and another jakovasaur rises out of the water. It sees a pup tent and rushes to it. It finds a backpack next to it and searches it. The following address shows up: E. Cartman, 21208 E. Bonaza Cir., South Park, CO. But Cartman is at home looking at the House Shopping Network on TV.
Announcer
It's got a dragon painted on the blade. This is the Sumatomi sword-
Cartman
[wondering] Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??
Liane
[from somewhere else] I'll think about it, hon.
Cartman
Sweet. [someone knocks on the front door] Mom, somebody's at the door.
Liane
Mommy's busy, boopie-kins.
Cartman
Should I get it?
Liane
[in bed, with torch and bong in hand] Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends.
Cartman
Okay.
Liane
[inhales, with a manly voice] Hmmm. [two men are in bed with her. One of them is her congressman, O'Reilly]
The knocking continues.
Cartman
Okay, okay, hold your horses! God! [opens the door and screams. An angry jakovasaur glares at him. Cartman backs into the living room] Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!
Liane
That's nice, muffin.
Jakovasaur
Please help me. Whoa-oh-oh-oh. [falls on his face and gets up] Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick.
Cartman
You mean the other jakovasaur?
Jakovasaur
What means a jakovasaur?
Cartman
You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
Jakovasaur
Oh. Cool beans.
Cartman
But the other jakovasaur talked different.
Jakovasaur
That's 'cause Junjun's a girl. Girls talk different.
Cartman
I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
Jakovasaur
Please take me to Junjun. We're the last of our kind. There are only two of us left.
Cartman's room. He's telling his friends what he learned.
Cartman
He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. [the others stay silent, looking at him]
Kyle
Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
Cartman
Will you stop with the whole "mom smoking crack" thing?! It's a old joke!
Jakovasaur
[hidden] Eric, do you have any more cookies? [Cartman turns his head aside and grins]
Stan
Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
Cartman
No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. [the closet door opens and the jakovasaur comes out]
Stan
Wow!
Cartman
Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.
Jakov
Huhello, guys. I love new friends. [trips and flies across the room, then clears his head. A rattling noise is heard]
Cartman
Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?
Stan
[put off] No, he's annoying.
Kyle
What are we supposed to do with him?
Cartman
We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
Stan
Why don't we just tell our parents?
Cartman
No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
The rancher's barn, that same night. The boys break into the barn with Jakov.
Stan
[softly] Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here.
Jakov
[sees his mate and can't help it] Junjun!
Stan
[softly, curtly] Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!
Jakov
[rushes up to her] Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay! [she's sitting on some hay]
Kyle
[softly, curtly] Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!
Jakov
[turns around] I am whispering! [steps on a rake, whose handle smacks him on the head] Yyeow!
Cartman
[laughing] Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.
Jakov
[soothing his head] I am?
Stan
Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
Jakov
Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond. [the barn doors open to show the Mayor, the rancher, and the DOI agents looking quite angry.]
Junjun
Aw, we's in big doodoo now.
Jakov
Uh oh.
Jimbo's lodge, daytime. Ned is on the phone.
Operator
Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?
Ned
[eructing] Yes... Hello..., um..., I... lost... my... voice... box…
Amanda
Excuse me?
Ned
I... lost... my... voice... box…
Amanda
[after a long pause] Excuse me?
Ned
[faster, after a pause] I... lost... my... voice... box... [Jimbo enters the room and Ned hangs up]
Jimbo
Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box! [Ned reaches for it, but Jimbo keeps it out of reach, teasing Ned] You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go. [hands him the box] Well, try it out!
Ned
[crisply] Mmm. Aw, Jimbo, I can't thank you enough for the new voice box. Gmmm, now, what in the devil is this thing?
Jimbo
Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake.
Ned
Mmm-aw, what a bloody pickle this is! Did you keep the receipt, then?
Man
[barges in] You guys come quick! I've only just heard!
Jimbo
What? What is it?
Man
They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur! [silence]
Ned
Gmmm, blimey.
South Park Square. The Mayor stands on stage with the DOI agents and the two jakovasaurs as the townsfolk filter in. The boys stand in front of the steps on the left side of the stage.
Mayor
[on the mic] Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
DOI 1
Thank you, Mayor. [takes over] The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back.
Cartman
[reading his acceptance speech] "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."
Kyle
What are you doing, fatass?!
Cartman
I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. "Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."

...Hope and Jakov are the last of their kind. But with the help of the Mayor, we have implemented a plan to help them breed. We will give them a home and a fighting chance at survival.
Man
[amid much chatter] Yea for us!
Jakov
Thank you!
Mayor
And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!
Cartman
[walks to the podium and speaks] Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.
Man 2
Well, that's about it. Let's go.
Man 3
Yeah. [the crowd begins to disperse]
Cartman
You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me... [finds himself all alone in the square] Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!
The jakovasaurs' new home. Everyone involved in finding and caring for the jakovasaurs is there.
Jakov
Wow!! It's so pretty!
DOI 1
Well, Jakov, we hope this new home "inspires" you and Hope to uh, hm, you know... [the room falls silent]
Jakov
What?
DOI 2
Well, we'd love to see more jakovasaurs, so, maybe you two should uuh…
Jakov
What?
DOI 3
Get to some business. [make a ring with the thumb and index finger of one hand and sticks the other index finger through the ring]
Jakov
[scratches his head] What??
Kyle
They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!
Jakov
Ooohh.
Mayor
[as the rest leave the house] We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone.
Jakov
Well, all right, then. [the Mayor closes the door]
The jakovasaurs have no idea what to do, so they don't do anything. Outside, the boys, the agents, the Mayor, the rancher, and Jimbo wait for something to happen. Sure enough, things are heard falling inside. Jakov is heard moaning and yelling as he stumbles around. Junjun runs out of the house and Jakov stands at the entrance.
Junjun
Meesa just don't wanna!
Jakov
[walking out] I don't know what to do!
DOI 1
Jakov, to have sex, all you need to do is, well, you know, put your... [sees there's nothing where something should be] Hmmm. [stroke his chin] I guess we don't know exactly how jakovasaurs mate.
DOI 2
[holds his index finger up] There is... another option.
Mephesto's ranch. The boys, the agents, and the Mayor are present with the jakovasaurs. Jakov and Junjun are on the examination table.
Mephesto
I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen.
Jakov
I have seamen? Where's their boat? [imitates a fog horn] Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr! [Cartman laughs]
Mephesto
Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov. [Jakov stops] I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked. [sticks a syringe into Junjun's arm and draws a blood sample. Junjun reacts immediately as Mephesto goes to his microscope]
Junjun
Oh-wwoooooop! Oh-wwoooooop!
Jakov
[adds his reaction] Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!
Stan
God-damn!
Kyle
Shut up!!
Mephesto
Yes! Yes, I think it worked! [Jakov and Junjun stop as Mephesto turns to face the group] You are going to be parents!
DOI 3
Yeah!
DOI 2
We did it!
Jakov
Now I can be like all the other guys in South Park!
Stan
[to Kyle] Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
The Marsh house. A football game is heard inside. Next, several men are behind or sitting on the sofa. Seated are Randy, Gerald, and Stuart, and behind are Chef, Mr. Mackey, and Mr. Garrison. Jakov is seated next to them on a folding chair. Jakov will now know what it is to be one of the guys.
Commentator
...and Bubby Brister is having a great first quarter! Let's see what trickery he uses here. Here's the snap, and he's down-
Jakov
Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys!
Randy
No problem, Jakov.
Commentator
To the 40-yard line!
Men
Yea!
Jakov
Go Niners! Ni-ners!
Gerald
We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!
Jakov
Oooops!
Commentator
...to Terrell Davis! He's at the 50, the 40, the 30,... [the men are happy]
Jakov
You guys know what? [they angrily snap their heads in his directions] This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit-
Commentator
He breaks another tackle, and the ball is loose!
Jakov
You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.
Randy
Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?
Jakov
Sure. You got money?
Gerald
[hands him some bills] Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
Jakov
[gets up] Cool beans. [trips over the plug, knocking down the TV] Oopsie. I'll be right back. [closes the door]
Mr. Mackey
Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay.
The Others
Yup.
The house of the jakovasaurs. The boys, the agents, Jimbo, Mephesto, the Mayor, and Sheila are all present.
DOI 1
Amazing! The gestation period was only four days.
DOI 2
At that rate, we could repopulate the jakovasaurs in just a few years.
Junjun
Doe-wooop!
DOI 1
Don't worry, Hope. Everything's gonna be fine, just fine.
DOI 3
Just fine.
DOI 2
Fine.
Kyle
Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
Cartman
If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.
Kyle
Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. [he and Stan laugh]
Cartman
Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!
DOI 2
Here we go.
Junjun
Doe-woooop!
Sheila
[gushing] Behold, the miracle of childbirth!
Junjun
Dowoop! [her water breaks and lands on everyone]
Kyle
Gross!
Junjun
Dowoop! [a baby jakovasaur is shot out and strikes the wall. It whimpers as it drops]
All
Hooray!
DOI 3
This is the first step in bringing the species back from the brink of extinction! [the baby jakovasaur gets up and moves around, growling]
Junjun
Dowoooop! Dowoop!
DOI 2
Looks like there might be a second one.
DOI 1
Wow! That would be a great start for them. [close-up of the second baby flying out of the vagina]
All
Hooray! [Junjun starts pumping babies out in all directions. The adults crouch behind the sofa for cover]
Mayor
She's a cannon! [seventeen babies end up in front of the wall. The lead agent walks up to them]
DOI 1
Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters.
Cartman
[picks up a baby and says sweetly] Aren't they cute, you guys?
Stan
[to Kyle] Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
Junjun
Huh-owhoa-o-woop! [pumps out a second set of jakovasaurs]
DOI 1
Huh?! [getting out of the way] Whoa-o-whoa!
South Park Elementary, Garrison's class. Class is now in session.
Mr. Garrison
Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. [the class is full of jakovasaur children]
Stan
Dude, it's crowded in here.
Jakovasaur Boy
[sitting in front of Pip] I like school!
Jakovasaur Girl
Bo-woop!
Mr. Garrison
O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history. [starts writing on the board] Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972? [a jakovasaur kid in the front row raises his hand and waves it] Yes?
Jakovasaur Boy
I don't know.
Jakovasaur Girl
Bo-woop!
Mr. Garrison
O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?
Jakovasaur Kid 1
[in front of Wendy] I can't.
Jakovasaur Kid 2
Me neither.
Mr. Garrison
[angrily] Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!
Jakovasaur Kid 2
Oh.
Jakovasaur Kid 3
O-wowo-oop! O-woo-oop!
Jakovasaur Kid 4
Ooo! Fight! Fight! [he and another jakovasaur start to fight]
Jakovasaur Kid 5
School, school! I like school! [the fighting escalates]

Jakovasaurs
School, school! I like school!

School, school! I like school!

Kyle
Dude, this sucks ass!
Cartman
["School, school! I like school!"] I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool. ["School, school! I like school!"]
Mr. Hat
This is insane, Mr. Garrison. ["School, school! I like school!"]
Mr. Garrison
[looking defeated] It sure is, Mr. Hat. ["School, school! I like-!"]
The bar, that night. Many of the town's adults are inside chatting away, including the Mayor.
Mayor
Now, folks, I know we're all a little worried about the jakovasaurs, and I want to hear you all out!
Mr. Garrison
Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything!
All
Yeah!
Chef
And those jakovasaur eat three times as much as normal children! I can't keep up!
All
Yeah!
Man
Totally!
Trashman
And they're creating more trash than we can handle, too!
Man
Totally!
All
Yeah!
Man
Listen to her!
Man 2
And what about little Laura, the Williams' kid? If she doesn't get that heart-valve operation, she could die. [no one responds, so he supports himself] Yeah! Yeah, that's right!
Mayor
All right, all right. It's obvious we have to do something, but we can't just make them leave.
Jimbo
We just encourage them to find someplace better.
Mayor
But where? Jakovasaurs are big, loud, annoying, and stupid. Where would they fit in?
The house of the jakovasaurs, next day. The Mayor and others are talking to Jakov and Junjun
Jakov
Memphis?
Mayor
Yes, Memphis. [shows him a brochure of the city] You jakovasaurs would love it there.
Jakov
I don't know. I like South Park a lot. What do you think, honey?
Junjun
G'ooh-woo-ooop!
Jakov
Yeah.
Mayor
But everyone in South Park wishes they could live in Memphis. Right? [several people respond with "Yeah" and "Memphis"]
Jakov
Okay, we'll move to Memphis!
Men
Yea!
Others
Hooray! [the door opens, and the boys appear with Liane]
Cartman
[cheerfully] Hey, Jakov, how's it going?
Jakov
Great, Eric! We're moving.
Cartman
[gasps] Moving?
Jakov
Me, Jun and the family are heading to the Promised Land of Memphis.
Cartman
You... can't leave. You're my friend.
Liane
Oh, Eric dear. It's what's best.
Jimbo
Yeah. Let's get that luggage packed!
Cartman
[softly] Jakov, please don't go. [music] You make everything in South Park fun. [Jakov is touched] You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.
Jakov
It would?
Cartman
Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?
Jakov
O-kay. I like South Park best of all. We're staying!
Cartman
[exulting] Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys! [everyone else is pissed at him]
Outside. Everyone leaves the house disappointed.
Mayor
Now what do we do?
DOI 1
Don't worry, We've come up with a plan.
Mayor
You have?
DOI 1
Yes. We're leaving.
All
What??
DOI 1
We're getting the hell out of here and away from those God-damned things.
Mayor
You can't leave.
Cartman
Yes. Who would take care of them?
DOI 2
Little boy, we're making you an honorary Department of Interior person. [gives him a DOI badge] So now, you are officially in charge of South Park's fish and wildlife. You have authority over all of them.
Cartman
[a bit humbly] I have authoriteh?
DOI 2
That's right. And people must respect it.
Cartman
[fitting into the role] Well, that should be fine, just fine. [the agents climb into their van]
DOI 2
Fine, just fine.
Cartman
Fine.
Stan
Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
DOI 2
Bye-bye, now. [closes the door, and the van speeds away. Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]
The Jakovasaurs' house, later that week.
Announcer
And now back to... Jakovasaurs! on Comedy Central. ["Jakovasaurs" appears on screen. Then, Junjun appears in the living room with some of her children.]
Jakov
[enters wearing a fedora and carrying a briefcase] Hi, honey! I'm home! [trips over the welcome mat and crashes into the sofa. Canned laughter is heard] Wooooo! [gets up, rubbing his head] Boy, it was rough at work today. I've never seen so much coffee.
Junjun
Booo-wooop?
Jakov
No, in the boss's lap. [more laughter]
Boy
Hello, dad.
Jakov
Hello, son. How was your day?
Boy
Oh, not so good. Something really strange happened.
Jakov
What? You mean MTV played a video that wasn't Will Smith? [more laughter]
Boy
Noho, dad. A man in a blue suit and a bag came to the door. He just left this li'l piece of paper with a stamp on it. [brings out the letter]
Jakov
That's called a mailman. He takes care of mail.
Boy
Oh! He took care of mom, too. [more laughter]
Jakov
You're a nut! Let me see that letter. [opens it and reads the letter] It's from a game show. The Mayor has invited me to compete. [the front door opens]
Cartman
Hi, Jakov. [applause] What the hell is that? [laughter] Who's laughing?
Jakov
Eric! The Mayor has invited us to compete on a game show in South Park! Big prizes, an all-expense paid vacation-
Cartman
Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. [he and Jakov start walking]
Jakov
Woo, woo! [trips over one of his kids and falls on his back. Cartman stops. Jakov gets up. He and Cartman face the camera as laughter and applause are heard, and grin.]
While Cartman visits Jakov, the other boys are in the Mayor's office with several townsfolk. Liane is there, too.
Mayor
[anxious] Come onn, come on! [the phone rings and she snatches the receiver] Hello!
Jakov
Mayor? This is Jakov. I'm the tall fellow down the block from-
Mayor
Yes. Yes, Jakov. You're calling about the game show. Congratulations! Will you do it?!
Jakov
Sure! If a free trip is involved, can my whole family go?
Mayo
[rushing] Of course! That's the point! Just be ready this afternoon at the public access building, and good luck! Hope you win!! [thrusts the receiver to arm's length]
Jakov
Cool beans!! [the Mayor hangs up]
Mayor
We've got 'em! All right. The boys here will keep little Eric Cartman distracted. Meanwhile, we get rid of the jakovasaurs and bring some normalcy back to this town! Ready?
All
Break!
South Park Public Access. The Mayor is hosting her own game show this afternoon. To her right is Jakov, to her left Officer Barbrady. Jakovasaurs cheer in the first two rows in the studio audience. Jimbo approaches Ned.
Jimbo
Hey, Ned! A package came for you today from Voice Box Express.
Ned
[eructing] Oh... boy..., oh... boy.
Mayor
[whispering in Barbrady's ear] Now remember, Barbrady, all you have to do is lose!
Barbrady
Right.
Mayor
[goes back to her mark] Okay. Let's quiet down, people and jakovasaurs! [turns on the mic] Now, as you know, the winner of this little game will get an all-expense paid trip for himself and fifty of his closest relatives to lovely France! [the jakovasaurs hoot and holler] And, all one of you lucky contestants has to do is answer only one of these questions! Are you ready, players?
Barbrady
Ready.
Jakov
Ready.
Mayor
Okay. Hands on your buzzers.
Jakov
[bzt] Forty-seven! [his kids cheer wildly]
Mayor
[correcting Jakov] You have to wait until I ask the question first.
Jakov
Sor-ry!
Mayor
That's okay. Hands on buzzers.
Jakov
[bzt] Turkey sandwich!
Barbrady
Damn, he's quick!
Jakov
[bzt] Oh. Sor-ry! [bzt]
Barbrady
No, I'm sorry. [bzzzt]
Jakov
[Bzzzzzzzzt] No, it's my fault. I'm sorry.
Barbrady
[Bzzzzzzzzt] No, it's all me. Uh, my bad.
Jakov
Sorry.
Barbrady
Sorry. [both buzzers stay on]
Mayor
Will somebody please unplug the God-damned buzzers?! [the buzzers stop]
Stagehand
[off camera] Got it!
Mayor
Now, can we get on with this? First question: What color is blue? [drumroll]
Barbrady
Blue? [ping. Barbrady gets the first point]
Mayor
What?
Barbrady
Uh. Blue is blue?
Jakov
Awww, did I lose?
Mayor
What? Blue is-? Nono. Hang on. [whispers to Barbrady] You're supposed to lose, you idiot!
Barbrady
Where am I?
Mayor
Just don't answer any more questions, got it?
Barbrady
Okie-dokie.
Mayor
Sorry, folks, a little mix-up. We're playing best out of three!
The woods. Stan and Kyle lead Cartman along. Cartman is in uniform.
Cartman
What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.
Stan
Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.
Kyle
We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
Cartman
Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species. [brings it out] Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.
Kyle
[pointing] There it is! [a shot of Kenny wearing twigs] That must be of the antelope family.
Cartman
[after some study] That's Kenny with branches on his head. [looks again] Why did you bring me all the way out here, you guys?
Stan
[huffs] Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
Cartman
Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! [drops his notepad and rushes back to town]
Kyle
Cartman! Wait!
Kenny
(Hey you guys, wait up for me!) [a black bear rushes down the hill, growling] (Waaah!) [the bear mauls him and tumbles away]
South Park Public Access. The game show continues. Barbrady is ahead 7-0.
Mayor
What's two plus two, Jakov?
Jakov
I don't know!
Barbrady
Four? [ping. 8-0]
Mayor
Jakov, what is your name? [drumroll. The studio audience looks at him quite annoyed]
Barbrady
Jakov [ping. 9-0]
Mayor
Oh, screw it. Jakov wins! [raises his hand in victory]
Jakov
I do? [his kids rejoice]
Mayor
You and your entire family are going to wonderful and exotic France!
Jakov
Hooray!
Mayor
All right, everybody. Let's get them to the airport! [members of the studio audience start carrying out little jakovasaurs] Let's go, people! There's no time to lose! [two people carry Jakov out]
South Park Airport. The jakovasaurs are being whisked into the plane as quickly as possible.
Jakov
[looking at Randy and Gerald] But what about our clothes? Shouldn't we pack first?
Randy
Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov.
Jakov
Oh yeah. Well, good-bye everybody! We'll send stuff from France!
Crowd
Good-bye!
Jakov
[almost trips as he turns to enter the plane] Werrr. [the crowd laughs weakly]
Cartman
[arriving and running up the stairs] Jakov!
Jimbo
Close the door! [an attendant closes the door on Cartman's face]
Cartman
[pounding] Open this door!
Liane
Eric, this is for the best.
Cartman
[facing the crowd angrily] I am Department of Interior guy, and I have authoritah! [the plane backs into the runway, then moves forward. Cartman rushes down the steps and runs alongside the plane] No! Jakov, don't go!
Jakov
[from his window] Hi, Eric! Okay, bye, then! [the plane takes off. Cartman can only watch as the plane disappears in the horizon]
Cartman
[resigned] Come... back. [the crowd begins to surround him.]
Liane
[reaching out] Eric, it's important for you to understand-.
Cartman
Don't, mother! Just, don't.
Mayor
[on one knee] I know it's hard, Eric, but I've learned something today. You see, animal species come and go. It's all a part of natural evolution.
Jimbo
The jakovasaurs would have gone extinct if we hadn't interfered. Because their particular form of life simply wasn't practical.
Ned
[with a much better voice box] We can't go around saving every form of life, any more than we can kill them all. We have to let nature run its course. [silence]
Jimbo
Mhmm Ned, that voice box sucks!
Ned
I know. I'm still trying to find my old one.
Mayor
Well, then. What say we all go get some ice cream!
Crowd
Hooray!
Cartman
No. That's okay. I'll see you guys. [slowly walks away]
Kyle
Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
Stan
Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
The Café Grenouille in Paris, France. The Eiffel Tower in in the background. An accordionist plays.
Waiter
Bonjour.
Woman
[blonde wearing stylish shades] Bonjour.
Waiter
Café?
Woman
Oui. [a bus pulls up and drops off passengers, then pulls away]
Jakov
[with his family] Come on, kids! Let's go find some pyramids! [crashes into a table and ends up in its umbrella on the ground] Woops! Aaaah! [The accordionist stops and everyone stares at Jakov. Then they start laughing]
Man
[one of two in suits] C'est drôle et amusant (That was SO FUNNY!!) [chuckles]
Accordionist
(I love its antics!!!)
Blonde
Il est si comme Jerry Lewis!!! (He's just like Jerry Lewis!!!) [the laughter continues]
End of Jakovasaurs

Tweek vs. Craig
South Park Elementary. The school bell rings. Most of the third-grade boys are in a shop room.
Mr. Adler
[sets the picture down] Huh? Oh, uh, I was just saying that I want to know who is the biggest troublemaker in your class?
Stan
[quickly points] Tweek is!
Tweek
Arrh! No, I'm not!
Kyle
Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble.
Tweek
Arrrrh!
Cartman
Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
Mr. Adler
That true, Craig? You a troublemaker?
Craig
No.
Mr. Adler
Well, you'd better not be, because in shop class we- [Craig flips him off] Hey! Did you just flip me off?!
Craig
No.
Mr. Adler
Yes, you did!
Cartman
Told ya!
Kyle
[hushed, to Stan] Dude, shop class sucks. Maybe we should have taken home ec.
Stan
Now way, dude. Home ec is for girls.
The Home Economics room. All the girls are here.
Voice
[female] Welcome to home ec. [the camera scans across the class] For the next week, you will be learning how to bake, sew, clean, and make things that are lacy and pretty. [Kenny appears]
Kenny
(Woohooo!) [Wendy raises her hand]
Wendy
I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.
Woman
That's right, Wendy. You see, some of you girls will go on to have interesting jobs and careers. [now cautioning] But all of you pretty ones... won't have to worry about that, because you can marry a nice man. And that's why we have... home ec.
Kenny
(Woohooo!) [the girls on either side of him look at him]
The Shop room. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit before a power miter box. Cartman is feeding it wood.
Cartman
I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? [cuts out two slabs]
Stan
I don't know. He's such a wuss.
Mr. Adler
[passing by] Hey! Don't screw around! You screw around too much!
Cartman
You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. [Craig leafs through some wood scraps, and Tweek approaches a belt sander on the floor]
Stan
No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
Cartman
Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
Kyle
Do you wanna bet?
Cartman
Yeah, I'll bet.
Stan
How much?
Cartman
Five bucks.
Stan
You're on!
Tweek
[revs up a belt sander.] Arrh! [jumps. Stan and Kyle walk to him]
Stan
Hey Tweek.
Tweek
[jumps] Gaarhrhrh!
Stan
Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
Tweek
[drops the sander] He does?
Stan
Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
Tweek
Why?
Kyle
Dude, because! You have to stand up for yourself! So will you fight him? [Craig is still leafing through the scraps]
Tweek
[jumps] Rrrrh! He doesn't look like he wants to fight me.
Cartman
Craig, could I talk to you real quick? [Craig flips him off, and Cartman puts his palms up to calm him] Er, just a second, please, Craig. Craig, I'm not normally one to get involved in this kind of thing but, well, I was just standing over by Tweek, and, he called you a big poop-eater.
Craig
He did?
Cartman
Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
Craig
Why would he say that?
Cartman
I don't know, Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
Craig
[now pissed] Well, I've gotta go over there and-
Cartman
[blocks his way] No, no! Craig, you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
Craig
Okay. [flips Tweek off]
Kyle
There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
Tweek
[twitches to one side] Rrrr! What a jerk!
Stan
He's really got it out for you, dude.
Tweek
Why?! What did I do?!
Kyle
So, do you agree to fight him after school?
Tweek
I guess so.
Stan
Super. See you there. [they walk away, pleased]
Mr. Adler takes out the picture of his fiancée again and looks at it. He begins to daydream. Memories of his fiancée come to him, and her voice echoes every time reminisces.
Fiancée
[runs from him] Catch me, Richard. [she laughs even after he catches her and she's on the grass] I'm so in love with you, Richard. [next scene: she's in the kitchen holding a tray] I made you some cookies, Richard. [sniffs them real good. Next, she's by the fireplace with a little stocking] Merry Christmas, Richard. [laughing on the yard outside] Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. [in flight, trying to regain control] Aaaaaaa! [in a swimming pool, under water] Richard!
The school bell rings, and Mr. Adler snaps out of the daydream.
Mr. Adler
Aaaarr! Uh. [opens a drawer to get some nicotine gum, and chews some] Oh why? Why? [closes his eyes and continues chewing]
Stan
Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
Mr. Adler
[opens his eyes] Huh? Stop screwing around!
Stan
The bell rang. Can we go?
Mr. Adler
Well, uh, well, sure. Uh, class dismissed.
Stan
Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Cartman follow him out.]
The school yard.
Stan
This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
Cartman
You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
Kyle
We'll see!
Cartman
Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
Stan
You're on, fatass! [Kenny shows up]
Cartman
Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
Kenny
(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)
Stan
How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
Kyle
Yeah. That's not cool, dude. [the girls walk by]
Bebe
Bye, Kenny. See you tomorrow.
Annie
Bye, Kenny.
Kenny
(Bye, ladies.) [the other boys arrive as the girls leave]
Clyde
Hey, what's going on?
Kyle
Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
Clyde
Really? Cool. [the boys stand around waiting] It's funny, 'cause Tweek and Craig both went home about fifteen minutes ago.
Kyle
What?
Token
Yeah, they left.
Stan
Aw, hell!
Cartman
Those sons of bitches!
Clyde
I guess they don't wanna fight.
Kyle
Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! [walks off with Stan, Cartman, and Kenny]
Stan and Kyle arrive at Tweek's house. Stan rings the bell.
Stan
Tweek?
Kyle
[looks up to the second floor] Tweek?
Tweek
[opens the center window] Arrh! What do you guys want?
Stan
How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
Tweek
Craig and I have no reason to fight each other.
Kyle
Well, Craig showed up.
Tweek
He did?
Stan
Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, "Man, Tweek's a wuss," and we were all like, "No he's not, Craig," and he was all like, "Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!"
Tweek
I don't have crooked teeth!
Kyle
And then Craig was all like, "Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken." And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken; [Stan watches as Kyle demonstrates] well, everybody in the world saw it!
Tweek
Everyone in the world?! Rrrr! [falls down behind the window]
Stan
Yeah, it was weak.
Tweek
I'm not a chicken!
Kyle
Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. [turns to walk away]
Tweek
[pops up] Wait! I'll fight!
Stan
Tomorrow?
Tweek
Okay.
Cartman and Kenny arrive at Craig's house. Cartman knocks and Craig answers.
Cartman
Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
Craig
Red Racer's on.
Cartman
Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
Craig
I do watch Red Racer every day of the week!
Cartman
[aloof] Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
Craig
Nope. [shuts the door]
Cartman
[hushed] Egh. God damn it! [knocks again, and Craig answers] Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
Craig
What?! What did he say about Stripe?!
Cartman
Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
Craig
That son of a bitch, I'll kill him!
Cartman
Yeah, I'd be pissed too, so maybe we should reschedule the fight for tomorrow?
Craig
After Red Racer.
Cartman
[being gracious] After Red Racer, of course.
The Tweek house, that night, dinner. The Tweaks are at table.
Richard Tweak
How was school today, son?
Tweek
Errh!
Richard Tweak
That's great.
Tweek
Dahad, if some kid in school wants to fight me, what should I do??
Richard Tweak
Son, let me tell you a little story about when your mother and I first met. [gets up and stands next to her. Peaceful music plays] You see, a long time ago, there were a lot of guys who were after your mother. She used to be very attractive.
Mrs. Tweak
It's true. I was. [Tweek bobs as he listens]
Richard Tweak
Well, when I started courting your mother, there was this big muscular football player named Quib, who didn't take too kindly to me. He wanted your mother all to himself. And so, one day, he challenged me to a fight. [sits down, and both parent resume eating. Tweek waits for the rest of the story.]
Tweek
[after a long lull] Well?
Mrs. Tweak
Well what, honey?
Tweek
Nrr. What happened?
Richard
Oh'd. I, I don't know. He moved away or something.
Mrs. Tweak
Yes, I think that's right.
Tweek
Rrrrr! You guys never help me! [the parents look at each other, and Tweek starts banging his head against the table] Your stories never go anywhere! I hate it! I want out! I want out! [the parents resume eating]
Craig's house, dinner time. Craig has a little sister.
Craig
Dad, I'm supposed to get in a fight tomorrow.
Thomas Tucker
With who?
Craig
Some kid.
Thomas
Oh.
Laura Tucker
Don't just "Oh" him, Thomas!
Craig
Yeah, don't just "Oh" me!
Thomas
I'll "Oh" whoever I want! [Mrs. Tucker flips Thomas off, he flips back, the daughter flips them both off, and Craig flips his dad off with the right hand, his sister off with the left, and his mom with the right, up close.]
Mr. Adler's home. He and a woman have just returned from a date.
Mr. Adler
Well, that was fun, Pearl. See you later.
Pearl
Richard, aren't you going to invite me in?
Mr. Adler
Why?
Pearl
Well, I thought maybe you would at least at-tempt to make love to me tonight.
Mr. Adler
Oh, well, uuh, I can't. I left the oven on.
Pearl
Oh, Richard, why can't you open your heart to me? Why?
Mr. Adler
I just... I can't. Oh, I know. I have genital warts. [he begins closing the door]
Pearl
We'll use plastic wrap.
Mr. Adler
Nope. Sorry. Maybe some other time. [shuts the door on her face. He holds the door in place, then makes his way to a picture of his deceased love, picks it up, and remembers...]
Fiancée
[on a swing] Swing me Richard, swing me higher. I wanna touch the sky, Richard. [now in a gazebo] Richard, I'm here! [waves him over] Smile. [now opens a little box and sees a ring] Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! It's what I do! [in flight, trying to regain control] Aaaaaaa! [in a swimming pool, under water] Richard! [now rising from an open coffin] Richard.
Mr. Adler
[returns] Haaarrr! [opens a small drawer in the side table, gets some nicotine gum, and starts chewing, then mumbles] Aw, God, what am I gonna do? [resumes chewing]
South Park Elementary, the cafeteria, next day, recess. From left to right on a table are seated Stan, Tweek, Kyle, Cartman, Craig, and Kenny. Much of the class is assembled before them. A large sign saying "Tweek VS. Craig" hangs above them from the ceiling.
Stan
Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
Clyde
Uh, how long do you expect the fight to last?
Crai
I uh...
Cartman
[covers Craig's mouth] However long Craig wants it to last. [the kids laugh] T'heh, ub. Look, make no mistake. Craig has been ready for this fight since day one. He doesn't even view it as a challenge.
Kyle
He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
Cartman
Hup. Did you hear that? It sound like some diarrhea coming out of someone's mouth or something.
Kyle
Shut up, fatass!!
Cartman
Don't call me fat, you son of a bitch! [jumps on him, and they start fighting. Kenny and Stan soon join in, leaving Tweek and Craig looking at them]
Clyde
Wow. Tweek and Craig really hate each other, huh? This should be a good fight.
Home Economics, after recess.
Pearl
[stands by a chart equating shoes with money] On your first date, look at the man's shoes. Sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes. [Kenny and the girls take notes. Pearl then stands by the chalkboard listing the number of credit cards from 1 to 4] When he takes you out to dinner, try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you. If he only has one credit card, BEWARE. [crosses 1 out] It means he doesn't spend a lot, and worse yet, it could be a debit card. If he has more than four credit cards, that's a little fishy. [crosses 4 out] The perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is... two. [circles it. Bebe raises her hand]
Bebe
What if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer, but is still getting his degree?
Pearl
Dump that zero and get yourself a hero! He could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats. [the girls and Kenny just look at her]
Shop class. The boys are busy on various projects. Cartman stands on a stool operating a drill press as Stan and Kyle stand on the floor.
Cartman
When I have your guys' ten bucks, I'm gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen TV in the whole world.
Kyle
That's more than ten bucks, you stupid fatass!
Cartman
Well, if I get ten buck from each of you, that's like $2000.
Mr. Adler
Hey, quit screwing around back there! You're horsing! [He now hears a voice calling to him, from the drawers in his desk...]
Fiancée
Ri-chard! [he whistles] Ri-chard! [he remembers mumbling something in return, and pulls out her picture. He dreams: she is back on the swing] Swing me Richard, swing me higher![now in a gazebo] Richard, I'm here! [waves him over. Cut to her opening a little box] Oh, Richard, it's beautiful. Yes. Yes. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'll pilot! [in the cockpit, she calls out] It's all for you! [an alarm sounds, and the gas tank explodes behind her] Aaaaaaa! [she tries to land the plane right, but it falls into a swimming pool. She's thrown clear, into the water] Richard!
Clyde
Mr. Adler. Mr. Adler!
Mr. Adler
[returns] Huh? Uh, what?
Clyde
Tommy stuck his face in the belt sander [Tommy comes and stands beside Clyde. There are no features on his face.]
Mr. Adler
The belt sander? Tommy?? I told you not to screw around with the belt sander, didn't I? [Clyde looks at Tommy for a reaction, but...] Well go on. Go see the nurse; she'll give you some peroxide. [Tommy walks away in the wrong direction]
Clyde
[noticing the picture and points] What's that?
Mr. Adler
Huh? Oh, this is a woman I knew a long time ago.
Clyde
What? She die or something?
Mr. Adler
What? Hey! Go on! [upset, he puts the picture away] You're screwing around in here! [Clyde hurries away]
After school. The kids climb over a hill to reach the tetherball pole. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek lead the way
Clyde
Oh boy! Here we go!
Wendy
[joins the group] What's happening?
Kyle
Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
Wendy
Oh cool!
Stan
Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed. [the two groups meet] All right. Here we go.
Kyle
Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
Cartman
You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
Kyle
No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. [Craig and Tweek look at each other, but nothing happens]
Stan
Well?
Cartman
Come on!
Wendy
Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!
Craig
[turns to the crowd] What do we do?
Stan
Huh?
Cartman
What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
Tweek
How?
Kyle
How??
Craig
I've never been in a fight before.
Tweek
Me neither.
Crowd
[let down] Awwww.
Stan
[in disgust] Aw, dude, come on!!
Cartman
You just hit each other, smack each other around. [Tweek slaps Craig, and Craig slaps Tweek. No effect]
Kyle
[sighs] Not like that!
Tweek
Like what, then?
Stan
[approaches the fighters] All right, all right, screw it! We have to postpone the fight 'til Tweek and Craig can learn how to fight.
Crowd
Awww. [disperses]
Clyde
[to Wendy] All that build-up for nothing.
Wendy
Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!
Stan
All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
Cartman
I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
Stan
Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
Cartman
[faking fear] Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys! [serious] I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
Stan
Fine! We'll see you back here tomorrow!
Cartman
Fine! [the parties part ways]
Kyle
Fine!
Cartman
Fine, that's fine!
Big's Gym, later. This is where Stan and Kyle took Jesus to learn to box. On this occasion, Stan and Kyle bring Tweek. Jimbo is the coach, Ned the sparring partner. All are in the ring
Jimbo
Alrighty. Tweek, my little nephew Stanley has asked me to teach you the fine points of boxing.
Tweek
Rrrrh!
Jimbo
You're in luck! Ned here used to be the state champion until a grenade blew his arm off.
Ned
Mmrr I can still kick ass.
Jimbo
Now, Tweek, boxing is a Man sport. There is nothing in the world more Man than boxing. It is Man at his most Man. So when you spar with Ned here, just dig deep into that most Man part of you.
Tweek
Hwaaah! [Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]
Jimbo
Well, enough of the lectures. let's get to boxing. [rings the bell, and Ned sends Tweek to the ropes with one punch]
Tweek
Uugh!
Ned
Mmm whatcha got, bee-ahtch? [Tweek gets up]
Jimbo
Keep your guard up, Tweek! [Tweek does so. Ned punches him twice more, and Tweek falls]
Tweek
Ow!
Stan
Damn it!
Kyle
Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
Jimbo
All right, looks like we'll have to apply the Oppenheimer technique with Tweek here. [Tweek gets up]
Ned
[prancing] Gmmmmm, whatcha got, bee-ahtch?
Jimbo
Punch him in the balls, Tweek!! [Tweek lunges at Ned and lands the punch]
Ned
AAAAaaaarrgh.
Jimbo
Atta boy! Now quick, get him again while he's down! [Tweek lands a barrage of punches, and Ned groans after each punch]
Ned
Ow.
Jimbo
Good! Now kick his balls! [Tweek does so several times, and Ned groans] There, see? You've got him coughing up blood.
Stan, Kyle
Hooray!
Tweek
Rrrr!
Jimbo
Now THAT'S BOXING!
The Nishimura School of Martial Arts
Master
Your friend hasa brought you to learn the ancient art ofa sumo. You must learna discipline anda respect. [Craig flips him off] In sumo, your body must be rike a stone, and your mind rike a meatroaf.
Craig
Meatloaf?
Master
The object is simpry to push opponent out of circle. Is opponent ready?
Cartman
I'm ready! [comes out, speaks softly] Hey, I like this hair thing. This is cool. [stops to pull some salt out of a kettle and pats his hands together]
Master
Let us begin. [Cartman plants his feet] Ready? And, th-ree.
Cartman
Respect my authoritah! [he and Craig engage in pushing each other]
Master
Body rike a stone! Mind rike a meatroaf!
Cartman
[turns around to back Craig out of the ring] Dude. Come on, now. Come on.
Craig
Oh, Jesus! I can't take it! Stop!
Master
Fight back! Resist the ass!
Craig
How can I resist an ass so great?
Master
It is only an ass. You must overcome the ass with your mind.
Craig
This ass is unlike any I've encountered, Master. [Cartman bumps him off the ring, he hits a wall, and he's out]
Cartman
I win!
Master
There is indeed great power in your ass, Eric. Perhaps you should consider sumo as your profession.
Cartman
Hey, maybe. [plants his feet again]
Mr. Adler's house, night. He's asleep, and a bad dream begins
Mr. Adler
[twisting and turning] No. No. Make it stop.
Fiancée
[laughing on the yard outside] Oh, Richard. Say you'll hold me forever. [Now at a phone by a desk] But you have to come see me fly tomorrow, Richard. I have a surprise for you. [next day, next to a plane] Don't worry, Richard. I'm a pilot! [in the cockpit during flight] Watch me, Richard! [waves to him as she writes "I love U Richard." As she gets to the last letters, she loses control and the alarm comes on. Her gas tank explodes and she screams. She manages to write A's on her way down to a crash in the pool. She sinks and calls out] Richard!
Mr. Adler
Baaaaa! [looks around and then sobs] I never got to say good-bye. I never got to say good-bye! [reaches for some nicotine gum, only to find the box empty] Oh no! Oh NO! NOW what do I do?! [begins bawling]
South Park Elementary, next day. Home Ec.
Pearl
Okay, that was very good, class. Now let's try this one together. [holds up a board saying] Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?
Class
[including Kenny] Honey, can I get a new wardrobe?
Pearl
All right, now let's try this one together. [holds up a board saying] Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
Class
[including Kenny] Lisa Smith's husband just bought HER a new car....
Pearl
Good. Bebe, why don't you try this one. [holds up a board saying] I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
Bebe
I think a trip to Hawaii would really improve our sex life.
Pearl
Outstanding! Now, Kenny, how about you try? [holds up a board saying] I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed.
Kenny
(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
Pearl
[looks at him in dismay] O-kay. Kenny, could I talk to you over here real quick?
Kenny
(Sure you can.) [gets up and goes to her desk]
Pearl
Kenny, I don't know quite how to tell you this, but... I'm not sure home economics is right for you.
Kenny
(Why?)
Pearl
Well, your cooking is unsatisfactory, your sewing skills are below average, and, frankly, I don't think the odds of you marrying a nice rich man in the future are very, well, good.
Kenny
(You don't?)
Pearl
No. I think you should consider transferring to shop class.
Kenny
(Shop class?) [images of threatening tools tools fill his head: a drill, a torch, a belt sander, a table saw] (No, I won't!)
Pearl
Now, now. Very few students are severely injured in a shop class.
Kenny
(I don't wanna take shop class!) [draws his hood tight, and the bell rings]
Bebe
Come on! It's time for the fight!
Wendy
Yeah! [the girls begin to file out of class]
Pearl
Fight? Oh no no, girls! Haven't I taught you anything?
The playground, after school. The kids head for the tetherball pole. The fighters are present: Tweek wearing a boxing robe with hood, Craig in sumo gear
Stan
Okay, the time has finally come. [the other kids close in]
Clyde
[holding a box of] Programs, get your programs here. Programs.
Kyle
Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.
Tweek
Hrrr.
Kyle
This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
Tweek
Rrrr, mean, rrrr.
Cartman
The spirit of the dragon is in your hands. Hurshar kashurshar. Hurlong churshar. All right?
Craig
Okay.
Cartman
Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
Craig
Okay, okay!
Tweek is ready first, then Craig gets ready
Tweek
Rrrr! [Craig adjusts his own head] Hr. [Craig flips him off]
Stan
You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
Craig
Respect my authority.
Tweek lands some punches and Craig tries to throw Tweek off sumo-style. They go back and forth this way for a while
Stan, Kyle
Come on, Tweek!
Cartman
Come on, Craig!
The shop room. Mr. Adler is alone and starts to write
Mr. Adler
To whom it may concern: I can no longer live without her. I couldn't say goodbye to her, and so now I must say goodbye to all of you, for I am all out of nicotine gum.Sincerely yours,
Richard Adler
Shop Class
P.S. Don't screw around. You all screw around too much.

[he leaves the desk and goes to the table saw, turns on the switch, lies on the table feet first, and is pulled towards the blade]

Mr. Adler
Good-bye, cruel world. [sits up] Jesus Christ! What was I thinking?! That would have hurt like hell! [lie back down, now head first]
the playground. Craig and Tweek tumble towards the school, neither giving in. The other kids follow them to a clearing outside a bungalow, where Craig and Tweek resume trading punches
Stan
Ye-hah!
Cartman
Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! [the fighters, now tired and panting, butt heads]
Kyle
Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
Cartman
Come on, Craig!
Stan
Come on, Tweek! You got him!
Kyle
Get him! [the fighters just pant, stuck to each other] Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
Tweek
What?
Kyle
Craig just called you a boner!
Tweek
Rrrr! [punches Craig]
Kyle
[to Stan:] We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
Stan
Yeah.
Shop class. Mr. Adler draws closer to the saw blade and sighs. Kenny comes in and hands him Pearl's note.
Kenny
(Hi, Mr. Adler.)
Mr. Adler
What? Who are you? [takes the note and reads] "Kenny McCormick has been transferred from home ec to shop class." Well, all right. Get some safety goggles and start gettin' acquainted with the jigsaw over there. [hands him back the note and Kenny goes to the jigsaw] Hrh.
Outside the bungalow Craig and Tweek continue fighting. They lock up and tumble into the slide, tearing it down. They end up under the debris
Tweek
[gets up] Huh? [Craig pops up and tackles Tweek. The other kids, fearing the fight over, cheer again.]
Shop Class. Kenny starts cutting wood on the jigsaw, but looks at Mr. Adler going to his death. Craig and Tweek crash through the shop class window and continue fighting
Mr. Adler
[sits up] What the-? [the door opens and the other kids pour in]
Stan
Here they are.
Mr. Adler
[stands and walks towards the kids] Hey! What's going on?
Stan
Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. [trading punches]
Mr. Adler
Well, why the hell don't you stop them?
Cartman
'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
Mr. Adler
Don't screw aROUND!
[Craig and Tweek tumble towards Kenny]
Kenny
(Hey!) [They knock the stool out under him. He hangs on to the jigsaw table] (Hey!)
Mr. Adler
Stop screwin' aROUND!!
[Tweek slams Craig into a second jigsaw and both tumble into a tool cart, which falls onto the second jigsaw, which tumbles onto the one Kenny is on.]
Kenny
(Hey, God damn it!)
Mr. Adler
Eh. Hey, you're SCREWIN' AROUND TOO MUCH!! [Kenny gets stuck in the blade and spins around. He's finally thrown clear and ends up in a box of old nails. Some nails fly out of the box.]
Kenny
(Ugh!)
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Mr. Adler
[goes to the box of nails and plucks Kenny out] Well, don't just stand there, call an ambulance! [the boys just shrug] You see? You see what happens when you screw around in shop class?
Kenny
(I understand, dude.)
Mr. Adler
What? What's that, son?
Fiancée
[through Kenny] Richard.
Mr. Adler
AAaaagh! [settles down] No! No, please don't go. I need you. I can't live without you. [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Stan shrugs]
Fiancée
[visible now, where Kenny's face was] Richard, you have to move on. I want you to be happy.
Mr. Adler
But I can't. I never got a chance to say good-bye.
Fiancée
Then say it now, Richard.
Mr. Adler
Good-bye?
Fiancée
There. Now do you feel better?
Mr. Adler
No.
Fiancée
Of course you don't. Saying good-bye doesn't mean anything. It's the time that we spent together that really matters, not how we loved it.
Mr. Adler
You... you're right. You're right. [The fiancée leaves and an old woman takes her place. The background is blue.]
Woman
Richard, this is Grandma.
Mr. Adler
Gram'ma? Hi, Gram!
Gram'ma
You never said good-bye to me either. [she leaves and a man enters]
Man
Hey, Richard. Remember me?
Mr. Adler
Uncle Corey! Wow, you're all alive again!
Uncle Corey
[gleefully] No! We're dead! [leaves]
Fiancée
[returns] I love you, Richard. See you soon.
Mr. Adler
Thank you. Thank you for freeing me. I feel like now I can move on. Baby, I feel so much better. I feel so alive. [holds Kenny close] Thank you, baby. Thank you.
Stan
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Hell's Pass Hospital. The kids enter. Stan approaches a nurse
Stan
Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
Nurse
Oh. Well, I suppose a quick visit is okay. Maybe you kids can cheer them up. [leads the way. The kids follow and are let in. Craig and Tweek are in adjacent beds recovering from their injuries.]
Stan
Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?
Tweek
Rrr!
Craig
Ugh.
Stan
Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
Kyle
Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. [Craig flips them off]
Cartman
Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
Kyle
Boy, do we ever.
Stan
So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. [the group turns towards the door]
Tweek, Craig
What?!
Stan
[the group turns back to the beds] Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
Craig
What was on the news?
Cartman
Oh, you didn't see it? Oh. Tweek's family was on the news saying what a wuss you are, Craig.
Craig
Huh?
Kyle
Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
Tweek
Uuh! You son of a bitch! [pounces on Craig, and the fighting starts again, leaving the room a mess]
Craig
I'm gonna kick your ass!
Stan
Come on, Tweek! You got him!
Cartman
Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
End of Tweek vs. Craig

Sexual Harassment Panda
Mr. Garrison's classroom. The kids chat away as Token enters
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.
Kyle
About what?
Mr. Garrison
Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means? [Cartman raises his hand] Yes, Eric?
Cartman
When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
Mr. Garrison
...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda. [Petey enters]
Petey

[song and dance]
Who lives in the east 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
Who explains sexual harassment to you and me?
Sexual Harassment Panda
"Don't say that! Don't touch there!
Don't be nasty!" says the silly bear
He's come to tell you what's right and wrong
Sexual Harassment Panda

Hi, boys and girls. [the class says nothing]

Mr. Garrison
Say "hi" to Sexual Harassment Panda!
Class
[hesitant] Hi, Sexual Harassment Panda.
Clyde
Hababah...
Petey
[reaches behind the desk for a picture of two pandas in briefs] Did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little panda's underwear, that's sexual harassment? That makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. [drops his head to one side]
Kyle
[to Stan] This is freaking me out, dude.
Petey
[shows another picture of two pandas...] And when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another panda's ear, that makes me a very sad panda. [puts the picture away and gets some literature] Now, I'm going to pass out these booklets, and we're going to go through each and every sexual harassment law.
Class
Awgh..!
Five hours later...
Petey
"...Article 36, Section 19: One panda may not make sexual comments about another panda's appearance. If said panda does make..."
Stan
Ohh, dude, get me out of here!
Cartman
I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
Stan
You would think that, you little ass-sucker.
Cartman
What did you call me?
Stan
An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
Cartman
[indignant] That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
Petey
Uh-oh.
Stan
What?
Cartman
You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
Petey
That's right, he can.
Stan
No you can't, you little ass-sucker!
Cartman
Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!
Petey
"The first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda."
South Park Courthouse, day. The Honorable Judge Julie presiding
Judge Julie
This is Cartman vs. Marsh, Case No. 3433. What is your complaint, Mr. Cartman?
Cartman
Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
Kyle
[sitting by Stan] Dude! He got a lawyer?
Gerald
[entering] Sorry I'm late.
Kyle
Dad?!
Gerald
Oh! Hi, Kyle. [moves to Cartman's side]
Judge Julie
All right. Let's move this along, shall we? Now, Eric Cartman, uh, you claim that Stan Marsh sexually harassed you in school.
Cartman
Th... That is correct, my honor.
Stan
Hoh, whatever! [rests his head on his left hand]
Cartman
He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
Stan
I called you an ass-sucker!
Cartman
Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset. [sniffs, Gerald comforts him] I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. [hides his face in Gerald's coat and begins sobbing]
Stan
What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
Gerald
As you can see, Your Honor, my client is too upset to continue.
Judge Julie
Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say?
Stan
Wwhat do you mean?
Judge Julie
I need to hear your defense.
Stan
Uh... I'm eight?
Judge Julie
All right, this seems pretty open-and-shut. Stan Marsh, under the new Sexual Harassment in Schools law, I am forced to find you guilty.
Stan
Huh?
Gerald
All right, we did it!
Cartman
Hooray!
Judge Julie
Since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources, it is the judgment of this court that 50% of Stan Marsh's belongings are to be handed over to Eric Cartman immediately.
Stan
I have to give him half my stuff?
Cartman
Sweet..!
Marsh residence. Cartman is present with Gerald and a collector in Stan's room
Cartman
Let's see. I want that Clown Criminy game [on the cabinet next to the door. The collector puts it into Cartman's box], and that Power Jim doll. [goes to Stan's toy box] And, let's see... [pulls out a Mega Truck] Do you really like this remote-controlled truck?
Stan
Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.
Cartman
Oh, well, I'll just take that, then. [tosses it into his box and reaches for a lizard] And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?
Stan
Uh, no! I hate that toy!
Cartman
Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! [tosses it into his box]
Stan
Damnit!
Collector
[approaches Gerald with two toys] Here you go. As your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football.
Gerald
Hm. [drops them and walks to Cartman] You know, Eric, I've been thinking, uh...
Cartman
Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
Gerald
Uh, you know, the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools. [Cartman looks through Stan's drawers] Perhaps we should sue them next.
Cartman
What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
Gerald
Well, because they're the ones that let this harassment go on. And, they have a lot more money. I think we could get a lot more out of this than half of Stan's belongings.
Cartman
Interesting. [the collector picks up a can and presses a button on it] Ooo, Stan's asthma inhaler. I want that. [rushes to grab it]
Courthouse, day. The gavel sounds. Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Immediate Party
Judge Julie
Answer the question. Did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom?
Mr. Garrison
No, I had no freakin' idea!
Gerald
Mr. Garrison, do you know the definition of sexual harassment?
Mr. Garrison
Of course, and so does Mr. Hat. We do not tolerate sexual harassment!
Judge Julie
You are the witness here, Mr. Garrison, not Mr. Hat.
Mr. Garrison
I'm sorry, toots.
Gerald
Did you, or did you not, hear my client being called an ass-sucker?
Mr. Garrison
Yes.
Gerald
And you did nothing.
Mr. Garrison
Well, he is a little ass-sucker. [the audience laughs]
Judge Julie
[gaveling twice] Mr. Garrison, I will remind you that we are in court!
Mr. Garrison
Okay, baby, I'm sorry.
Later that day. Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Responsible Party
Gerald
Principal Victoria, were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school?
Principal Victoria
Well, not any more than any other student.
Gerald
Oh! So you admit that harassment goes on!
Principal Victoria
I don't know!
Gerald
You don't know?! You're the principal!
Principal Victoria
I can't be around every second!
Gerald
[staring her down] So it DOES go on!!!
Principal Victoria
All right, all right, I killed him. I hit him over the head and I cut up the body. I tried to burn him, but it wouldn't burn! Oh, the smell of it! I put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge. I HAD TO DO IT!! [beaks down on the stand] OH GOD!!!
Gerald
Principal Victoria, was Eric Cartman called an ass-sucker? Yes or no?
Principal Victoria
[composes herself] I believe so, yes. [the audience begins to murmur]
Man
That's sexual harassment.
The courthouse, still later. Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Expert Witness
Gerald
Last, I'd like to bring up my expert witness: Sexual Harassment Panda.
Petey
[song and dance as he goes to the stand]
Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda

Gerald
Expert witness, did South Park Elementary allow sexual harassment to go on?
Petey
Well, when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex, that is sexual harassment.
Gerald
And who's to blame?
Petey
I'm afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible.
Gerald
There! You have it! Straight from the horse's mouth!
Petey
Panda.
Gerald
Pan-Panda's mouth.
Cartman vs. South Park Elementary, The Verdict
Judge Julie
After careful review, it is the judgment of this court that South Park Elementary pays Eric Theodore Cartman $1.3 million in damages.
Gerald
All right! We did it, Eric!
Cartman
[takes his jacket off and twirls it around]

It's time to celebrate, yeah
It's time to celebrate, yeah

Broflovski residence. It is literally bigger now - 50% taller, wider, deeper... Same with the garage, itself bigger than the house to it's right. The icicles are also bigger. Furniture movers come by with new furnishings for the new, big house. Two delivery men take a big-screen TV into the house
Gerald
That goes in the master bedroom. [Kyle walks up] Well, Kyle. What do you think of your new house?
Kyle
It's... big.
Gerald
Yes, it is big, isn't it? It is very big.
Kyle
Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
Gerald
Well Kyle, schools have lots of money. You see, we all pay taxes, and part of that tax money goes to public schools, and it's from that money that we got our 1.3 million.
Kyle
[thinks a bit] And you don't see a problem with that?
Gerald
No. It's a very fragile system that nature has designed. All things flow into each other.
Kyle
You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
Gerald
Sort of, yeah.
Mr. Garrison's classroom, some days later. The alphabet strip, the poster, and the teacher's desk and chair are gone. Only the chalkboard remains. Mr. Garrison enters
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, there's a few changes being made here at school, but lessons will go on as normal. Any questions? [Stan raises his hand. The desks, pictures, and numbers are gone] Yes, Stan?
Stan
Where's our desks?
Mr. Garrison
Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits.
Stan
[huffs] You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
Cartman
All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!
Clyde
Wow! I wanna sue somebody! [smiles at Bebe]
Bebe
Me, too. I wanna get a lawyer.
Class
Yeah!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Mr. Garrison
Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun. [starts writing, with a nail. The sound just grates to the ear]
Class
[wincing] AAGGGHHH!!
Mr. Garrison
[turns to face the class] I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, "The ball is red..." [loud scratching]
Class
[wincing] AAGGGGHHH!!
The offices of Broflovski and Jackson. Gerald is in his office looking out the window. His briefcase is open. Music starts for a commercial
Gerald
[turns around] Kids! Are you tired of being harassed at school? Sick of being called a homo? A farty-pants? A butt-... face? Then call me, Kyle's dad, and I'll help you [slams his briefcase shut] close the lid on sexual harassment in schools!
Bebe
[outside] After a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth, I knew I needed legal help. Kyle's dad helped me get a $1.6 million settlement, and this bright new shiny bicycle. Thank you, Kyle's dad! [rings her bell and rides away]
Clyde
[on a yacht, The Litigator, sunning himself] Kyle's dad got me 1.4 million, and he can do it for you, too. Just look at all these beautiful girls! [four of them come to cater to him]
Gerald
So call me, Kyle's dad. Because it's not about money, it's about... wait, what am I saying? Call me! [jumps for joy. This shot is frozen as the jingle is sung]
Singers
'Kids picking on you? Well, don't be sad
Just sue their asses with Kyle's dad
["Call now! 1-555-SUE THEM"]

South Park School Board meeting at South Park Elementary
Chairman
All right, what other cuts do we have to make to the school budget?
Woman
Uh, next we have Tom Morris. He plays Sexual Harassment Panda at the schools.
Chairman
Oh, right. We certainly can't afford him anymore.
Woman
I warn you, Mr. Evans, uh, Tom Morris takes his job a little seriously.
Petey
[enters]
Hello, sexual harassment cubs.

Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda

Mr. Evans
Uh uh, have a seat, Mr. Morris.
Petey
Who?
Mr. Evans
Uh... S-Sexual Harassment Panda.
Petey
Oh, all right. [sits]
Mr. Evans
Uh—M-m-m-Mr. Morris, we at the school board have been thinking, and, we've decided that perhaps a "panda" isn't the best way to explain sexual harassment to children. [Petey's head tilts]
Woman
You see, Mr. Morris, we believe that a panda doesn't really have anything to do with... sexual harassment. [long pause] At all.
Mr. Evans
...I'm afraid we're just going to have to let you go.
Petey
[rubs his eyes] I'm a sa-a-a-a-ad panda.
The courthouse, day. The dominoes begin to tumble. Pip vs. Cartman
Judge Julie
Eric Cartman, it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed Pip Philip at school.
Cartman
No way!
Pip
I won!
Cartman
This is ridiculous!
Judge Julie
You asked Pip to suck your... you know what. You must give Pip half your stuff, and the school must give Pip $1.6 million.
Principal Victoria
[Mr. Mackey sits with her] Oh, dear God!
Gerald
Wow, I'm good!
Judge Julie
Next!
Craig vs. Wendy. They go to their respective podiums. The boys have left
Craig
This girl touched my thigh.
Judge Julie
Half her belongings, school is sued for 2.1 million.
Principal Victoria
We're ruined!
Judge Julie
Next!
Mr. Mackey vs. Tweek. They go to their respective podiums.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, Your Honor, this young man commented on the shape of my ass.
Tweek
[hops] Guh!
Judge Julie
Half his stuff, 2 million from the school.
Principal Victoria
Oh..! [faints right off the chair]
South Park Elementary, class time, barren classroom
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today. [gets out the rusty nail, but turns to see the class with Mr. Broflovski in the back] Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?
Clyde
Um...
Gerald
[admonishing] Don't answer that!
Mr. Garrison
Uh, Craig, how about you?
Craig
Um... [Gerald whispers in his ear] Okay. I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incinerate me.
Gerald
[whispers] Incriminate.
Craig
Incriminate.
Mr. Garrison
[angrily] Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time! [Gerald approaches and whispers in his ear] Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight. [Gerald leaves] Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum...
Cafeteria. The boys are in line. At least the tables are still there
Kevin
[to Red] Let's trade sandwiches.
The kitchen. The poster and menu board are missing, but the counter is there
Chef
Hello there, children!
Boys
Hey, Chef.
Chef
How's it going?
Stan
Bad.
Chef
Well, they're about to get worse. All I can serve you for lunch is lumpy potatoes.
Cartman
Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!
Chef
Sorry, children. All my funding's been cut.
Cartman
Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
Stan
Chef, how can we stop all these sexual assment lawsuits?
Chef
I don't know, children. [to Kyle] Why don't you ask your dad? He's a lawyer, ain't he?
Kyle
I've tried talking to him, but he doesn't want the lawsuits to stop. He's making too much money.
Chef
Well, somebody else has got to know all about this sexual harassment whosafudge.
Kyle
Hey, what about that stupid panda?
Stan
Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
Chef
Well, I hope you do. Otherwise, it's lumpy potatoes from here on out.
Cartman
Noooo! [runs out]
South Park School Board meeting
Mr. Evans
That's thirty-two more lawsuits in the past twenty-four hours.
Woman
Oh my God!
Mr. Evans
Looks like we'll have to cut all counseling and nutrition programs.
Woman
The children have started suing adults. They could sue us next.
Mr. Evans
Holy smokes, you're right!
Stan
[enter with Kyle, Cartman, Kenny] 'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
Mr. Evans
Ugh! [he and the other members hide behind their chairs] P-please! Don't sue us.
Kyle
[confused] Huh?
Man
We'll give you anything you want.
Stan
We want Sexual Harassment Panda.
Mr. Evans
Oh! Well, uh... We had to let him go.
Cartman
What?!
Mr. Evans
[ducks and rises again] D'uh. I mean, he left.
Stan
Well, where is he?!
Woman
We don't know! Honestly, I swear it! Please!! Let us go!
Stan
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
The Company
Company rep
Well. Uh, your credentials are very impressive, and you do seem to have a lot of ambition, uh but I'm afraid there's no room for you at our company at this time.
Petey
It's because I'm a panda, isn't it?
Company rep
Well, i-it is because you're a panda. Euh, it's because you're a sexual harassment panda.
Petey
I can't help what I am.
Company rep
Now, have you ever heard of a retreat called "The Island of Misfit Mascots"?
Petey
Well, yes, but that place is for loser mascots that make no sense.
Company rep
Well, uh, yes. They may be... just what you're looking for.
Petey
I don't have to sit here and listen to this! How would you like a big panda punch in your puss?!
Special Report: Sexual Harassment
Reporter
As sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state, the mother of all trials is set to begin. The sexual harassment case of Everyone vs. Everyone begins tomorrow. No matter what the outcome, the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping $30 million. Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski, the lawyer from South Park who plans to make quite a commission. Representing the side of Everyone Else is Gerald Broflovski. So whatever the outcome, things look very bright for Kyle's dad. Personally, I think Kyle's dad is just a whore, taking advantage of everyone in town and... [a note is handed to him] This just in! Newscaster Kevin McCarty is being sued by Kyle's dad for slander. The newscaster has yet to be reached for comment. Wait...
South Park Bar. Cool Beer In Here. A jukebox plays. Petey sits at the bar, and three unsavory patrons, two of them seated, study him.
Jukebox
Some days just seem lonely

Still, there don't seem to be no end in sight...

Barkeep
Another scotch? [Petey nods affirmatively, and the barkeep serves up another scotch. Petey sips]
Jukebox
So I'll drive this ol' 18-wheeler down the highway...

Standing Patron
Hey! Panda bear! [Petey lowers his drink to look at him] We don't take kindly to your types in here.
Barkeep
Now, calm down, Skeeter. He ain't hurtin' nobody.
Skeeter
No! [approaches Petey] I wanna know som'in' from Mr. Panda Bear here! If you pandas are from mountainous areas of China and Tibet, how come you eat bamboo, which is prone to grow only in drier, more arid regions?! [Petey has no answer]
Barkeep
Sk-heeter, I don't want no trouble nu-how.
Petey
It's okay. I get it. There's no room in the world for pandas. Well, you don't have to worry about me! I'm off to the Island of Misfit Mascots! [rises and goes out the door. Skeeter watches him go]
Barkeep
Damnit, Skeeter! How come every time a panda bear come in here you gotta go flappin' your jaw?
Broflovski residence. Now it has massive front doors, five stories, and a water fountain just to the right of the doors. The garage itself is bigger than the house next to it. And the icicles are bigger, too. More furniture arrives
Gerald
[Kyle arrives] Well? What do you think, Kyle?
Kyle
Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
Gerald
Well, this one is bigger!
Kyle
Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
Gerald
[kneels] Kyle, let me explain something to you.
Kyle
[annoyed, looks askance] Hoh God, here we go.
Gerald
You see, Kyle, we live in a liberal, democratic society. And Democrats make sexual harassment laws. These laws tell us what we can and can't say in the workplace. And what we can and can't do in the workplace.
Kyle
Isn't that fascism?
Gerald
No, because we don't call it fascism. Do you understand?
Kyle
Do you?
Gerald
[rises] Just look at how big this house is, Kyle. Just look at it.
South Park Bar. Stan, Cartman and Kenny enter. The three patrons are still there
Stan
[enters] 'Scuse me.
Barkeep
Yeah? What can I do for you?
Stan
Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
Barkeep
Big panda bear, big panda bear, hm...
Skeeter
Hey! Eight-year old! We don't take kindly to your types in here.
Barkeep
Now, calm down, Skeeter. They ain't hurtin' nobody.
Skeeter
No! [approaches Stan] I wanna know som'in' from Mr. I'm Eight Years Old here! How come you types are always wearin' them funny padded shirts in the winter?!
Stan
...Coats?
Barkeep
Now, Skeeter, I don't want no trouble.
Patron with hat
[pointing at Stan] We don't take kindly to your types around here!
Stan
Dude, what the hell is going in?!
Cartman
Did you guys see a big panda bear in here, or not?
Skeeter
[pounds the counter] We don't take kindly to panda bears!
Stan
Well, we don't take kindly to you!
Patron with hat
[pointing at Stan] Well, we don't take kindly to folks that don't take kindly around here. [they look anew at each other, and nothing more is said among them]
Barkeep
Kids, there was a panda bear in here. He said somethin' about the Island of Misfit Mascots.
Cartman
Where's that?
Barkeep
If I'm not mistaken, it's over near the Jenkins' place.
Stan
Come on, we'd better hurry. [the boys make their way past the men and leave]
Skeeter
Whoa! Lookie her! [a blonde sits alone at the bar] Hey! Beautiful woman! [she sips a beer and lowers the bottle] We don't take kindly to your types around here!
Barkeep
Nu-how, Skeeter. She ain't hurtin' nobody.
Courthouse, next day. Everyone vs. Everyone begins. Everyone is chattering in the audience
Judge Julie
This is Case No. 47g, Everyone vs. Everyone. [gavels, and all fall quiet] Representing the side of Everyone is Gerald Broflovski.
Gerald
Thank you, Your Honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Everyone has committed a crime here, and Everyone must pay for that crime. My client, Everyone, has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated.
The Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune. The boys reach the front gate
Stan
[reads] "Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune". This must be the place. [they enter]
Worm
Hello there, boys.
Stan
Whoa! Who are you?
Worm
I'm Willy, the "Don't Stare Directly Into The Sun" Worm. Now, you boys know not to stare directly into the sun, right?
Boys
Yes.
Willy
That can burn your retinas and make you blind. [pulls out some shades and a cane, puts on the shades, and sticks the cane out, to simulate a blind person, then puts his props away]
Stan
...Thanks a lot, dude.
Pig
[rushes up snapping two pairs of scissors around] Oink oink! Be sure to run around with scissors, says Oinky, the "Run Around With Scissors" Pig.
Cartman
I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
Willy
That's why he's on the Island Of Misfit Mascots. [Oinky walks away]
Stan
Have you seen any panda bears?
Willy
Hm...
Falcon
[shows up behind the boys] Hey, kids! I'm Jimmy, the "Don't Hold On To A Large Magnet While Someone Else Uses A Fan Nearby" Falcon!
Kyle
What??
Jimmy
Here, watch. [hands a large magnet to Kenny, then walks to a wind-generating fan and turns it on. As the blades rev up, the magnet tugs at Kenny]
Kenny
(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!) [the magnet pulls him into the blades, and he's chopped up into bits] (Argh--!)
Jimmy
See?
Stan
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards! [looks further on] Hey! There he is! [Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda, seated on a bench while a whale and an octopus dance to his song]
Petey
Who lives in the caves 'neath the willow tree?
Sexual Harassment Panda
[the boys rush up, and the whale and octopus leave]

Stan
Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!
Petey
Why?
Kyle
Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
Petey
Seems all I do now is cause trouble.
Badger
Hello, kidsh, I'm Hoppy, the "Don't Do Stuff That Might Irritate Your Inner Ear" Badger. [a long silence follows as the boys look at Hoppy] Well, I'll leave now.
Stan
Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
Petey
But, I'm just a panda.
Kyle
No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! [All mascots within hearing distance turn to see the cause of this outburst]
Willy
[rushes over to Petey and the boys] Heeyy, I'm a real worm, pal!!
Kyle
Okay, sorry, sorry.
Cartman
You're-you're a worm. That's that's cool, that's cool.
Stan
[to Petey] Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.
Petey
What message?
Kyle
That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
Petey
...You know? You little cubs might just be right.
Willy
Yeah!
Petey
[jumps up and stands] Okay!
Courthouse. Closing arguments begin.
Gerald
Your honor, I'd like to make my closing arguments.
Kyle
[bursting in] Wait! [Stan, Cartman, and Petey follow]
Mr. Garrison
Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda.
Stan
[faces the audience] No! He's a whole new panda now, and he's got something to say.
Petey
Hello, everyone. I'm Petey, the "Don't Sue People" Panda.
Jimbo
"Don't Sue People" Panda? [the bar patrons are present]
Skeeter
[stands up] Hey! We don't take kindly to folks that don't sue people 'round here!
Barkeep
Nuhow, Skeeter, he ain't hurtin' nobody.
Petey
Listen to me: when you sue somebody, it hurts everyone. You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you. [The courtroom is silent, listening] There's no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket. And that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda. [reactions are seen in the faces of various people in the courtroom, even in Gerald's face.]
Bearded man
I'm a sad panda, too.
Man 1
I'm a really sad panda. I didn't know we were doing all that damage. This is all that damn lawyer's fault! [people get angry at Gerald]
Man 2
[rises] Yeah! Let's sue the lawyer!
All
[rising] Yeah!
Gerald
[approaches Petey and the boys] No! Don't you see? Th-the panda's right. Boy, what a great message he has! When you sue people, you just end up causing a lot of problems for society. Uhwell, I've really learned something today. All I could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and I didn't care about where the money came from. Well, I'm no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools! They're too vague and two easily corruptible. Thank you, Sexual Harassment Panda!
Petey
"Don't Sue People" Panda.
Gerald
Yeah, well, whatever, sooo let's... not... sue anyone again. Okay, come on, guys. Let's go get some ice cream!
Petey/Boys
Hooray!
Petey
Pandas love ice cream. [Gerald, Petey, and the boys leave the courtroom]
Judge Julie
Well, seeing as we have no lawyers, I'm throwing the case out. Case dismissed! [gavels and leaves the bench]
Skeeter
[people in the audience leave] Hey! We don't take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here!
Barkeep
[passing by] God damnit, Skeeter, shut the hell up.
Public Service Announcement
Petey
Hello, cubs. I'm "Don't Sue People" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it's tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere. And usually, it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people. So, until next time, don't let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools. Good-bye now. [walks off]
End of Sexual Harassment Panda

Cat Orgy
The Cartman house, night. Cartman's room. Cartman plays off-camera while his plush lizard, Rumpertumskin, sits on the bed. Cartman does all the voices...
Rumpertumskin
[as Loveless] Heheheheh! Now I will kill the President and Salma Hayek!
Polly
[as Salma Hayek, tied to a cross standing in for railroad tracks] Oh, save me! Who will save me?
Cartman
[in cowboy gear, and six-shooter] I will! James West, cowboy and rap star! [whips out Clyde from behind his back] Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!
Clyde Frog
[as Artemus] If we save her, I am going to take off her pants and play Slip'N'Slide!
Cartman
Are you okay, Salma Hayek?
Polly
Yes, but I need to get out of here and eat some tacos and burritos. Me gusta tacos mucho!
Rumpertumskin
You cannot stop me, James West!
Cartman
Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider! [tosses Clyde aside, aims at a plush spider hanging on the edge of his toy box and fires] Bang! Bangbang! [strafes and performs a cartwheel] Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang! [tosses a baseball at the spider and knocks it out of the box] We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch... [the door opens]
Liane
[nicely dressed, looks in] Eric. [he turns around and drops his shades and the gun] The babysitter's here. Come on downstairs.
Cartman
[begging] But mmmooom, I'm playing Wild Wild West.
Liane
I have to leave soon, Eric.
Cartman
But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
Liane
Come down as soon as you're done. [exits and closes the door]
Cartman
[begins to rap]
Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside-

The kitchen. Liane fixes herself as Shelly looks on
Liane
Thank you so much for babysitting little Eric, Shelly.
Shelly
Okay.
Liane
All those other babysitters won't come back.
Shelly
I charge $5 for the first hour, 5% bumps every hour after that up to six hours, which enters into golden time.
Liane
Oh, that sounds fine. I'm going to a meteor shower party. The number where I'll be is on the refrigerator. Eric's nookie time is 9 o'clock sharp. If his little woogums get cold, you can turn up the heat over here. And if he gets cranky, just play tummy-rub-rubs with him, and make sure he wipes good after he makes bears.
Shelly
Bears?
Liane
Oh! And don't mind the cat. She's just being loud because she's in heat.
The living room. Cartman is on the sofa watching TV now, and Kitty is near him
Kitty
Meowrowr!
Cartman
No, Kitty! I don't have anything!
Kitty
[starts rubbing her ass against the sofa] Meow rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
Cartman
What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!
Kitty
[looks at him with her ass up in the air] Rowrrowrrowrrowrrowr!
Cartman
No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty! [Kitty runs away]
Liane
[enters with Shelly] Okay, muffin. Mommy's leaving now. You do what the babysitter tells you, okay?
Cartman
[absently] Uh-huh.
Liane
Be good.
Cartman
[huffs] Right.
Liane
Come give Mommy Eskimo kisses! [kneels next to Cartman]
Cartman
Aw, Ma.
Liane
Eskimo kisses for Mom-my!
Cartman
[mad] Jesus Christ. [drops to the floor, and they rub noses]
Liane
Bye, kids. [gets up and leaves the house]
Cartman
[now approaches Shelly] Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry! [she punches him into the wall, which leaves an impact site with paint fallen off] Ow!
Shelly
Alright, turd, listen up! Now that your mom is gone, I'm in charge. I don't know how you treat your other babysitters, but when I'm babysitting, you're nothing but a little turd. You're a stinky dried-up stupid turd! Got it?!
Cartman
You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? [she punches him, sending him into the wall again]
Shelly
My boyfriend is coming over, so you go to the kitchen, and you make us that pizza before I snap you in half like the little turd-stick you are!
Cartman
You're not allowed to have people over!
Shelly
[takes the remote] Move! [points towards the kitchen, and Cartman eventually rises and goes there]
The kitchen. Cartman walks to the refrigerator
Cartman
This is bullcrap! [strains to open the freezer, but fails] I can't reach the freezer!
Shelly
[from the living room] Figure it out, turd!
Cartman
[huffs] God dammit! [goes for a chair and props it up in front of the refrigerator. As he hops onto the chair, Kitty walks in still pining] Shut up, Kitty! [turns and sees the note on the freezer door, then grabs it and reads it] Any problems, contact Eric's Mommy at 303... Aha! [hops off the chair, moves it back to the table, and sits on it. He grabs a telephone] I'm gonna call mom and tell her that the babysitter is having her boyfriend come over! Then we'll see who's the turd! [he picks up the receiver, only to find a familiar voice on the line]
Shelly
...So I said, "you're a little turd!" and he w-
Cartman
[hangs up] Dammit! [waits for a moment, then picks up the receiver again. Kitty now pines on the stove]
Shelly
...But when you've seen one turd, you've seen them all. [hangs up, waits, then picks up again] ...stupid turd! The one night-
Cartman
Ey! I need to use the phone!
Shelly
Oh. Hold on a second, Carrie. [enters the kitchen and pulls Cartman's underwear over his back and head, blinding him]
Cartman
Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah! [she leaves and he picks up the receiver again]
Shelly
I placed his underwear over his head.
Cartman
[hangs up and puts his underwear back in place. Kitty resumes meowing] I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!! [her meows are persistent] SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! [Kitty screeches and dashes out of the kitchen]
The living room. Cartman watches TV
Announcer
And now, back to the movie of the week, Aliens.
Newt
[to Ripley] They mostly come at night, mostly.
Cartman
[echoing Newt] They mostly come at night, mostly. [Shelly comes in and tosses Cartman off the sofa, then changes the channel to Friends. Cartman returns to the sofa] Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!
Shelly
Well, I'm watching Friends, turd! [the doorbell rings] That's my boyfriend. Go answer the door while I make sure I don't have food in my braces. [Cartman answers the door and looks at a young man in baseball cap and leather jacket]
Dude
Hey there, is Shelly around?
Cartman
Who the hell are you?
Dude
I'm the guy who's gonna put a boot up your ass if you don't tell me where Shelly is!
Shelly
[appears at the door] Hey, Skyler.
Cartman
You know this guy?
Shelly
He's my boyfriend! [Cartman studies him]
Cartman
Christ, he's like 50 years old!
Shelly
He's 22! [Cartman studies him some more]
Cartman
Dude, that's not cool.
Shelly
You're a turd! You're the Turdman of Alcatraz!
Skyler
Ye Yeah-ha.
Cartman
Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly. [Skyler enters and pulls Cartman's underwear over Cartman's head. Shelly grins and Skyler drops him.] Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God dammit!
Shelly
Turd wedgie. Come in the kitchen, Skyler. There's refreshments [giggles and takes his hand. They walk to the kitchen. As they pass the sofa, Kitty is looking at TV]
Announcer
And now, back to Wild Animal World
Host
[a lion follows a lioness around] Here in the more arid regions of Africa, the gold-coat lions are in the throes of mating season. [Kitty watches intently as the lion overtakes the lioness. The lioness lays down] The male lion positions himself behind the female and prepares to insert his lionhood. Notice his large swollen balls. [Kitty meows loudly with excitement as the lion does his stuff] The female lion relaxes her body and says "hello" to Mr. Winky. [Kitty continues meowing. The lioness rolls over on her back] The male lion is enticed by the female's supple breasts and firm backside. [The lion moves away] Quickly and suddenly, the male is finished. Now he wants to be alone, so he kindly asks the female to leave. He promises he'll call her tomorrow. But the female doesn't leave. Nope, she's moving right in. Looks like the male lion... is screwed. [lion and lioness relax as the sun sets. Kitty is almost beside herself, rubbing her ass against the rug]
The kitchen. Cartman cooked the pizza after all. Shelly and Skyler finish it
Skyler
Mmmmm. [tries to kiss her]
Shelly
No, Skyler. Quit it.
Skyler
Come on, babe. How long have we known each other?
Shelly
Eight days tomorrow.
Skyler
And I still don't get any action.
Shelly
I don't know, Skyler. It's just kind of strange to me that you're 22 and all.
Skyler
But I'm still in high school. I told you: I'm a very immature 22-year old.
Shelly
Well, maybe just one kiss.
Skyler
Mmmmm [kisses her on the lips, but Cartman intrudes]
Cartman
Hey, what are you doing? [Skyler pulls back quick]
Skyler
Beat it, chubby!
Shelly
Go on, Astroturd!
Skyler
Mmmmm [a tongue-kiss]
Cartman
I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
Shelly
Turd Rock From the Sun!
Cartman
Ey! You ate all the pizza!
Shelly
We left you some crusts! [tosses some to him]
Cartman
That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! [she snatches the note from him and sends him into the wall with one jab]
Shelly
Guess again, Richard the Turd!
Cartman
Give me that phone number!
Skyler
Come on, babe. Let's go to the living room. [they leave]
Cartman
[rises] I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick! [thinks for a moment] Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
Kitty
[walks in] Meow.
Cartman
God dammit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. [goes to the sink, opens the doors, and starts looking]
Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. [pulls out a box of Playful Pussy Catnip and pours some onto the floor in front of Kitty]
Kitty
Meowrowrowrowrowrowrowrowr. [still longing for consummation, she jumps all over the kitchen knocking things over]
The living room. Skyler strums on the guitar as Shelly listens
Skyler
Red Rocket spills my icy soul.

Demons from Hell seek the chosen one!

Shelly
You're such an amazing poet, Skyler.
Skyler
[putting the guitar aside] Isn't this guitar awesome? It's the best of its kind, and not a scratch on it. [reaches over to kiss Shelly]
Shelly
[holding him off] Skyler, not here.
Skyler
I can't help it. I see your pretty lips and I want to kiss them. [draws her close]
Shelly
[giggles] Really?
Skyler
I cherish you, almost as much as I cherish my guitar.
Shelly
Wow!
Skyler
When I make it to the big time, I'm gonna take you shopping, and buy you lots of badass stuff.
Shelly
O Skyler, I love you. [their lips lock]
Skyler
Mmmmm. [A flash bulb goes off and Shelly stands up on the sofa]
Shelly
What the-?
Cartman
[with Polaroid camera in hand and a fresh picture] Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!
Shelly
[lunges after Cartman] Give me that picture!
Cartman
Aaaaa! [runs away, and she gives chase. He runs up the stairs, but she catches up and grabs him by the foot halfway up the stairs. He kicks her off, then hurries to his room, closing the door on her as she reaches him] Yes!
Shelly
Open this door, Turdledove!
Cartman
I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
Shelly
Your mom doesn't get home for three more hours! That's plenty of time for me to make a turd sandwich out of you. [Cartman is shocked at the possibility]
later that night
Shelly
[banging on Cartman's door] Give me that picture, turd!
Cartman
You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
Shelly
[in the hallway] I'm gonna bust this door down! [starts banging on the door again. Kitty is meowing]
Cartman
[sees his toy frog on the bed and walks over] What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? [dons his cowboy hat]
Clyde
[with his Wild Wild West shades on] We've got to get that picture to your mom so that she will come home and save us.
Cartman
Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog. [doffs his hat and sees Kitty on his dresser rubbing her ass on the wall. He walks over] Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar. [the banging subsides] You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me. [walks to the window and sets Kitty on the sill] Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope! [Kitty jumps from the window to the garage roof, then from the roof to the trashcan, then to the ground] That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! [Kitty ends up at the front door]
Kitty
Meow. Meow. [the door opens and Shelly takes her in]
Cartman
Oh! God dammit!
The living room. Shelly takes the picture and the door bell rings
Shelly
Who is that?!
Skyler
Oh, I invited the guys in the band over, so that we can practice. [moves to answer the door]
Shelly
Skyler, your band can't practice here.
Skyler
Hey, do you want me to make it or not?! Don't stand between me and my dreams, babe! [opens the door and the bandmates come in] 'Sup Mark? [carrying drums] 'Sup up. Jonesy? [carrying other drums]
Shelly
Just keep the volume down! I have to go deal with Turdboy. [walks away]
Cartman's room. Shelly knocks on the door
Cartman
Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
Shelly
[faking concern] Hey Eric! Your mom's been in an accident!
Cartman
[wary] You just want me to open the door!
Shelly
We need to run over to the hospital and identify her body! We'll be right back.
Cartman
What?? Ih- is she okay?
Shelly
Not really. She's dead.
Cartman
Huh?! [quickly opens the door]
Shelly
[enters] Haha! That was a turd trick. Your mom isn't really dead!
Cartman
Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!
Shelly
HAha! I knew you sent the cat, and that's why I went outside and got him!
Cartman
Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!
Shelly
[walks to a dresser] You mean this one? [hold out the letter she finds]
Cartman
O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, dammit! [he turns away defeated, and she gives him another wedgie over the head] AAAAH! [she pulls him downstairs by his underpants and enters the living room. Cartman groans at every step he hits]
living room. Shelly drags Cartman past the band and hurls him onto the coatrack
Skyler
Okay, check check, check, 1, 2, check. Okay, ready? All right, let's try the new song. This is a song I wrote for you, Shelly. [points at her and winks. She sits on the sofa, happy]
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
When I saw her walking down the street, I thought she was Shelly, Shelly.
[she dances in place on the sofa]

Cartman
Aw, man, you guys suck.
Skyler
Now that we're together I'm absolutely sure that she's Shelly, Shelly.
Cartman
You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
Skyler
Move into my mom's house with me, Shelly Shelly

Outside. Kitty is at Cartman's window once again. The band is heard in the background
Kitty
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
A cat
[from a red house nearby] Meow. [Kitty looks to see where the meow coming from] Meow.
Kitty
[urgently] Meow?
A cat
Meow. [Kitty looks to make sure there's no one around, then jumps onto a car parked on the driveway and runs away. A red van is parked on the street]
Living room. Skyler's band continues playing
Skyler
Bridge!
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States
of Shelly
Shelly!

Cartman
[rocks back and forth on his hook, hands to ears] Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head!
Skyler
Ey, shut up, tubby!
Cartman
Don't call me fat! Now, you guys are not supposed to be in heuh! [Shelly walks to the coatrack] You get out now and respect my authoritah! [she pulls Cartman down a bit so the coatrack can act like a slingshot. She lets go and Cartman hits the ceiling] Ow! [lands on his feet as Shelly turns to walk away. She stops to watch the band and he picks her pocket to get his mom's note.]
Night. Kitty wanders the streets of South Park
Kitty
Meow?
A cat
Meow.
Kitty
Meow?
A cat
Meow. [Kitty is near the source, but keeps looking]
Kitty
Meow? [enters a small passageway between two buildings]
A cat
Meow.
Kitty
Meow?
A cat
Meow. Meow. Meow. [an obese orange cat on his back rolls over and inches over to Kitty. Kitty looks at the camera]
Cartman's house, living room. The band finishes up
Skyler
Yah, dude, that was hot. This guitar rocks, man! It rocks! What do you think, Shelly?
Shelly
Honestly? I think you guys need some work.
Mark
Oh, really?!
Shelly
I just think your sound is kind of... last week.
Jonesy
Oh, I'd like to see you do any better, bitch!
Shelly
Well, I do have a song I wrote.
Skyler
O-kay, why don't you sing it for us?
Shelly
Nnno, Skyler, I'm embarrassed!
Skyler
Hey man, don't be shy.
Shelly
Uhwwell, okay. [hops off the sofa] I'll try. But I'm not promising anything. [Skyler moves to the keyboard as Shelly hands out her music and takes the mic]
1, 2, 3, 4
So much pain in the world today.
Too many turds are headin' my way.
But we can press our turds together.
Passing by turds whenever.

Skyler
Don't you know? Isn't...

Shelly
Life so full of happiness?
Feel free to mark my words.
But me and you, will my love do
in a world that's full of turds? TURDS!
llama judgin finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!

Cartman's room. He's taken the phone upstairs with him, extension and all, and he's called Liane
Cartman
Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
Liane
No no no, that's impossible, hon. I told her: no visitors.
Cartman
Well, there's a whole crappy band here! ["TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin' turds. TURDS!"] Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? [directs the receiver towards the music]
Liane
This party is very loud, boopy-kins. You'll have to speak up.
Cartman
["TURDS! Llama judgin' finger-lovin'..."] Dammit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!
Liane
Not really, hon. [Mr. Mackey appears behind her] Mom has to go now! I'll be home in about an hour! [Cartman just looks at the receiver] Oh! Oh, Mr. Mackey!
Mr. Mackey
Mhm, mkay? [upset, Cartman hangs up]
Cartman
I'll never be able to prove that son of a bitch was here! [looks at his Mr. Microphone-type radio] My Speak and Record bear. Of course.
Downstairs, Shelly continues her song
Shelly
In a world that's full of turds. TURDS!
Mark
[tiring of the song] Dude, this is gay!
Skyler
Shut up! [Shelly stares at Mark]
Mark
You shut up! Your girlfriend is not joining our band!
Jonesy
Yeah, dude. What the hell is wrong with you, anyway? She's like, 12.
Skyler
You guys, get out! Don't question my love! My love is as pure as morning snow! Get out, I said! [his mates take their instruments and leave]
The passageway. Kitty and the fat orange cat face each other
Kitty
Rowr! [quickly shows her ass to the orange cat, waiting for his move. The orange cat pounces on her and smothers her] (Rowrowrowrowr!) [she squeezes her way out from under him]
Oragne cat
Rowr!
Kitty
Rowr. [this time, she rolls on her back. He jumps on her and smothers her again] Hrowr!
Oragne cat
Geuugh. [Kitty makes her way out again]
Kitty
[angrily] Meowr! [the obese cat simply collapses and sleeps] Meowuh! [seeing that the cat won't move, she leaves] Oh meah!
Cartman's room. He begins recording
Cartman
[softly] Testing, testing, 1 2. [stops and rewinds, then plays the tape. The recording worked] Sweet. [Shelly enters and Cartman hides his radio]
Shelly
We're going outside to watch a meteor shower! I'm locking you in your room 'til we get back in, turd!
Cartman
Okay. See you in a while.
Shelly
Wha-?
Cartman
Will you tell me what they look like? The meteor shower. They mostly come every few years, mostly.
Shelly
What the hell is wrong with you?! How come you're not yelling and whining?!
Cartman
Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
Shelly
What?! No you don't!
Cartman
No. Um seriously. See, I never had a brother or a sister. I think people that have a brother or a sister don't realize how lucky they are. Sure, they fight a lot, but you know there's always somebody there, somebody that's family. [Shelly's face softens] I wonder if, well, maybe sometimes, I could pretend like you're my big sister. And you could kind of, watch over me. You know, like, we could watch a meteor shower together sometime. Heh, and I could pretend I'm somebody's brother, if only for a day.
Shelly
...Oh, all right, get your turd coat. You can come see the meteor shower with us.
Cartman
Yuh, you mean it?
Shelly
But don't bug me and Skyler! Come on!
Cartman
Hooray! [Shelly exits, Cartman speaks softly] Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.
The Cartman backyard. Skyler and Shelly sit on a bench, Cartman stands off to the side in front of them
Cartman
[recording] Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.
Shelly
Shut up, turd!
Cartman
That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
Shelly
What are you doing?
Cartman
I'm just thinking out loud. [walks over to the bench and sits with his back to Skyler] Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
Shelly
Go away, turd!
Cartman
I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler? [Skyler simply bumps him off the bench] Agh!
South Park. Kitty walks around looking for some action
Kitty
Meow [a bunch of other cats answer her call. They are all sitting by some steps. She walks over, sticks her ass in the air, and the other cats jump her]
The Cartman backyard. Meteors flash across the sky. Skyler tries to kiss Shelly. Cartman stands close to the house with his Speak and Record bear in full view
Skyler
Yeah! Come on! Give it up!
Shelly
No.
Skyler
Give it up, babe!
Shelly
NO!
Skyler
Come on, babih!
Shelly
[pushes him off] No, Skyler, I'm not putting out for you!
Skyler
Why the hell not?!
Shelly
'Cause I'm twelve! [Cartman moves up a bit]
Skyler
You're not putting out for me?
Shelly
No!
Skyler
Well then, screw you, bitch! I've got plenty of other girlfriends that will!
Shelly
What?? But I thought you liked me.
Skyler
If you're not puttin' out, then I'm movin' on! There's plenty of chicks like you out there! [she looks forsaken, Cartman draws closer] Screw you, prude bitch! Me and my badass guitar are going home! Hasta!
Cartman
Gotcha! [Skyler drives away in the red van]
The living room. Shelly sits on the sofa crying, her face buried in her hands. Cartman comes dancing in
Cartman
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted! [Shelly continues crying] Hey! I said, guess who's busted! [Shelly doesn't seem to realize he's there] Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!

Shelly
[between tears] I don't care. [cries some more, then pours out her emotions] He acted like he really liked me. Nobody's ever liked me before. [now Cartman softens] I can't believe I trusted him. I'm so stupid.
Cartman
Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
Shelly
Nobody my age would go out with me 'cause I'm too ugly.
Cartman
You're not ugly.
Shelly
You don't think so?
Cartman
Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
Shelly
You're right! He is a scumbag! I wish I could get him back! I just don't know how.
Cartman
Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
Shelly
Huh?
Cartman
If you want, I could help you.
Shelly
Really? You would do that?
Cartman
Just let me get my cowboy hat.
Outside. Kitty returns to the house, opens the front door, and enters
Kitty
Mreow? Mreow? Mreow! [the other cats come in and make themselves at home. Kitty turns on the stereo and music blares from the speakers. More cats come]
Skyler's pad. He sits on his sofa strumming his guitar. He hears a knock on the door. He gets up, opens it, and looks down. Clyde is there
Skyler
What the hell is this?!
Polly
Help me! Help me! This is Salma Hayek. Is anybody there? [she lies next to the bear, which is playing the voices]
Skyler
Salma Hayek? Whoa, she's hot. [goes into the woods to find her]
Cartman
[dressed as James West, reaches the open door] Okay, it's clear. [Stands watch as Shelly makes her way inside]
The woods.
Polly
Over here! Please, come quick! [Skyler moves towards the voice]
Skyler's pad. Cartman stands watch as Shelly gets to work
Cartman
We don't have much time!
Shelly
This won't take me long!
The Cartman house. The front door remains wide open as music blares from inside. Cats are all over the living room. Kitty bring a box of Playful Pussy catnip from outside and pours out the catnip. The other cats rush towards it and divide amongst themselves. One cat makes lines of it so he can snort it, another snacks on a slice of pizza. Others sip from beer bottles. Some cats come towards Kitty and she shows her ass again.
Skyler's pad. Cartman grows impatient
Cartman
Hurry up in there!
Shelly
I'm almost done.
The woods. Skyler is looking...
Skyler
Hello-o? Hello-o, Mrs. Hayek?
Polly
Over here! Please help me! I am lost and I have no clothes!
Skyler
[to himself] No clothes, right.
Skyler's pad. Shelly finishes up
The woods. The search continues...
Polly
I'm over here! Please help me! I will reward you greatly!
Skyler
Right here, Miss Hayek!
Polly
Oh, please help me!
Skyler
What the? [sees the Speak and Record bear and Polly Prissy Pants on the ground]
Polly
Please help me! I will give you tacos!
Skyler
Dude, somebody tricked me! I'll make you pay for making me come out here, God dammit! [rushes home and enters] Stupid asshole stuffed animals trying to ruin my night! [gasps loudly. His guitar is in pieces and buried in kitty litter. Shards of wood are arranged to read "King Turd" in front of the neck of the guitar] My guitar! NOOOOO!
The Cartman house. Shelly and Cartman return home
Cartman
That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
Shelly
[faces him at the door] Thanks for all your help, Eric. You know, as far as turds go, you're okay. [opens the door, and they both are shocked at what they see]
Cartman
Oh my God! [the orgy is well under way]
Shelly
They're having a cat orgy!
Cartman
You are all very bad kitties! That is a bad, bad kitty!
Shelly
Your mom's gonna get home soon. We're gonna get busted!
Cartman
[gets the catnip and holds it up high] Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on. [points the way out, then goes towards the door. The cats follow] That's it. Come on, come on. [opens the door, only to find Skyler waiting for him] Uh oh.
Skyler
You two ruined my career! I'm gonna get you! [Cartman throws the catnip at him and scores] Umph! [the cats jump on him] Ogh! Oh! Owey! Owwey! Duewy! Oh! [horror and then glee appear on the faces of Cartman and Shelly] Oh, you ripped my pants off! Oh my God! Oohh my Goodd!
Shelly
Come on! We've got to get the house clean before your mom gets home. [they go back inside and close the door] You know, Eric. It's kind of cool that two people who hated each other can be friends.
Cartman
Yeah. I think we get along okay.
Liane
[enters] Hi, kids. I'm home.
Cartman
Heh. [all are afraid. Two cats hide behind Kitty] Mom! Uh I can explain. It was all Shelly's fault! She didn't watch the cat!
Shelly
No! It's Eric's fault. He let those cats in here.
Liane
[holds on to the doorway] Oh, what a party that was! [walks towards the sofa] Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. Hmm-hm-hm-hmm. [Crashes onto it and falls asleep]
Shelly
Wow, she passed out.
Cartman
Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
Shelly
Well, let's clean up the house. Looks like everything turned out o-kay.
Cartman
That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. [raps once more]
Cartman
[Shelly watches him perform and grins, then joins him in the dance]
Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age, wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
[End credits roll]
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider

End of Cat Orgy

Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub
The Marsh car, night, Randy's driving. He and Sharon take Stan along with them. It seems Shelly has already been dropped off at Cartman's house to babysit him.
Stan
I don't want to go to this stupid party!
Randy
Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
Stan
No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
Randy
Well, your mom and I don't get out much, so you'll just have to bear through it.
The Mackey house. The Marshes arrive. Four other cars are there, one of them double-parked. The house is festooned with stars of various sizes, with two shooting stars among them. A banner reads, "METEOR SHOWER PARTY" while a sign on the door reads "WELCOME SKYWATCHERS." The Marshes reach the door and Randy rings the bell. Mr. Mackey answers.
Mr. Mackey
Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm.
Randy
Yeah, well uh, sorry we had to bring the kid along. We had nowhere else to put him.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement.
Stan
Awww!
Mr. Mackey
[leads the family across the room] Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflé, and uh, eh, Juanita? [clap clap] Juanita? [clap clap] We need some more finger sandwiches? [she scurries by]
The basement. Mr. Mackey leads the family down the steps.
Stan
I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
Randy
Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
Mr. Mackey
[opens a door] Here you go, it's right in here. [Stan enters and gasps. Before him are Pip, Butters, and Dougie.]
Randy
We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.
Stan
[soft but urgent, tugging at Randy's pants] Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
Sharon
You have fun, Stanley.
Stan
[soft but urgent, tugging at Sharon's dress] No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
Mr. Mackey
We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts. [closes the door. Stan looks at it with hands in pockets, then he looks at the other kids. Pip, Butters, and Dougie smile at him. Stan tries to open the door, but it's locked. He turns to face his peers.]
Pip
Cheerio, Stan. I do say it's quite a nice surprise seeing you here.
Stan
Shut up, Pip.
Butters
Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
Stan
Butters, is there any way out of here?
Butters
Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room. [motions to the little boy to his left] Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
Dougie
I like math.
Stan
Oh my God.
Pip
We were just playing a game called Wickershams and Ducklers. Do you want to play?
Stan
No.
Pip
I'm the head Wickerknicker. And you are all little Wickershams [Butters bows] We all sing the merry tune of Stratford until I yell, "Turrah!" and then you all fall down laughing, and I join you, as I find it funny too. Stan, would you be the Wickersham of Brumble Briar? [Stan just looks at them] And all right, here we go. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.
All three
Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la. [Stan tries opening the door again]
Upstairs. The party is well under way. Mr. Garrison walks up to Mr. Mackey
Mr. Garrison
[quite drunk] Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass. [his right hand jerks to the right, pulling him] No! Mr. Hat, you get back here! [walks away. The Marshes and the Broflovskis stand in front of the punch bowl]
Mr. Mackey
Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
Sharon
Oh, I'll pass. I don't drink hard alcohol.
Mr. Mackey
[offers the drink] Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. [Sharon takes it]
Randy
One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
Sharon
Well, it is kind of a special night. I guess I could... experiment. [she takes a sip]
Randy
Yeah, experiment.
The basement. Pip, Butters, and Dougie continue with Wickershams and Ducklers. Stan sits on the floor with his back to them, arms wrapping his knees
All three
[dancing] Whippy-tippy tootoo, tralala-la.
Pip
[all turn 'round] Wickersham tally-ho ugh. [all fall on their backs. Pip gets up] Are you sure you don't want to play, Stanley?
Stan
[looks back] Yes.
Dougie
What are you? A sourpuss?
Butters
Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice. [Pip walks off] Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh? [annoyed, Stan covers his ears] They got those thick noses and all.
Pip
[looks in a box] Hey, look at this!
Butters
Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. [he and Dougie reach the box and look in]
Pip
[leafing around] It's a box filled with ladies' clothes.
Dougie
[pulls out a padded bra and checks it out] Neato.
Butters
Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
Stan
[incredulous] Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me.
Pip
[hopping] Yes, let's! Can I be Jaclyn Smith? Can I?
Butters
No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
Pip
[twirls with joy] Oh, this sounds as much fun as Wickershams and Ducklers! Come on, Angels. Let's get dressed. [walks over to Stan] Which ladies' garments would you like, Stan?
Stan
Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
Pip
Well. [turns and walks away] Alrighty then.
The backyard. A hot tub sits just behind the house. Mr. Mackey leads the Marshes and Broflovskis to it
Mr. Mackey
Here it is. I just had the hot tub put in last week.
Gerald
Wow, neat!
Sheila
It looks quite inviting.
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub.
Sharon
Oh Mr. Mackey, you nut.
Randy
Hell, we should get in.
Gerald
Yeah.
Mr. Mackey
Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?
Sharon
Oh, I'm not hot-tubbing. I have nothing to wear.
Mr. Mackey
Hm huheh, that's okay. [giggles]
Sheila
No hot tub for me!
Gerald
Well, screw you guys! [disrobes and jumps in]
Randy
I'm getting in for a while, too. [disrobes and jumps in] Geronimo!
Sharon
Oh, look at our boys, Sheila. [Randy and Gerald splash each other] It's just like they're in college again.
The basement. The Angels are dressed and ready for action, but...
Pip
Okay, Angels, what's our mission this week?
Butters
Well, I don't know what our mission is. Do you know what our mission is, little first-grade kid?
Dougie
How should I know?
Pip
Oh, dear. We're Charlie's Angels, but we don't have a mission.
Butters
Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. [strokes his chin. All three look around, but the silence alerts Stan]
Stan
[looks back displeased] What?
Pip
Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?
Stan
[grudgingly] What do I have to do?
Butters
Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
Stan
Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
Pip
Oh, that's a splendid mission!
Butters
Well, what are we waitin' for? We've gotta find a way out of this room, by golly, or else we're gonna get drowned. Come on, Angels! [they go in different directions, but Dougie pauses]
Dougie
Which Angel am I again?
The hot tub. Gerald and Randy relax in its bubbling warmth
Randy
Oh boy, it's nice to have a night out without the kids, huh?
Gerald
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Randy
I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
Gerald
Well, that's what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that's why I'm gonna smoke this cigar. [brushes it under his nose and sniffs it] Only 'cause I've never smoked before. [picks up a lighter and lights the cigar, then sets the lighter back]
Randy
Good idea.
Gerald
What haven't you tried that you've always wanted to try?
Randy
Hohn. [raises his elbows to the rim] Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.
Gerald
Yeah! ...Was that your leg?
Randy
Huh? Oh, you mean, this?
Gerald
Yeah.
Randy
Yeah. That, that was me.
The basement. Pip rushes up to Stan
Pip
Bosley! Bosley!
Stan
[in no mood for role-playing] What, Pip?
Pip
Oh no no no. My name is Sabrina Duncan. Remember? We're playing Charlie's Angels.
Stan
What the hell do you want?!
Pip
Well, we've completed our mission. Jill found a way upstairs.
Stan
You did? [rises and walks to the way]
Dougie
[dressed as Jill] Air shaft.
Butters
Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
Pip
So Bosley, what's our next mission?
Stan
We're going upstairs.
Butters
Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
Stan
Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! [crawls into the duct]
The hot tub
Randy
Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.
Gerald
She sure does. I wouldn't mind takin' that home.
Randy
O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
Gerald
I wish. That's the one thing I've always thought of experimenting with. A threesome.
Randy
[eager to know] With two girls or two guys?
Gerald
Huh, well, two girls, of course! I mean ...with another guy, you know, that'd be... [ends up staring at Randy]
Randy
You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.
Gerald
You haven't?
Randy
No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?
Gerald
Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don't know... masturbate in front of another guy.
Randy
Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
Gerald
NO, no, uh I don't think so.
Randy
...Well it is a night for experimenting.
Gerald
Sure is. [both of them wait for the other to make the first move, then...]
Randy
Okay, I'll start. [begins]
some activity is going on out on the street. Someone is looking at the house through night-vision scopes and taking snapshots. One of those shots is of Liane talking to her son over the phone. Five ATF agents are now seen looking at the house from across the street
ATF lead
This must be the place. They've got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.
ATF agent
[talks into a communicator] Code 7. We believe we have found the compound. Request immediate backup. [the ATF lead looks at the house again]
Barbrady
[immediate indeed, appears in the lead's sights] Okay, so just what is going on here, people?
ATF lead
Get down! [pulls him into position along with the others]
Barbrady
What?
ATF lead
It's just like we told you, officer! There's a religious cult in there that plans to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts. [resumes viewing, but is interrupted]
Barbrady
Are you sure?
ATF lead
Of course we're sure! [points out the initials on his cap] We're the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It's our job to know what these fanatics do!
Barbrady
So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?
ATF lead
Oh, don't worry! We won't let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them.
Out front, later. ATF trucks and tanks roll in and more agents arrive
ATF lead
What's the situation?
ATF agent
[coming in from reconnaissance] Apparently, we've got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts.
ATF lead
Any luck talking to somebody in the house?
ATF agent
We've tried calling, but there's no answer. I think we're gonna have to move in, sir.
ATF lead
Alright. Johnson!
Johnson
[a marksman, runs up] Sir!
ATF lead
I'm sending you in. Watch your ass.
Johnson
Yes, sir! [makes his way to the front door while stopping at various points for better views. He rings the doorbell with his elbow, but doesn't wait for an answer]
The Mackey house, living room. Johnson now looks around the living room, but no one seems to be alarmed at his presence. Mr. Mackey's face soon fills the view
Mr. Mackey
Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay? [Johnson, surprised, lowers his guard] Would you like a meteor mai tai?
Johnson
Heeey, I love mai tais! [closes the door]
The living room, at the ventilation duct. Stan leads the others out
Pip
We did it! Great job, Angels!
Butters
So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
Stan
[mischief flashing across his face] Alright, Angels. Uh, your next job is to get Bosley some cookies and a TV set.
Pip
What kind of cookies do you want, Bosley?
Stan
I don't care, just hurry! [the Angels walk away]
Butters
Well, hooray!
The deck. Gerald and Randy have left the hot tub and are getting dressed. Things get awkward
Gerald
[buttoning his jacket] So uh. Well. That was certainly... interesting.
Randy
[tying his shoes] ...Yeah.
Gerald
Uh, you don't regret doing it now, do you?
Randy
No no. ...Wuh what's there to regret, right? I mean..., all we did was watch each other ...masturbate. That's that's not gay or anything. We said so, right?
Gerald
Thuh that's right. It's just harmless experimenting.
Randy
Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. [turns to go in]
Gerald
Hey. [Randy looks] Nothing changes between us, right? I mean, we're still friends.
Randy
Um... Yeah yeah sure sure. [goes inside]
Outside, the ATF agents are armed and ready to fire. The lead agent reviews the situation inside with his scopes
ATF lead
Damn it, where is Johnson?!
ATF agent
No communication, sir. It doesn't look good for him.
ATF lead
Those bastards!
Inside. Johnson is dancing away. A couple is about to leave the party
Man
Great party, Mr. Mackey. Thank you so much.
Mr. Mackey
Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?
Woman
We both have to be up early tomorrow, but thanks again.
Mr. Mackey
Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay? [waves them off and closes the door]
Outside, The couple walks a few steps before two spotlights stop them in their tracks
ATF lead
[On a bullhorn] Hold it right there! Whatever it is you are intending to do, do not do it! [the man shrugs] Your freaky religious cult will not succeed in its plan!
Man
What?
ATF lead
Do not move, or we will be forced to shoot- [Shooting starts. The couple falls dead and the lead lowers the bullhorn] God damn it, who was that?! [most of the agents raise their hands] Did you see them move?!
Agent 1
...I did.
Agent 2
[next to floodlight] Yah.
Agent 3
Yeah, they moved alright.
Inside, several men gather around Jimbo and Randy.
Jimbo
Well, I tell you what: we may not have Elway this year, but Brister won every game he started in last year.
Burly man
Eh that's true, but Elway was the heart of the team. Who's the leader now?
Blond man
I think the Jets are gonna be the team to beat this year in the AFC.
Randy
Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?
Jimbo
...What??
Randy
Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.
Burly man
Well... Let's go kick his ass!
Other men
Yeah!
Jimbo
Where is he?!
Randy
Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.
Burly man
Aw! [the men disperse]
Gerald
[walks up] Hey, Randy. What are you doing? [pats him on the back]
Randy
[subdued] Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
Gerald
Can I come with you?
Randy
[softly] Okay. [rolls his eyes]
Mackey's bedroom. Butters leads Stan inside
Butters
Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea. [Pip and Dougie are already inside, waiting] Uh I got to thinkin', "Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
Stan
Rad! [hops on the bed and starts switching channels]
Pip
Okay, Bosley, we got you cookies and a TV set. So what's our next mission?
Stan
There are no more missions. I have everything I want. [four shows and a commercial pass by as he channel-surfs.]
Butters
Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
Stan
[annoyed] Just... play something else! God!
Pip
Oh dear. We've angered Bosley.
Breaking news
Reporter
Tom, I'm standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts.
Stan
Whoa, cool!
Dougie
I wanna be a reporter someday.
Reporter
Just moments ago, a couple emerged from the house. [footage of it is shown] According to the ATF, the couple refused to cooperate, then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone. The ATF had no choice but to shoot the insane couple, and now a standoff has ensued.
Pip
Oh, looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits.
Reporter
The ATF commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all. There are choppers here along with several tanks. [choppers and tanks are heard coming in] The commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside.
Stan
[as the reporter speaks] Wait a minute [hops off the bed and walks towards the window. He looks out and sees the ATF] Oh my God! [runs back to the others] Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
Dougie
Do you think someday I can be a reporter?
Reporter
We just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house [Stan looking out the window just moments before] showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside. Those sick cult fanatic bastards!
Stan:
Dude!
Butters
Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
Pip
Yes. Come on, Angels. Looks like we have a new mission.
The living room. Everyone is carrying on, drinking and dancing, oblivious to the commotion outside. Randy sits on the sofa, his hands to his eyes, his mind in turmoil. Gerald walks up to him
Gerald
[sits] Randy, you're making me feel unimportant. Talk. Talk, damn you.
Randy
I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
Gerald
So, so now we can't be friends?
Randy
I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.
Gerald
We said we'd never tell anybody?
Randy
[now cross] Well, of course we wouldn't.
Gerald
Oh, uh I didn't realize that. [looks away ashamed]
Randy
[sensing betrayal] Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?
Gerald
Well, uh uh a few people, yeah.
Randy
[hushed] What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
Gerald
You didn't say not to tell anyone.
Randy
[hushed] Well, of course! I thought it would be implied! When you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub, you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody! [looks around in desperation to make sure no one else is listening]
Gerald
Listen to you. You're yelling at me; you've never yelled at me before.
Randy
AAAW!! [jumps up and hurries away]
Stan
[rushes out with the others in tow] Hey you guys! We've got a big problem! [sees everyone quite drunk. A naked man dances by with a lampshade on his head] The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. [the adults didn't hear him]
Butters
Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
Stan
[sees his mom waddle by] Mom, go look outside.
Sharon
[drunk, with mai tai in hand] Mommy's little boopie-kins [falls down and out]
Butters
Uh let me handle this, Stan. [walks forward] Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! [The adults laugh and his face drops]
Stan
Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. [walks to the door. The others follow]
Outside. The boys step out, the ATF agents reload, and the door closes. The spotlights come on and the commander takes up the bullhorn
ATF lead
Lay down your weapons!
Stan
We don't have any weapons.
ATF lead
Go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded! Tell them to come out peacefully, and we will not shoot them. [Shooting starts]
Butters
Whoa!
Stan
Get back inside! [opens the door and the boys hurry in]
ATF lead
I don't think they're gonna come out. Use the Ganz technique.
Barbrady
What's the Ganz technique?
ATF lead
This is what we did in Waco. [two monster speakers are moved into place on either side of the front of the house. A technician readies the large CD player] Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out. [the technician presses a button and a garbled song plays] Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn't drive them out, nothing will.
Living room, the stereo. Mr. Mackey turns on the very same song and starts dancing to it
Mr. Garrison
That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?
Mr. Mackey
Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
Mr. Garrison
Well, hell, turn it up.
Living room, away from the stereo. Randy is walking around. Two men talk in the foreground
Goateed man
Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he's gay.
Other man
Oh, is he?
Randy
[runs up] Who?!
Goateed man
Huh?
Randy
Who who did you hear is, is gay?!
Goateed man
Ricky Martin, the singer.
Randy
Oh. [the two men walk away as Gerald approaches]
Gerald
Hey, Randy, what's up?
Randy
[tenses up] What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
Gerald
Huh?
Randy
Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
Gerald
Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin' to you.
Randy
There's nothing to talk about.
Gerald
You're having regrets, aren't you?
Randy
No, I-... I don't know.
Gerald
Hey. Talk to me.
Randy
No!
Gerald
I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn't change our relationship.
Randy
Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
Gerald
Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, you might not need to talk about it, but I sure do.
Randy
Aaww! [rushes away] Sharon? [finds her at a table and genuflects] Sharon, cuh can we go?
Sharon
[swaying] Go?? The meteor shower hasn't even started yet.
Randy
[his voice grows urgent] Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.
Sharon
Randy, relax. We don't ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!
Randy
Ogh, I already did.
Stan
[rushes up with the other boys] Dad! Dad, they shot at us.
Randy
Not now, Stanley. [gets up and walks away. Stan watches him go, then turns to Sharon]
Stan
Mom!
Sharon
Whoopee! [gets up, and the bowl of chips drops to the ground. She faints on the table. Stan looks around, not sure how he can rouse the adults to action, drunk as they are.]
Butters
[panicking] Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
Stan
[slaps Butters across the face with a backhand and grabs him by the collar] Get a hold of yourself, man!
Butters
How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
Stan
Come on. We have to find out what's happening. [leads the other boys to the bedroom]
Mackey's bedroom. The boys enter and check out the news again.
Reporter
I'm standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?
Ganz
We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now.
Dougie
See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That's why I wanna be a reporter.
Reporter
So what are your plans, commander?
Ganz
Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they'll have no choice but to come out.
Butters
Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
Stan
Sh!
Reporter
Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander.
Ganz
It is, but we can't let them kill themselves.
Stan
We have to let them know that this isn't a cult party.
Pip
But we can't. They'll just shoot at us again.
Butters
Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
Stan
Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. [walks off]
Outside. The reporter continues
Reporter
For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out.
Inside, the party continues.
Mackey
Hoh, look. Harold's doing it again, hm huh hnmkay? [Harold is wearing a lampshade, but he's fully dressed. The camera moves to the crowd, then to the ground, where Dougie is standing with microphone in hand]
Dougie
This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party. [Stan is filming, Butters is cuing] As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us. [aside] Anything else?
Stan
Tell them not to burn us down.
Dougie
Oh yeah. Don't burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.
Pip
Now what do we do?
Stan
[removing the tape from the camera] Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
Dougie
Hey, I'm a real reporter.
Stan
You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. [Dougie smiles]
Outside, Ganz is back behind the firing line with the bullhorn
Ganz
Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs. [turns off the bullhorn and listens for a moment] Alright, I'm through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator! [a large truck hauls a large cannon in. The barrel of the cannon reads, "NEGOTIATOR"]
Reporter
[approaches] Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?
Ganz
We know what we're doing. We did this all before in Waco.
Reporter
Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves.
Ganz
[holds out a beanie baby] Look. You see this? You see this?
Reporter
Yes.
Ganz
You see it? You see it? Go get it. [throws it away to his left] Go get it! [the reporter soon moves in the direction of the throw] Alright, let's get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!
Inside. Randy is scarfing down some nachos at the snack table, and Gerald approaches him. Randy sees him and gives him the evil eye, then moves to the mai tai bowl. Gerald follows. Randy glowers at him
Gerald
Having a good time?
Randy
Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?
Gerald
I'm not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won't let it change our friend-
Randy
[irritated, interrupts] We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! [walks away]
Outside. The front door opens and six guests exit
Guest
Good night, everyone.
Ganz
Look out! [Shooting starts. Screams are heard as the guests are hit. The guests die on the spot] Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm. [on the bullhorn] People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender! [the Negotiator is aimed right at the front door]
The boys are in Mr. Mackey's bedroom. From outside, the boys are seen looking out the window
Stan
Oh no, we're out of time! [hops down and moves away. He ties some rope around Butters' middle] Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
Butters
Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
Stan
We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. [hands him the video]
Butters
Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.
Stan
Can you hit a target, Pip?
Pip
[with bow and plunger] I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire. [pulls back on the bow]
Stan
Hit something nice and solid now. [Pip releases the plunger, with rope attached, and it lands on the left side of Barbrady's head. Barbrady moves just a bit, then sips his coffee]
Pip
[pulls the rope taut] I think that's got it.
Stan
Nice job, Pip.
Pip
Did I do a nice job? Really?
Stan
Alright, Butters. Now it's your turn. [he and Dougie help Butters onto the window sill and hook him up to the rope]
Butters
Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now. [Dougie pushes him off] Waaah! [slides down to Barbrady and bounces off the hook] Gooh. [runs to the reporter]
Stan
He made it down. [Pip and Dougie grin]
Outside.
Ganz
Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command! [the agents take aim]
Butters
Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?
Reporter
Huh?
Butters
Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. [hands it to the reporter, who inspects it]
Inside, living room. Randy stands alone in the middle of the crowd, despondent
Gerald
[walks up] Honey?
Randy
[hushed] God, everybody's looking at me. Everybody knows.
Gerald
Everybody doesn't know. And why are you so ashamed of me?
Randy
What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
Gerald
I just want to know it meant something to you.
Randy
It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry! [the music stops] All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! [people turn and stare. One man gasps and Sharon lifts her head from the floor]
Man in briefs
Aw, I was just in the hot tub. [a man next to him pulls away]
Randy
Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares! [shots of various people looking at him] We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!
Mackey
Uh. Well, it's not like you're the only guy who's ever watched another guy masturbate; I've done it.
Ned
Mmm-me too. [other men begin to answer]
Man 1
Yeah, uh I've done it a few times.
Man 2
Yep.
Man 3
Yup.
Man 4
Uh huh.
Man 5
Me too.
Man 6
Myeup, me too.
Man 7
Yup.
Jimbo
Aw, hell, uh I've done it too. With Cameron here. [points to the burly man who spoke earlier]
Mackey
[music resumes] Uh, Juanita, could you fix some more dip, please, Juanita? [she goes to do it, and conversation resumes among the guests]
Randy
You mean it? I'm not gay?
Jimbo
[walks up] Hwell... maybe a little. But we're all a little gay.
Randy
Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!
Gerald
So we're friends again?
Randy
Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
Outside. The Negotiator is rolled into placed and aimed once more
Ganz
Alright everyone, fire!
Reporter
[runs in front of the cannon and waves his arms] Hold on just a minute! This is Derek Smalls reporting. We have just received an exclusive video from inside the house [holds it up], proving that the people inside are not cultists after all.
Ganz
[to an agent] Uh oh. [runs to address the agents and waves his arms] Uh uh attention everyone! This has only been a test. Good job, men, on this, uh, simulation.
Blond agent
Simulation?
Ganz
[to the blond] Sh. [to all] All is well. Do not shoot at [BOOM. The cannonball hits a house behind Mackey's, then bounces to crush another, then another, and yet another. Stan, Pip, and Dougie rush outside to join the reporter.]
Pip
O-hoh, I believe we've saved the day! [Butters joins them]
Ganz
Woops.
ATF agent
Sir, this isn't gonna look good.
Ganz
You're right. Quick, let's get out of here! [in the blink of an eye, every ATF agent and vehicle rushes away, leaving a clear road]
Derek
Say, that was a fine piece of journalism, boys.
Dougie
Wow, you mean that?
Derek
Sure. Why, with your tape, I'll be able to make millions and further my career beyond my wildest dreams. [walks away with the tape]
Butters
Uhuh oh uh, uh hooray, then!
Pip
There. Angels, I must say I think we did a smashing job.
Butters
Uh we, we sure did. Why, we put the fear of God in those ATF sons of guns, I can tell ya.
Stan
But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
Butters
Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
Kyle
[shows up] Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
Stan
You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
Kyle
Hoh, dude, weak.
Stan
Super weak.
Kyle
Come on. I'll tell you all about what happened to me. [goes inside with Stan and Ike, leaving the Melvins outside sad.]
Cher's mangled song plays.
End of Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub

Jewbilee
Broflovski residence. Gerald and Sheila are with Ike at his changing table in his room.
Sheila
Hold still, Ike! We have to get you dressed! Where the heck is Kyle?
Gerald
I don't know. Come on, Kyle! You're gonna be late for Jew Scouts!
Kyle looks in the bathroom mirror to make sure everything is set, and hums. Both he and Kyle have little pigtails hanging from their hair.
Sheila
Kyle!
Kyle
I'm coming, Ma! [the doorbell rings]
Sheila
Go get the door, Kyle!
Kyle
[to himself, angrily] "Get ready", "answer the door", Jesus Christ, make up your friggin' mind! [exits]
Living room. Kyle walks across to the front door and opens it
Kyle
Oh! Hey, Kenny.
Kenny
(Kyle, I'm gonna camp and watch the meteor shower. Do you wanna come and see it with me?)
Kyle
I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
Kenny
(What's that?)
Kyle
It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
Kenny
(Oh, that's alright.)
Kyle
Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
Kenny
(Really?) [follows Kyle to the sofa, where Kyle's parents now wait]
Kyle
Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
Sheila
...Uhwell, Kyle, Jewbilee is sort of a ...special thing.
Kyle
...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
Kenny
(Aw.)
Sheila
No, no, you're very special, Kenny. It's just that... well, Jewbilee is... for Jewish kids. [Kyle and Kenny have blank stares]
Gerald
You see boys, Jew Scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different Jewish denominations. From the Orthodox Jews, from the Hasidic Jews, from the Northern Italy Cave Jews... But you have to believe the basic tenets of Judaism to be a Scout.
Kyle
Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Sheila
Kyle, eh, the problem is...
Kyle
Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
Gerald
Oh, all right. Just don't let any of the elders know that he isn't Jewish, okay?
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Sheila
Come on, Ike! [he hops in] It's time to go to Squirts!
Kenny
(Squirts?)
Sheila
You have to be in Squirts if you're too young to be a Jew Scout.
Kenny
(Oh.)
Sheila
Don't worry, Kenny. I'll fill you in on our faith on the way up there. [everyone heads out the door]
In the car. The family and Kenny drive south as a full moon rises. Sheila gives a quick overview of the Old Testament, or Tanakh
Sheila
And then, Kenny, Abraham's wife bore him no children. She had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go into my maid."
Kenny
(Uh huh.)
Sheila
Abraham begat Isaac, who the Lord then said to kill. But that was just a little silly trick to see if Abraham would do it.
Kenny
(Uh huh!)
Ike
Eng jeck. [takes off his cap]
Kyle
No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
Sheila
Ike, you behave!
Ike
Buwor? [takes off his cap again]
Kyle
No, Ike!
Ike
Buh buh buh buh. [the cap is back on, the bandana comes off]
Kyle
I don't think Ike wants to go to Squirts.
Gerald
[turns to face the boys] Ike, your brother Kyle was in Squirts, and so was I. You have to go so someday you can be a big brave Jew Scout.
Ike
No-o. [takes off the pigtails]
Gerald
Tell Ike how much fun Squirts is, Kyle.
Kyle
What? You want me to lie?
Gerald
Yeah, lie.
Kyle
Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--
Sheila
Oh my God, what is that?! [brakes hard and stop. A big brown bear is walking towards them.]
Gerald
Hey, it's a bear! [the bear turns left and walks into the woods]
Kyle
Wow, cool.
Sheila
This retreat really is out of the way, isn't it?
The Jew Scout camp. The sign on the entrance reads, "WELCOME TO JEWBILEE." They reach the Jew welcome station
Ranger
Welcome to Jewbilee. You folks find it okay?
Gerald
Yeah. [the boys leave the car] Actually, we saw a bear a few miles back.
Kyle
He was huge.
Ranger
Yeah. We spotted him a few days ago. Nothing to worry about, though. Your boys are safe with us.
Sheila
I'm sure they are.
Gerald
We'll be back to pick you up after the meteor shower party, boys.
Sheila
Good-bye, boys. Kyle and Ike, you be safe. And Kenny?
Kenny
(Uh huh?)
Sheila
Try and act Jewish. [drives away. Ike is properly dressed again]
Kenny
(How do you do that?)
Squirt leader
[arrives with his troop] Come on, Squirt! We're meeting over here! [motions to the place]
Kyle
[Ike hides behind him] Who are you?
Squirt leader
I'm the Squirt leader. I don't want to be the Squirt leader, but I don't have a choice; it's the only way I can earn my chutzpah badge. So I gotta spend all night instructing Squirts.
Kyle
You have to go with him, Ike.
Ike
Buh buh buh buh.
Kyle
Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. [points to it.]
Ike
Boul ball.
Squirt leader
Come on! [drags Ike away. The Squirts leave as well, and the ranger returns]
Ranger
Name?
Kyle
Kyle Broflovski.
Kenny
(Kenny McCormick.)
Ranger
What?
Kyle
Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.
Ranger
[writes the names] Alright, get to Meshuggeneh Hall! The meeting is already starting.
On the way to Meshuggeneh Hall. Kenny is curious about the buildings, naturally.
Kenny
(What's that?) [about the CHAMBER OF ELDERS]
Kyle
This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
Chamber of Elders, the meeting. The Chief Elder sits on a futuristic throne, from which he can look down at the other elders
Chief elder
Baleilah hazein, Hame kadesh mekoh hikenazu puanazikeh hakeilah. (Now gather us, the elders, on this most holy of nights.)
Elders
Helalelah, het Moshe. (Praise Moses.)
Chief elder
I want to welcome you all. Though we each come from a different sect of Judaism, on this night of Jewbilee, we all pray to Moses as one. Hineinih kureh leirukeshu. (May all the power of Moses show the way...) Now, let us all introduce ourselves.
Elder 1
[with buns on his head] Elder Carn, from the Orthodox synagogue.
Elder 2
[with mustache] Elder Harris, from the Hasidic sect.
Elder 3
Elder Garth, from the synagogue of anti-Semites.
Chief elder
[cautiously] I don't believe I've heard of the anti-Semitic sect of Judaism before.
Elder Garth
We're new.
Squirt's Lair. Stars of David are everywhere
Squirt leader
Okay, Squirts, the elders have given us a very important task tonight. We are all going to make macaroni pictures, like this one, [pulls out a picture of the Star of David made from macaroni] using dry macaroni, paper, and glue.
Squirt 1
How come we have to make macaroni pictures?
Squirt leader
[angrily] Because that's what Squirts do! Now, shut your pie-hole!
Squirt 2
What's your name?
Ike
No.
Squirt 2
How come your head is lookin' so... funny-looking?
Ike
Uh-uh. [doffs the hat and pigtails and hops to the window. He sees Kyle and Kenny walk to Meshuggeneh Hall]
Meshuggeneh Hall, the camp lodge, but inside it looks like a lecture hall. The banner outside says, "Jew Scouts Meeting Hall"
Elder
And that's how we'll be making tonight's craft. And so you see, Scouts, all you need is a bar of soap and a dull knife [displays them], and you can make nifty soap sculptures like these. Here's a giraffe. [displays it] And here's a cloud. [displays it] You can all pick up your bars of soap later on, as we will all be making soap sculptures tonight. [Kyle and Kenny enter and take their seats] Now, this year we are pleased to announce that Jewbilee has grown to over one hundred Jew Scouts from all around the country. All new inductees, raise your hands. [several of them raise their hands. None of them wear the Jew Scout cap yet.]
Kyle
That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. [Kenny does so. The elder spots the new Scouts, but returns to an odd prospect]
Elder
Uhhhh, yess, and what is your name, young man?
Inductee
Junichi.
Elder
O-oh, wonderful, uh, uh, um... [places his index finger on his lower lip] Cu-could you run out and grab some... some of those candles for us? [Junichi leaves, and the attendant locks the door immediately] There we go. Ahem. [Kyle notices the injustice that has just been done] Now, I would like all the new inductees to step forward, please. [the new Scouts leave their seats and come up]
Kyle
This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. [Kenny moves forward]
Elder
Raise your left hand and repeat after me: I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
Inductees
I pledge to be a Jew Scout.
Elder
My honor, wide and true.
Inductees
My honor, wide and true.
Elder
I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
Inductees
I am proud to be a Jew Scout.
Elder
Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew.
Inductees
Otherwise, I'd just be a Jew.
Elder
[brings forth a large bell] Nahit chaim.
Inductee 1
Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head and strikes it once to produce a long, loud peal, then raises it. The boy walks off]
Elder
Nahit chaim.
Inductee 2
Nahit chaim. [the elder lowers the bell over his head, strikes it, and raises it. The boy stumbles away crying]
Elder
Nahit chaim.
Kenny
(Nahit chaim.) [the elder lowers the bell over his head, strikes it, but Kenny ducks] (Ha! Hiheh haha.) [the elder lowers it again and strikes it several times to make sure] (Hah! Oh my God!)
Squirt's Lair. Macaroni projects now due
Squirt leader
Okay, Squirts, let's see what you made macaroni pictures of. Ishmael?
Ishmael
Apple.
Squirt leader
Good. Matthew?
Matthew
Cat.
Squirt leader
Joseph?
Joseph
Triangle.
Squirt leader
Okay. Ike?
Ike
Cokeshen.
Squirt leader
[gasps] ...You don't make a macaroni picture of the Last Supper at a Jewish camp! [growling and other noises are heard] What the geez? [outside, a bear is searching through trashcans. The leader goes to the window] Oh my God, it's that bear they've been talking about! [the bear looks back, then jumps and runs away, leaving the trashcans strewn about and trash everywhere. The leader walks out with the Squirts] Where did it go?! Squirts, go grab your gear! We're gonna hunt us a bear! Then I'll get my chutzpah badge for sure!
Chamber of Elders. Meanwhile...
Chief Elder
Elehem hav dorim, ashoseveh laoleinu. Hakadosh boruku, omasheh hachreit. (Tonight, for the meteor shower, we will pray to Moses. Then we will give Moses thanks.)
Elder Garth
[losing patience] Oh, enough already. What has Moses ever done for us?
Chief elder
All sects of Judaism follow the words of Moses.
Elder Garth
Not mine. Tonight's meteor shower is a sign of the New Time, heh. We should use it to pray to Haman and enter into a new millennium faith, and it--
Chief elder
Enough, elder! You will not speak the name of Haman here!
Elder Garth
All you ever do is worship Moses, but it says in the Book of Centuries that Haman will one day lead the Jews.
Elder Harris
We pray to Moses here, elder.
Elder Garth
If you guys love Moses so much, why don't you marry him?!
Chief elder
We accept all denominations of Judaism here at Scouts, elder, but your synagogue of anti-Semites is too strange! Get out and do not return: you are no longer welcome here!
Elder Garth
Fine! [goes to the door and turns] Jewbilee is the time of Haman! You will all see how wrong you are, very soon! When Haman returns from the Ninth Tower of Disillusionment, and smotes Moses and all his followers into pillars of dust that would cry for their petty lives but can't, having recently been turned into dust and all, you will see! You will see this very night! [walks out and closes the door.]
Chief elder
Hello.
Campfire. The Jew Scouts form a ring around it and sit. Kyle and Kenny stand behind the chief elder.
Kyle
Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
Kenny
(What the fuck are we doing?)
Kyle
This is where we all stand in a circle and pray to Moses for guidance during Jewbilee.
Kenny
(Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)
Kyle
It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
Chief elder
Alright, Jew Scouts, the meteor shower will start soon. Let's pray to Moses for guidance. [spreads his arms out. All the Scouts close their eyes save Kenny, who looks around first, then closes them.] Moses, great leader, on this blessed night of Jewbilee, we ask for your tutelage.
Scouts
May the teachings of Moses fill our ears and our hearts respectively.
All
[the elder first, then the Scouts join him one by one] O...
Elder Garth
[behind a nearby tree] Stupid assholes. Moses ain't gonna teach them anything! [softens to pray] Do not fear, Haman. This night shall be yours, and the anti-Semitic Jews will once again rule the Earth.
The Squirts and their leader march through the woods...
Squirt leader
We are Squirts, we are Squirts; we're so kosher that it hurts
When we get older we'll be Scouts, but until then we are Squirts
[gasps. The brown bear is in front of him approaching a pile of crap] There he is, Squirts. [the bear turns up its snout, but sniffs again] Okay, Squirts. Remember the plan: immobilize and attack. Matthew, y-you immobilize the bear with the net, then Echo team, run up and attack it with your Squirt knives. [the bear sniffs some more] Don't get too close now, just close enough to throw the net on the stupid bear. [Matthew goes forward with the net. The leader and the other Squirts hide behind some bushes and watch. The leader then barks] Now! [the bear turns to see Matthew and growls, and Matthew throws the net on himself]
Matthew
Oh, funt. [the bear takes the net and carries Matthew away] No!
Squirt leader
Oh, no! [the bear disappears] Oh, God! [comes out of the bush with the Squirts] Oh, the bear took a Squirt. Oh, I'm gonna get it now!
Back at the campfire, the Scouts are trying to summon Moses
All
[long note] O... [the Scouts are now holding hands as they chant]
Kenny
[notices some rumbling] (What's happening now?)
Kyle
[looks at him] Shh. Shut up, Kenny. [rejoins the rest in chanting, the fire builds, and a huge techno-colored dreidel rises out of the fire. A face appears on it]
Kenny
(What the fuck is that?!)
Kyle
[stops long enough to say] That's Moses, stupid! [rejoins the rest in chanting]
Chief elder
Great Moses, we, your most loyal followers, want to thank you a lot for coming.
Moses
The hour of Jewbilee is near. Let all debts be forgiven and all slaves freed. Mwaaaaaaaaaah!
All
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Chief elder
Alright Scouts, let's all show Moses our soap sculptures so that he may rejoice and be pleased. [the Scouts approach Moses one by one, offer their sculptures, and drop them off before him]
Kyle
[steps up and offers his] It's a duck. [Kenny steps up, but he's just starting on his sculpture]
Behind the tree. Garth reads from the Book of Centuries
Elder Garth
"And it was foretold that the spirit of Moses would finally rest when his spirit was imprisoned by Haman in a conch shell of blind faith." Conch shell, like this one, hnee. [produces one from his robes]
Campfire.
Chief elder
Moses, the Squirts have made you tidings of macaroni pictures. They should be here any second. [walks up to Elder Harris] Where the hell are the Squirts? [Elder Harris shrugs] We need those macaroni pictures for Moses right now!
The woods. The Squirt leader is setting a trap for the bear. He places some bait on a tray swinging from a rope as the Squirts hold the rope steady from behind a bush. Then he pours some DED RAT grains onto the bait
Squirt leader
Now, we'll just see how Mr. Bear likes rat poison. [reviews his work] Well now, that'll be enough to kill a stupid bear. Okay, raise the tray! [the Squirts start heaving] Chutzpah badge, here I come. [the bear shows up and growls] Yikes! [runs for the bushes and reaches the Squirts] Okay, here he comes. Easy now. Easy, Squirts. [the bear comes closer, sniffing] Okay, Squirt, lower the tray. [the Squirt begins to lower it] That's it. That's it, you god-damned stupid bearface! [the bear rears up and pounces on the tray, jerking the rope.]
Squirt
Agghhh! [the leader gasps. The Squirt is pulled into the air and lands in the tray] Ah--! [the bear carries him off] Agghhh!
Squirt leader
Jesus! Hell, he got another Squirt!
Ike
Mommy.
Squirt leader
[steps out of the bush with the Squirts] You think you can stop me from getting my chutzpah badge, you stupid bear?! Think again!
Campfire. The Scouts now sing "Kumbaya," a spiritual
All
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya
O Lord, Kumbaya
Chief elder
Great and honorable Moses, what do you desire from us, your children?
Moses
I desire... [the elders and the Scouts await anxiously] I desire... mamaroni pictures.
Chief elder
Yeh yes, yes, the macaroni pictures are coming right away. Uh, anything else you want from us, O great leader of the people?
Moses
I desire... popcorn necklaces.
Chief elder
You heard him. Get to making popcorn necklaces right away! [the elders and Scouts scatter] All you need is some popcorn, and a needle and thread. [Kenny finishes his sculpture, which is of himself, as the last few Scouts leave. He then offers it and leaves it on the pile]
Moses
Hold! [Kenny stops in his tracks as Kyle looks on. Kenny looks at Moses] There is... an impurity.
Garth
[still behind the tree] Oh no, he's on to me, Haman.
Chief elder
[the Scouts gasp and Kenny droops] An impurity, Moses?
Moses
This child here is not kosher.
Kenny
(Uh-oh.) [Garth looks, curious. Kyle rushes to Kenny's side, and the Scouts move in on them] (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)
Kyle
Don't worry. I know what to do.
Chief elder
Scout Broflovski, have you defiled Jew Scouts by bringing a non-Hebrew to Jewbilee?! [the Scouts grow angry]
Kyle
Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
Kenny
(What?!) [the Elders and Scouts approach Kyle and Kenny closer]
Campfire. Some time later...
Chief elder
A non-Jew has infiltrated Jew Scouts and looked upon the face of Moses! He must be dealt with!
Kenny
(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)
Chief elder
You are banished from here. You must leave before the great eating of carrot cake.
Kenny
(What?!)
Kyle
He doesn't get cake?
Moses
No cake for the impurity.
Chief elder
Go now. You do not belong here. [points to the woods. Kenny comes out of the middle of the group and walks towards the woods. Kyle is sad for him. Kenny looks back, then faces forward and walks on]
Moses
[spins around and around] Aaggghhh! [the others turn to see what's happening]
Elder Garth
[prostrated, with conch in hand] Infatu camdavid. David hakum ba'ikan shtud!
Chief elder
Elder, what are you doing?!
Elder Garth
[now standing with hands outstretched] Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht!
Elder Harris
He's reading from the Book of Haman!
Elder Garth
Enter the conch shell, Moses! [thrusts the shell forward]
Moses
[spins and shrinks to fit in the shell] Eo! Eh! Diu! [disappears into the shell]
Elder Garth
And there you shall stay, trapped for all eternity!
Chief elder
Elder, what have you done?
Elder Garth
I told you, the meteor shower is the time of Haman! I am running Jewbilee now!
Elder
[from Orientation] Release Moses, now!
Elder Garth
[pulls out a gun] I don't think so. [all gasp]
Scout
When do we get to eat carrot cake?
Elder Garth
Now... All of you into that building, or I shoot you where you stand!
Chief Elder
Elder, you cannot mean--
Elder Garth
Move! [drives them towards the building. Kenny peeks out from behind a tree. Garth follows the last of the Scouts to the door, closes it, and padlocks it. He descends the steps and heads for the campfire as the others look on through the window, frightened] Now! Now, Haman, your time has come!
Kyle
Dude, what the hell is going on?!
Chief elder
If he summons Haman, we will all be destroyed.
Kenny
(Oh no!)
Woods. The Squirts still march
Squirt leader
We are Jew Squirts, we know Jewish
Stick stick smiley smiley Stick stick smiley smiley
dur dur dur dur dur--
Hold it, Squirts! This is where we'll set our trap. Everyone remember your squadron. Alpha-5 and Gamma-7 will be on recon teams. Alpha will take left flank and flush the bear out of sector three. Once we're in position, I want constant contact between all squad leaders. We'll flush him out and we'll attack him! [the bear comes up silently and snatches another Squirt]
Squirt
Agh! Agghh! [the bear rushes away]
Squirt leader
[not missing a beat] Remember, this is only a bear. All we have to do is stick together, and we can spend the rest of the night making bear sandwiches! [turns and counts his troop] Where's Zigmal?
Ike
No.
Squirt leader
God-damnit! You stupid god-damned son of a bear, you've taken your last Squirt! Do you hear me?!
Campfire. Elder Garth is kneeling before it, summoning Haman.
Elder Garth
And the Ancient One looked upon Haman as the new leader of the people! [clouds roll in and the winds whip Elder Garth's hair around] And it was the night that stars flew around the sky! [the meteor shower goes by] Yes! Yess!!
Chief elder
If he summons Haman, it will be the end of everything we hold dear.
Scout
I wanna go home.
The road. Kenny walks along the curb, then sees reflections of headlights in front of him. He turns to see a car coming and tries to stop it
Kenny
(Stop!) [a red car speeds by. Kenny watches it leave, then hears more vehicles coming] (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!) [Barbrady and the ATF speed by as well] (Shit!)
The woods. The Squirt leader takes the Squirts back to camp.
Squirt leader
That bear thinks he can outsmart me! Well, I'm not gonna let a stupid bear get the-- [gasp] Hold! Look over there! [a figure resembling a Squirt stands alone in a clearing in front of a cliff] It's one of the Squirts the bear took. Maybe he's okay. [takes the Squirts over to the figure to make sure. They arrive, only to see a straw Squirt - straw dressed in a Squirt uniform. The Squirt leader looks at the straw Squirt long and hard before deciding] It's a trap!! [jumps out of the way as a net descends and traps the rest of the Squirts. The full net rises to a high branch; the bear comes to the edge of the cliff and carries it away] Damn! Damn, damn, damn! Okay, bear, that does it! You wanna kill all the Squirts?! You can have 'em! I give up! I don't need my chutzpah badge, or Jew Scouts, or any of this crap! Forget it!
The campfire. The meteor shower continues
Elder Garth
Let the New Tide turn! Let Haman rule his people once again!
Chief elder
No! [Kenny walks into the camp again]
Elder Garth
We await your return, Haman! [Kenny stops to see Elder Garth at work] Your passage is safe from the enemies!
Kenny
[the bear finds him and carries him off] (Aghh!)
The building. The chief elder tries to burst through the door, but fails
Chief Elder
It's hopeless.
Elder
Haman will be summoned and we will be forced to obey him, or die. [the Scouts are scared]
Elder Harris
Uh I'm fine with obeying.
Elder
Yeah, obeying should work out swell. [!]
Kyle
Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
Elder 2
How?
Kyle
Kenny will find a way.
The bear cave. The bear brings Kenny in.
Kenny
(Haaarrrrrh!) [the bear drops him off and leaves the cave] (Huh?)
Squirt
Hey, welcome to the party. [Kenny studies the scene] See this li'l bear cub? It's his birthday.
Squirt 2
Yeah, so his mommy brought us all over to play with him.
Bear cub
Mrar.
Kenny
(Aww.) [the momma bear comes and licks a Squirt's face, and the Squirt laughs] (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... [indistinct chatter])
Squirt
They are? Uh oh.
Kenny
(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)
Squirt
Come on, Squirts. We have to help them.
All
Yeah! [everyone, including the cub, races out of the cave]
The camp. The Squirt leader returns alone
Squirt leader
Elder Schwartz, I lost the Squirts! I lost all the Squirts! [no answer] Well, screw you too! I don't need your Chutzpah badge anyway! Hello? [in the building behind him, heads rise from under the window sill]
Elder Schwart
[the chief elder] Shlomo, get us out of here!
Shlomo
[Squirt leader] What the geez? [turns and walked towards the hostages] What are you guys doing in there?
Elder Schwart
Get the keys and unlock the door! [the Scouts jump up and down]
Schlomo
What?!
Elder Schwartz
[now points] Get the keys and unlock the door!
Schlomo
[doesn't understand what Schwartz is saying, but gives his own news] I lost the Squirts! [Elder Garth appears behind him]
Elder Schwartz
Look out!
Schlomo
Huh? [turns to face Garth]
Elder Garth
Don't move!
Schlomo
[backs up quick] Oh, Jiminy gravy, what is this??
Elder Garth
It's the summoning of Haman, fool! The awakening of a new kingdom, heeheh!
Schlomo
You can't wake Haman. What would Moses say?
Elder Garth
Moses is trapped for all eternity in the conch of blind faith!
Schlomo
[sees the shell and dives for it] Oh, no you don't! [grabs it, but Farth shoots him. The bullet grazes Schlomo's right shoulder, which he then covers with his left hand, dropping the shell] Ooowww!!
Elder Garth
Enough of this waste of time! [turns and goes back to the campfire. Once there, he reaches for the Book of Haman] Haman! The Great Summoning is done! Upon these words let your spirit come! Einich! Hos!
Elder Schwartz
It is lost.
Elder Garth
Zayak. Kareem! [Kenny comes up behind him]
Kenny
(Woohoo!) [takes off with the book]
Elder Garth
Hey, give that back! [chases Kenny into the woods. The Squirts line up before the window where the hostages await]
Elder Schwartz
It's the Squirts.
Kyle
Go, Ike!
Elder Schwartz
Unlock the door, Squirts! The keys are up there.
Elder Harris
They'll never reach.
Squirt
Squirts, fall in. Chinese formation. [the Squirts hurry and climb up one on top of another to form a human pillar]
The woods. Elder Garth catches up to Kenny
Elder Garth
Give me that book! [knocks Kenny down]
Kenny
(Ow!) [gives up the book, and Garth kicks him]
Elder Garth
Haman will deal with you! [kicks him again]
Kenny
(Ow!)
The camp. The Squirts have finished the pillar, with Ike at the very top. Ike gets the key and the pillar falls apart to form two rows of four Squirts each, and Ike alone at the top of the steps. He jumps up to the padlock and unlocks it. He then removes the lock. The door opens and everyone inside pours out. Elder Harris moves out into the open
Elder Harris
Oh, no. It's too late!
Elder Garth
Ramek shtud! [lightning strikes the ground. Nearby, the bear returns and gets the conch shell. She moves away, only to take it to Kenny, who receives it. The bear growls and leaves. Meteors continue to shower down as a black cloud with a pair of red eyes appears among the gathering clouds]
Kyle
What is that?
Elder Schwartz
It is Haman.
Elder Garth
Yes! Yes! [Kenny tries to break the conch shell open on a rock, then against the tree, but it doesn't break]
Haman
Free! Free to punish those that imprisoned me!
Elder Garth
[now prostrate before Haman] Haman! It's me, Garth! I freed you!
Kyle
Look! [Kenny comes into the clearing and throws the shell against the snow several times.]
Kenny
(It's okay, I'll use my head!) [faces the shell and throws his head back]
Kyle
Kenny! Noooooo!
Kenny
(Heeeeeyah! Ugh--!) [the headbutt opened the shell alright, but Kenny falls back on his side as Moses comes out of the broken shell]
Haman
Moses! Nooo!
Elder Garth
Nooo! Eheh. Nooo! [Moses rises into the sky, absorbs Haman, and reclaims his place above the campfire. Elder Garth turns to face him again] Moses. Uh I, I apologize for any inconvenience, eheh. Uh yuh you see, I was just uh--
Moses
Die! [lightning comes out of both his eyes and nukes Garth until Garth explodes]
Elder Garth
No! Aaagghhh! Ooww..! [poof]
All
[gathering] Hooray!
Kyle
Kenny! [runs to Kenny, who now lies in a pool of blood. The others follow]
Elder Harris
That blow to his head must have killed him.
Elder Carn
He saved us. He saved all the Jews.
Kyle
You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
Elder Harris
We've learned a lot from you and your great friend, Kenny.
Moses
[joins them next to Kenny] Every year we shall gather here in this special place and bring Kenny tidings of soap sculptures and macaroni pictures.
Elder Harris
Yes.
Moses
And those little shaker things where... you put beans inside of paper plates that are glued together.
Elder Harris
Paper-plate bean shakers.
Moses
And let us put patterns of glue on the outside of those paper plates so we can then pour glitter on them so they can look nice and sparkly.
Elder Schwartz
You heard him, Scouts! Let's get to work!
End of Jewbilee

Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery
A bustling scene on a dock. A large lake is behind the dock, a stage is off to the left, and the whole place is being dressed for Halloween. Beyond the lake, a lighthouse looks over the scene. At center is a booth for a radio station. The camera moves in
DJ
[with classic 1970's big hair] We're here live at the KOZY 102.1 Halloween Haunt at the South Park docks! Come on down! We've got a haunted house [Chef finished pinning a banner on the top right corner of the stage] and everyone is decorating for tomorrow night, [one man pins a rubber bat to a shack roof, another walks past with a jack-o-lantern] HALLOWEEN, when the band KoRn, that's right, KoRn, is going to play live! And don't forget to wear a costume tomorrow, because there's a big first prize! Why, here's some kids enjoying the Halloween Haunt now! [Kenny, Kyle, and Stan walk past, but turn to face the DJ] Say boys, what do you think of KOZY-FM's Halloween Haunt so far? [lowers the boom mic to Stan]
Stan
This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. [turns and walks away with Kyle and Kenny]
DJ
Uh-hall right! Well, enjoy the spooky docks, kids.
Further down the dock. The boys keep walking, and Cartman runs up to meet them
Cartman
Hey you guys! [they stop] You know what time of year it is?
Kyle
Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
Cartman
That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—
Stan
Christmas?
Cartman
—Christmastime is presents for me.
On another part of the dock, Jimbo and Ned leave a ticket booth
Jimbo
Aw, nuts! Come on, Ned, this ain't no whore house, it's a hor-ROR house.
Guests in line
Awwww! [all leave. The boys walk by]
Cartman
Eeyyy [Kyle stops, the others walk away], Spooky Laboratory, you guys. ["THIS WAY TO SPOOKY LABORATORY" The entrance doors are stained with blood]
Kyle
[annoyed] Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
Cartman
Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory! [throws open the doors and enters] Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
Guide
Welcome to Spooky Laboratory. [pulls out a blindfold and puts it over Cartman's eyes] I'm your guide, Dr. Spookalot. Allow me to show around the lab. [leads him to a table on which is a bowl of eggs and a bowl of lime Jell-o cubes]
Cartman
Cool!
Dr. Spookalot
[helps him up to a chair] Here I have a bowl of human eyeballs.
Cartman
[rolls his fingers around the eggs] Ewww-hoohooo.
Dr. Spookalot
[switches bowls] And here you can feel the brains.
Cartman
[rolls his fingers through the lime Jell-o cubes] Oh-HO, grohoss.
Dr. Spookalot
[leads him to an ass] And here you can feel the warm innards of the body [Cartman reaches into the ass's ass and the ass looks surprised]
Cartman
Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk past a shack on which hangs a banner: "COSTUME CONTEST TOMORROW"
Kenny
(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)
Kyle
[two older boys peek out from behind some boxes, then drop down] Give it up, Kenny! You're not gonna win that costume contest! Your costumes always suck. [the boy with his picture on the shirt pops out and faces them]
Boy in Green Shirt
BOO!
Stan, Kyle, Kenny
Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
Boy in Green Shirt
Ha ha ha ha ha! We scared you, chickens!
Stan
W-we weren't scared!
Boy in Green Shirt
Oh no? Well, you should be! [walks towards them] The pirate ghosts are gonna come getcha!
Kyle
The what?
Boy in Green Shirt
Didn't you know? There's an old legend in South Park that says these docks are haunted by pirate ghosts.
Kyle
Nuh-uh.
Boy in Green Shirt
Yuh-huh. They roam these docks with their swords and hook-hands [molds his left hand into a hook] looking for victims tuh... [swipes it through the air] cut up!
Kenny
[Kyle gasps] (Hoh!)
Stan
That's just an old legend.
Pirate Ghost cutout
[pops up] Rar!
Stan, Kyle, Kenny
Aaaaah! [they turn and run around in circles]
Boy in Green Shirt
[the cutout drops to reveal another friend] Ha ha ha ha, gotcha again, heh ha ha! [both his friends flank him now] Just wait till tomorrow! We're gonna scare you kids to death! Ha ha ha haa! [the three move away]
Cartman
[arrives] You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. [starts sniffing it]
Stan
I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
Kyle
Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
The KOZY-FM booth. The DJ is joined by the town's priest
DJ
Joining me now is Father Maxi, from the South Park Church. Father, what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks?
Priest Maxi
Halloween is an abomination of God! A celebration of the occult-eh!
DJ
Yeah, and how about KoRn playing the big concert tomorrow? Pretty exciting, huh?
Priest Maxi
KoRn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music! If we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays, we may incur the full wrath of evil!
DJ
Alriight, we'll see you tomorrow for Halloween! In the meantime [suddenly soft] here's a KOZY hit by Barry Manilow.
The lake. The boys are still on the docks...
Stan
Come on, you guys, think! How can we scare the fifth graders? It has to be something reeaally scary.
Cartman
We could get a big scary plastic spider, and dangle it in front of them on a string... s- spooky spider, that's pretty scary.
Kyle
That's not scary, fatass!
Stan
Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! [all turn left and walk off. As they walk towards the shore, they pass a shack. After they pass, three pirate ghosts peek out from behind the shack, scowling]
Pirate Ghosts
Darrrr!
The woods. A van rumbles down a road. On the side it reads, "KoRn." Several men inside it talk
Jonathan
Are you sure we're goin' the right way?
David
I don't know. This map doesn't make any sense.
Head
That's because you've got it upside down, chowderhead! [canned laughter]
David
[spins the map around and realizes his error] Oops.
Fieldy
When are we gonna get to the gig? I'm starving.
Jonathan
Don't think about it. We'll just keep playing our game. Ready? I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter T!
Munky
I know! A t-ree!
Jonathan
You've got it. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter R.
David
A road?
Jonathan
That's it! [they pass the South Park Docks sign, and then the three pirate ghosts show up to watch]
Pirates
Darrrr!
further down the road...
Jonathan
Okay, here's one. I spy with my little eye something that begins with the letter P.
Head
The letter P?
Fieldy
What the heck starts with the letter P?
Jonathan
[trembling] Puh-pirate ghosts! [the ghosts appear in front of the van]
All
Aaaaah! [the van swerves left to avoid the ghosts, but ends up going over a hillside. It finally settles upside down at the foot of the hill]
The Cartman house. Cartman walks towards the sofa with a catalog in hand
Cartman
Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay [sits on the sofa], let's see. [softly] I waant... thiis... aand... this... [a truck] and... [flips the page] let's see, comes with so... [the Phillip doll. The doorbell rings] ...comes with two bars [circles the boxed doll], so there we go, have that... [a door opens in the background] and, let's see...
Liane
[walks up to him] Eric, your little friends are here.
Cartman
[excited, motions with the catalog] Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?
Liane
E-heric, it's only Halloween.
Cartman
That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
Stan
[walks up with Kyle and Kenny] Come on, fatass, we have to go!
Cartman
Ey! Don't call me fat! [Liane starts to giggle. Cartman is hurt] Mom, don't laugh.
Liane
I'm sorry, hon,
Cartman
[to his friends] I can't go with you guys right now.
Stan
Yes you can, porky. [Liane giggles again]
Cartman
Mom, seriously! [her giggles die down]
Liane
Oh, that's not funny, boys. Eric isn't fat, he's big-boned.
Kyle
He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. [Liane bursts out laughing]
Cartman
God-damnit, mom!
Outside, night. The boys head out and away
Cartman
[closes the door] God, I hate you guys!
Stan
Okay, so we figured out how to scare the fifth graders.
Cartman
How?
Stan
What's the scariest thing we could get?
Cartman
[quietly] Spooky spider?
Stan
No! [turns, then says gravely] A dead body.
Kyle
Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
Cartman
You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?
Stan
We could never make one that looks real enough. [his voice lowers] To be really scary, it would have to be real.
Kyle
Yeah, fatass, it has to be real to be scary!
Cartman
So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
Stan
[voice low] We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
Kyle
Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up- [stops] Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
Stan
[appeasing] Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
Kyle
Are you insane?!
Cartman
U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Kyle
Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
Stan
All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
Kyle
[uneasy] Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
Stan
Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
Cartman
This is gonna be fun!
The graveyard. Spooky music and a howling wolf punctuate the foggy atmosphere as a full moon rises. Kyle leads the way with a flashlight. Cartman is singing
Cartman
Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-in', ring ting tingle-in' too
Outside it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you, and you, and you.

Stan
Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
Kyle
[shines his light on a tombstone] This must be it. "Cleo Broflovski" That's my grandma. [turns off the light. The boys have a moment of silence]
Stan
Well, let's dig 'er up! [walks to the grave and jabs his shovel in]
Kyle
Wait. I don't know if this is cool.
Stan
Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
Kyle
I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
Cartman
[taunting] "Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!" [Kyle smacks him with the shovel] Ow.
Stan
You guys be quiet! Now, do you wanna get back at the fifth graders or not?!
Kyle
I don't really care, dude.
Stan
Yes you do! Now, dig! [all four begin to dig]
Cartman
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, "You-hoo"...
Later. The casket is now vertical, leaning against the tombstone
Stan
Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three! [they pry the door open, and then jump back and peer in] Whoa, dude.
Kyle
Oh, my God. [the corpse sways to the right, against the casket wall] Hi, ...Grandma.
A voice
Hi, Kyle.
Kyle
[hops back] Aaaah!
Cartman
[providing the voice] Have you been a good boy, Kyle? Have you been making Grandma proud?
Kyle
Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
Stan
[chuckling] Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.
Cartman
Heh heh, I'm sweet.
Kyle
Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
Stan
Okay, grab the sled. [Kenny goes and pulls it up. The others stand aside. When the sled abuts the casket, Cartman pulls at the corpse with his shovel, and it falls forward onto the sled]
The docks. A dog is sniffing at the boards, then raises his head. He growls and runs off stage left. The boys come in from the other side pulling the corpse, and Cartman sings
Cartman
Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...

Stan
Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
Kyle
How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
Cartman
We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: "Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!"
Kyle
Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
Male voice
[off screen] O-o-o-o-oh. [thunderclaps. The boys are afraid.]
Stan
Who was that?
Kyle
Cartman?!
Cartman
It wasn't me! [camera pans to the corpse]
Male voice
Who-o-oa.
Stan
Dude, not cool. This is scary. [Some rustling, and a member of KoRn shows up]
The Boys
Wa-a-a-ah!
Munky
Hey! Like, it's just some kids.
Jonathan
Oh, fwooh, I was really scared there, for a second.
Stan
Hay, you're that band KoRn.
Jonathan
Yeah. I'm Jonathan [with the high forehead], and this is Munky [with chiseled looks], David [with thick eyebrows], Fieldy [short, with white cap], and Head [with dreadlocks]. And over there is our pal, Nibblet. [the mates look around] Hey, where'd Nibblet go?
Nibblet
[a yellow bird with curled antennae and a great wing span ripping into a bag of chips] Uh-huh, Nibblet likes potato chips.
KoRn
Nibblet!
Nibblet
[stops] Okay.
Stan
What are you guys doing out here?
Head
We were just driving our van when all of a sudden we were run off the road by some super-spooky pirate ghosts.
Stan
Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
Kyle
Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
Stan
Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
Jonathan
Oh, swell. We're supposed to play here tomorrow. Do you know where the stage is?
Stan
[points to it] Yeah, dude. It's right over there.
KoRn
O-kay! [they walk away and pass by the priest, who is nailing a post into place: "Halloween is Anti-God." He stops.]
Jonathan
Oh, hi. We're KoRn. We're supposed to play the Halloween concert tomorrow.
Priest Maxi
I know who you are and what you stand for! I think your music and Halloween is an abomination!
Jonathan
Groovy! Could you show us where to set up?
The boys walk a little further, and Cartman pulls the sled over to one side of a stack of boxes
Stan
Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. [Cartman hides the body behind the boxes]
Kyle
Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
Stan
Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! [they start walking away]
Kyle
Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
Kenny
(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
Cartman
Oh, come on, Kenny! You never have a sweet costume! You're not gonna win the costume contest!
Kenny
(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) [The dog returns and sniffs the body from a distance. It approaches slowly, sniffing. Then it lifts the covering and drags the body away.]
The next day. Two uniformed men approach the Broflovski house. One of them rings the bell.
Sheila
Hold on, kids. [grabs the candy bowl next to the door and opens the door with it in hand]
Brunet
Mrs. Broflovski?
Sheila
Yes?
Brunet
We're from Mt. Peaceful Cemetery. Could we have a word with you?
Sheila
Eehh, sure, come in. [they follow her in and sit on the sofa. She takes the armchair, and they look at each other] What is it?
Brunet
Ms. Broflovski... somebody has defiled your mother's grave.
Sheila
Defiled? How?
Blond
Well, I'm afraid that... somebody dug her up.
Sheila
Dug her up? Why??
Brunet
Well. The- most likely reason is that... somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body.
Blond
Yeahp.
Sheila
What?!
Brunet
Uhuh, we don't want to upset you, but it happens. Somebody's probably making love to her corpse as we speak.
Blond
Every vile position, every disrespectful act imaginable.
Sheila
Hoh, dear God!
Brunet
Yes. By now he's probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well.
Sheila
[sadly rubs her eyes] Oooh.
Blond
No-, we don't want to upset you, but you should know that your mother's body would be stiff and dry, so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it.
Sheila
[helplessly] O-o-o-o-oh!
Brunet
Yes. And, now for the difficult part.
Blond
Brace yourself.
Brunet
It is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh, leaving her to look something like — an overloved hunk of Swiss cheese. She probably-
Sheila
Okay, okay! I get the point! Just tell me what you're gonna do about it!
Brunet
...Do?
Blond
Oh, we don't do anything. We're just the watchmen.
Brunet
Yeah, I guess, maybe, you might wanna call the police or something.
Sheila
O-o-ogh! [gets up and walks away. The men just sit there]
Brunet
[to the blond] Now, he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place, so as not to allow further decomposition. [the blond indicates he's thinking by placing his index finger to his lips]
The Cartman house. A delivery man walks towards it with a package and rings the bell. Cartman answers
Delivery Man
Package delivery for Mrs. Cartman?
Cartman
A package? Oh, really? Well, I think I can sign for that!
Delivery Man
Sign heah, and heah, and heah. [Cartman signs and the delivery man goes away. Cartman closes the door and dances with glee]
Cartman
I got a Christmas present! I got a Christmas present! [stops] ...Maybe I can see what it is. I'll just open one little corner. [lifts up a corner of the wrapping] Let's see here. [yanks the wrapping off and away] That's good, I'll rewrap it later! [the box reads, "LIFESIZED Blow-Up ANTONIO BANDERAS LOVE DOLL. WITH REALISTIC GENITALIA"] Oh, sweet! Life-sized blow-up Antonio Banderas love doll! With realistic geni-ta-lia. [takes the doll out] Oh, this kicks ass! What a cool Christmas present my mom got! [blows it up through the penis]
The lake. The docks are bustling again, and the DJ is in his booth
DJ
It's Halloween day, so come on down to the docks and bring your costumes! [a ghost and Ultraman walk by while a joker stands next to the boxes. Stan and Kyle are nearby in their costumes]
Stan
[a cowboy sheriff in white] Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. [Kyle is a clown in a yellow jacket]
Cartman
[walks up with the doll and jingles] Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
Stan
Where's your costume, fatass?
Cartman
Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like "Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!" [heavy machinery is heard, and the boys look up to see an ED-209 unit walking towards them. It stops, turns, and settles into place]
Stan
Hey, Kenny.
Kenny
(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
Cartman
U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
Stan
[rushes his friends along] Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma! [Cartman goes for the sled] This is gonna be sweet
Cartman
[pulls out the sled, but the body is gone] Uuh, problem, guys.
Stan
What's the problem?
Cartman
Nno Grandma.
Kyle
No Grandma??
Cartman
Nno Grandma.
Kyle
[turns and reaches the sled. Stan turns as well] She's not here!
Stan
She has to be here! [Kenny meanders]
Kyle
Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
City Hall, outside. Officer Barbrady stands behind a podium addressing the crowd
Barbrady
Okay, people. I know we all want to get down to the docks for the Halloween Haunt, but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them. Gentlemen? [leaves. The watchmen step up]
Brunet
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. A person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac. So that you all know what to expect, my partner Alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like. [Alan shows the sketch]
Crowd
Ee-oooh!
Brunet
Yes, we know it's horrible. It's probably best you not look at it. Now, Alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like. [Alan pulls out a jar of mayonnaise and jams his fist into it, proceeding to simulate the act. He begins to look surprised at what he's doing as his arm gets covered with mayonnaise]
Crowd
Awwwgh! [Alan continues]
Man
Excuse me, how is this helping?
Barbrady
That's it, folks. Now, we can all go to the docks and enjoy the Halloween Haunt.
Pirate voice
Noo! Don't go to the docks! [the camera looks up to see a pirate ghost floating outside the Mayor's office] Aarrrgh! [the crowd gasps and screams] Argh, I'm Captain Bly! You land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks! Or else, there'll be hell to pay! [the crowd is afraid. Women scream] Fire the cannon! [a pirate ship appears high above the road, and a cannon goes off. The ball lands amid the crowd and leaves a crater. Bodies are strewn all over] Har harharharhar! [the crowd disperses. A couple runs into another pirate ghost]
Pirate Ghost 2
Arrrgh! [slices their heads off with his sword]
Captain Bly
We won't warn ya again! Stay away from our docks! [the pirates and their ship disappear]
Priest Maxi
[rushed to the podium] I warned you! I told you this would happen! [survivors sit up and begin to look his way] When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get!
The docks. KoRn is practicing on stage.
Jonathan
Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let's practice one more time before the show starts.
DJ
Aah, guys, I'm sorry, but the Halloween Haunt's been cancelled.
Jonathan
Cancelled?
DJ
You best clear out of here! There's pirate ghosts, and they'll kill you. [leaves]
Jonathan
Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up.
The Others
Awww. [Stan and friends walk towards the stage]
Kyle
God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
Munky
Oh, hey! The kids from last night.
Head
Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll? [Kenny catches up with his friends]
David
Hey, Kenny.
Kenny
[frustrated] (Aw, man!) [he can't impress anyone]
Jonathan
Say, what's the matter? You kids look kind of glum.
Kyle
Somebody took my dead grandma.
Fieldy
What?
Stan
We dug her up 'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.
Kyle
Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. [starts to sob]
Fieldy
Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry.
Jonathan
Well, that does it. Somethin' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts.
David
They're not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they're ghost pirates.
Jonathan
Huh?
David
"Pirate ghost" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate.
Munky
No, David. Then they are pirate ghosts, because they're the ghosts of pirates.
Fieldy
You're wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.
Jonathan
But that makes them pirate ghosts.
David
No. It makes them ghost pirates.
Munky
Pirate ghosts!
Head
Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Don't you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.
Jonathan
Pirate ghosts.
Kyle
Then, you'll help us?
Jonathan
Sure, we'll help you. If there's one thing we like more than playing music, it's solvin' a groovy mystery.
The Boys
Al-right!
City Hall. People are still laying on floor. Chef arrives
Chef
Is everybody okay?
Sheila
[people gather around Chef] People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?
Gerald
I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.
Mr. Garrison
He's right! Nothin' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.
Sharon
Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!
Crowd
Yeah! [various exclamations follow]
Randy
Lynch mob! [torches and pitch forks appear and the crowd begins to move]
Man
Down with KoRn!
Halloween night, the docks. KoRn and the boys are still talking...
Jonathan
So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.
Kyle
Right. [Kenny walks along the shore way in the background]
Stan
Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
Jonathan
Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues.
Stan
How should we split up?
Jonathan
I know. Let's have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way, [points to his right] and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way. [points to his left]
KoRn
O-kay! [the groups separates in two. In the secure group are Stan, Kyle, Jonathan, Munky, and Fieldy. In the insecure group are Cartman, Kenny, David, and Head]
Kyle
Wow! That was easy.
The lynch mob reaches the docks and head for the van. Randy reaches it first.
Randy
[excitedly] Here's their van! Here's their van!
Woman
Let's flip it over!
Some Folks
Yeah!
Barbrady
[moves to intervene] Okay, people, let's try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top. [the crowd moves in and starts pushing. Even Barbrady participates]
Man
Devil worshipers! [the van tips over]
Crowd
Yeah!
Man 2
Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!
A warehouse. The secure group walks along with Nibblet. Munky is not with them.
Stan
This place gives me the creeps.
Jonathan
Say, this looks like a clue. [picks up a book: "Pirate Lore of South Park, By A.R.R. Robbins"] "Pirate Lore of South Park." Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates? [something metallic falls]
Kyle
Whoa. What was that?
Jonathan
The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody! [opens a door and goes in. The rest follow]
Fieldy
[runs into a supporting pole] Oh, no! I lost my glasses.
The insecure group walks in a darkened part of the warehouse. Munky is in that group now.
Head
What does this dead grandma look like?
Cartman
Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
David
Hey, I got an idea. [all stop] We should set a groovy trap.
Munky
Good idea.
Cartman
How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
David
We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll.
Cartman
[holds the doll tight] Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!
Munky
Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio.
The lit side of the warehouse. Fieldy is still looking for his glasses
Fieldy
My glasses gotta be around here somewhere. [a peg-legged pirate ghost appears next to him] Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I'm glad to see you. I lost my glasses.
Peg-leg
Raaarrrgh!
Fieldy
Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?
Peg-leg
Raarraarrgh! [canned laughter]
Fieldy
Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one! [more canned laughter]
Jonathan
[from the other end of the room] Fieldy, what are you doing?!
Fieldy
[turns to face him] Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you're over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you're actually a...
All
Puh-puuhh pirate ghost! [all scatter]
Peg-leg
Raaarrrgh!
The darkened part of the warehouse. The trap is set
David
Okay. Here's how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas. [the camera now follows the trap as David describes it] When they hit the super-slippery floor, they'll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.
Cartman
Wow, cool!
Munky
Hey! Somebody's coming. [everyone jumps back behind some boxes]
Secure Group
Aaaaah!
Stan
We've got to hide!
Jonathan
Hey, there's Antonio Banderas! He'll help us. [calls out] Mr. Banderas!
David
[peeks up] Jonathan, no!
Secure group
[hits the slick] Aaaah! [the trap works exactly as David said it would]
Head
Oh, no!
Secure group
Aaaah! [the cart hits the wall and stops. The insecure group rushes in]
Stan
Ow!
David
Hold on, guys! [the lynch mob, led by the watchmen, bursts through the doors and moves in on the group]
Brunet
Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town! [the pirate ghosts appear]
Pirate Ghosts
Aarrrrgh.
Crowd
[frightened] Aaaaaah!
Randy
KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
Crowd
[shrieking] Aaaaaah!
Jonathan
[to his band mates] Alright, gang. Looks like we're gonna have to use our special KoRn powers. [the five members huddle and link hands to forearms] KoRn powers, vitalize! [starbursts abound as each member transforms]
Munky
Munky!
David
David!
Fieldy
Fieldy!
Head
Head!
Jonathan
Jonathan!
KoRn
Form of... CORN! [final starbursts give way to various corn products: two corncobs, a tub of popcorn, a can of creamed corn, and one corn kernel. The tub of popcorn swells and spits out several popped kernels. The townsfolk just stare and the corn products stay still. The pirates are seen staring. Soon, the products revert to the band mates]
Jonathan
Alright! Great job, gang! [The townsfolk stare]
Cartman
That didn't help at all.
Head
We know. It's just cool to do.
Pirate Ghosts
Aarrrrgh!
Nibblet
[floating up to release the net] Nibblet! [releases the net, and it lands on the pirate ghosts]
KoRn
[grateful] Nibblet!
Barbrady
What the hell is that thing??
David
You did it, Nibblet! You trapped them!
Jonathan
[approaches the net] Yeah. And now let's see who these pirate ghosts really are! [the ghosts disappear, and he throws his palms up] Oh, I guess they really were pirate ghosts.
Barbrady
[approaches with gun drawn] Alright, KoRn, you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me!
Nibblet
[notices some twine hanging from two trap doors on the ceiling] Hehey, look what Nibblet sees. [pulls on the twine, and the doors open. Priest Maxi falls to the ground]
Priest Maxi
Whoa! [lands with a thud]
Chef
What the...?
Man
Father Maxi?
Priest Maxi
[gets up] Well, what are you waiting for, Barbrady?! Arrest that band!
Barbrady
Oh?
Jonathan
No! Arrest him!
Mob
Huh??
Jonathan
I think I've got this groovy mystery solved!
Outside. The mystery has apparently been explained. The priest is now under arrest
Chef
Well, I must say I still don't get this at all.
Jonathan
It's simple. Priest Maxi didn't want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks.
David
Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts. [shows the flashlight and swabs, then shines the light through the swabs. The pirate ghosts appear in the distance]
Fieldy
[with some cheese and a cup] Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese. [holds them to his mouth and sounds] Aaaaraargh!
Jonathan
And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels. [genuflects to place the candle between the mirror and the squirrels. A pirate ship appears on the lake]
Chef
Father, why did you go to all this trouble?
Priest Maxi
Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!
Chef
Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?
Brunet
Don't you see that by trying to stop Halloween you've scared the hell out of everybody?
Priest Maxi
No.
Barbrady
Okay buddy, you can explain downtown! [takes the priest away]
Sheila
Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn't explain what happened to my mother's body!
Kyle
Yeah! Where's Grandma? [the dog walks in and begins regurgitating. First, the head comes out]
Mob
Eeewww! [the rest of the body comes out]
Stan
There she is!
Mob
Oooh!
Man
Ho-hoh.
Chef
Well thanks a lot, KoRn! You KoRn powers really came through for us!
Sharon
Yes! We were wrong about you. Will you please play for our Halloween party?
Jonathan
Well, sure. Why the heck not?
Mob
All right! [the pirate cutout is hoisted up on two poles]
Pirate Voice
Raarrrr!
Stan
Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! [the cutout shakes and falls away, revealing Nibblet]
All
Nibblet!
Nibblet
Uh oh!
The stage on the docks. KoRn is preparing for their concert. The mob is spread out in front of the stage. Jonathan takes the mic.
Jonathan
Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we're just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it's easy to perceive somethin' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive.
All
[reflecting] Yeah.
Jonathan
The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin' like this:
And a-one, and-a-two, and a [goes right into "Falling Away From Me." The strobe lights come on, and the crowd looks a little stunned. The fifth graders are at the very front of the crowd, and the body of Grandma Broflovski inches up to them]
Stan
Boo!
Fifth Graders
Aaaah! [they run away]
Stan, Kyle
Sweet! [Nibblet floats up to the Antonio Banderas blow-up doll and punctures it. It deflates, alerting Cartman]
Cartman
Antonio, no! [sees Nibblet and goes after it] You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! [KoRn continues playing. At another part of the docks, Mr. Garrison holds court over the Halloween Costume Contest. Kenny is present]
Mr. Garrison
And the winner of the costume contest is [reads the name] Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! Come on up, Wendy. [she rushes up and stands next to him]
Kenny
[droops] (Awww.)
End of KORN's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery... Wait a minute! Dejected, Kenny walks away slowly from the crowd. A tiny snowspeeder flies by and wraps a cable around his costume's legs. He begins to stumble
Kenny
(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) [two more speeders fly by and bomb him to bits, and rats converge on him.]
End of Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery

Chinpokomon
Cartman residence, day. Cartman is watching TV and snacking on something. Kitty walks up
Kitty
Reowr.
Cartman
No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
Kitty
Reowr.
Cartman
No, Kitty! [the TV screen shows a blond Ash-like figure surrounded by three little monsters]
"Ash"
Someday, I will collect all the Chinpokomon, then I will fight the Evil Power that will reveal itself once all the Chinpokomon are collectable, [tilts his head to one side] oh?
Kitty
Roar?
Cartman
[affecting an anime look] No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?
Announcer
Be sure to tune in tomorrow for another inexplicable episode of... Chinpokomon.
Cartman
[exults] Hooray! [hops off the sofa and begins to walk away...]
Announcer
Hey kids! [Cartman turns to look at the TV] Do you love Chinpokomon?
Cartman
Yes.
Announcer
Well, now you can buy your very own! [the little monsters begin to flash across the screen]
Singer
I got to buy Chinpokomon
I got to buy it, I got to buy it! [six Chinpokomon appear]

Announcer
[more Chinpokomon appear...] Now you can collect them all. Furrycat, Donkeytron, Pengin, Shoe, Lambtor. Collect them all, and you can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
Cartman
Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
Announcer
All the Chinpokomon are in stores now.
Japanese Woman
[dressed in business attire] Chinpokomon is soo-peh-rior rubbeh toy, Nuhmbah 1!
Singer
I got to buy it! Chinpo-ko-mon!

Cartman
[turns off TV and rushes to the kitchen, tossing the chicken tenders away] Mom! Mom!
Kitchen. Liane is at the sink. Cartman rushes in and runs circles around her legs
Cartman
[pants] Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!
Liane
Eric, calm down. [genuflects and restrains him]
Cartman
Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
Liane
What is it, Eric?
Cartman
[breathless] Muh-Mom, I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store.
Liane
[stands up and turns to the counter] I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric.
Cartman
[stops] ...But Mo-o-om, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.
Liane
Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?
Cartman
[shriek] ...But Mo-o-om, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!
Liane
Alright! let's go. [heads towards the front door. Cartman follows]
Cartman
Sweet.
Toy store, "TOYS." Cartman and Liane approach it
Cartman
Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. [Liane opens the door, and both are shocked to find the store full of kids looking around and walking with Chinpokomon dolls. The class is there...]
Butters
Wuh-I love Chinpokomon.
Girl
[amid the din] Give it to me!
Boy
Give it here!
Boy
[fighting with Bradley Biggle over a Chinpokomon doll] Give me that!
Cartman
Oh, god damnit! [walks in and runs into Stan]
Stan
Hey, fat ass.
Cartman
Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too.
Stan
Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.
Cartman
Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest. [walks to the Pengin canister and finds it empty] God damnit, there's no more Pengins! [Kenny walks over with one] Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. [starts pulling]
Kenny
(Nuh uh.) [pulls back. Tug-of-war]
Cartman
C'mon.
Kenny
(Nuh uh!)
Cartman
C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--
Kenny
(No!)
Cartman
C'mon.
Kenny
(No!)
Cartman
C'mon. Give me Pengin!
Kenny
(No! This is mine!)
Cartman
C'mon!
Checkout counter. Sharon is ready to pay for some Chinpokomon. Liane has one, too. Sharon turns to Liane
Sharon
Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things.
Liane
They're so strange. Where are they from?
Cashier
Well, it's some new big thing from Japan. I tell you, those Japanese really know how to market to kids.
"Ash"
[on a TV screen] I've got to collect all Chinpokomon. I've got to collect them all so I can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master, oooh? [static]
Japanese woman
Own-ah Chinpokomon, and-ah you vill-ah have-ah happy feelings-eh. [static]
"Ash"
I have to become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
Kids
[recite as they disperse] Must collect Chinpokomon.
South Park, next day. The boys stand around with their Chinpokomon. Kyle is missing
Cartman
Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.
Kenny
(Fuck you!)
Cartman
God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
Kyle
[arrives] Hey dudes. [notices] What are those?
Stan
What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
Kyle
Huh?
Cartman
[haltingly] You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.
Kyle
No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
Cartman
Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.
Stan
Yeah, like ancient history.
Kyle
Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
Stan
No, dude!
Cartman
Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
Kyle
Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
Cartman
It's all Chinpokomon now.
Stan
Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
Kyle
What's the Primary Main Objective?
Cartman
You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
Stan
The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
Kyle
Well, what's the Evil Power?
Stan
[exasperated] Ogh..!
Cartman
[exasperated] Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Duhhh!
Stan
Yeah, get with the times, dude. [turns and walks away with Cartman and Kenny]
Cartman
Duhhh!
Kyle
[throws down Cyborg Bill] Shit!
Broflovski residence. Sheila and Gerald are talking on the sofa. Ike sits to Gerald's left
Gerald
Yeah, I guess so.
Kyle
[enters] Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
Sheila
What's a Chinpokomon?
Kyle
I'm not sure.
Sheila
Well, why do you need one?
Kyle
I don't know.
Sheila
...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll.
Kyle
Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
Gerald
Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something.
Ike
Neah Kyle doh.
Gerald
You see, son, fads come and go. And this "Chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, "I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual." Do you understand?
Kyle
Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
Gerald
Hm... Good point; here's $10. [hands it to him]
Kyle
Thanks.
Gerald
Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. [Kyle receives the other $10 and walks out]
Ike
Hey, Chih-paw-ko.
Toy store. Kyle has just purchased a Lambtor
Cashier
[hands him the doll] There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things.
Kyle
Neither do I. [turns and walks out.]
Cashier
[closes the door and turns off the lights] I guess I'll call it a night. [heads towards the back]
A voice
Chinpoko! [the cashier turns] Buy me! Buy me! [the cashier heads for the Chinpokomon display] When will you become Royal Chinpoko Master? [the cashier gets a Lambtor and squeezes it, making a little squeak.] Hurry up and buy me. [squeeze] Down with America!
Cashier
What? [squeeze]
Lambtron
I love you. Let's be best friends, and destroy the capitalistic American government.
Cashier
What the hell is goin' on here?
Cartman residence, next day. The boys are engaged in a video game. Again, Kyle is absent
Kyle
[enters] Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
Cartman
Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
Kyle
What?
Stan
Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
Kyle
[a little lost] Huh? No.
Cartman
[haltingly] Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! [Cartman presses "START" on game controller]
Announcer
Chinpokomon, what is Primary Objective?
Stan/Kenny/ Cartman
To destroy the Evil Power!
"Ash"
I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power, oooh?
Stan/Kenny/ Cartman
Oooh?
Kyle
Damnit! [walks out]
"Ash"
I've got to buy them all, so first I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor.
Japanese woman
[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! Deddy? [vanishes]
"Ash"
Go! ["GO" pops up, and the boys are furiously maneuvering their controllers]
Kenny
(Hey, you guys...) [the boys bomb the harbor, grunting all the while]
"Ash"
I must buy them all! I must buy them all!
Stan/Kenny/ Cartman
We must buy them all! [they finish the first round of bombing and fly away]
Japanese woman
[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! [drops down. The second round begins and the bombing is more intense. Kenny begins to convulse and finally drops off the sofa. Play stops as Cartman and Stan look on with shock]
Stan
Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
Cartman
Cool! This game rules!
Japan; Chinpokomon Company, outside. An inside shot looks to the main doors as they open, and one man walks in
Cashier
Hello-o? Ey, hello? [a monitor drops down from above]
Japanese woman
[on screen] Werucome to Chinpokomon Toy Corporashon. Purease state a-name.
Cashier
Rr-Red Harris? I own a toy store in America?
Japanese woman
Purease state the puhpose-uh.
Red
Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls, talkin' about bringin' down American government and all? [the monitor is pulled up in a hurry, and an elevator rises from the floor. The doors open and two men walk towards him.]
Taller man
I am President Hirohito. And-ah, this is Mr. Ose.
Mr. Ose
[nods forward] Peased to meet you.
President Hirohito
We unduhstand you have big concern about our fine pro-duct.
Red
Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about? [squeezes Lambtor]
Lambtor
The American government lies to you! Join the fight for Japanese supremacy of the world! More to come. [the two men remain silent]
Red
Well?
Mr. Ose
Uuuh.
President Hirohito
That is so sturange. [takes Lambtor from Red] I do not a-know how this could happen. But urest assured, I will make sure [glares sideways at Mr. Ose] it does not happong again!
Red
Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--
President Hirohito
You are American?
Red
Yes.
President Hirohito
[begins to gesture] Ogh! You must have very big pee-anis!
Red
Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!
President Hirohito
Nothing. We are very simple people. With very small penis. Mr. Ose penis is ...especially small.
Mr. Ose
[fakes a sob] Uh, smuh, so small.
President Hirohito
We cannot achieve much with so small penis. But you! Americans. Wow! Penis so big! Soo big penis!
Red
[flattered] Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size.
Mr. Ose
Minata, kite kite! ["Everone, come come!" A group of Japanese women move in, chattering] This-a man has veh-ry big penis! [the women applaud, Red grins big]
Woman 1
Take takeru o da ne? ["It's rather large, isn't it?"]
Woman 2
Hai. ["Yes."]
Mr. Ose
Uh, hoh, what an-whoa immense penis-uh!
Red
Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now.
President Hirohito
Good-bye. Thank you for stopping by, with your gargantuan penis. [Red walks out humming happily. After a moment Hirohito looks angrily at Mr. Ose] Dame, dame da. ["Bad, this is bad." The women move away quickly. He slaps Mr. Ose] Naze kono chippu wa soto ni detandaba? ["How could you let this chip go out?"]
Mr. Ose
Wa, wakarimasen, sachoo san. Mondai desu nee. ["I, I don't know, boss. That's the problem."]
President Hirohito
Sekinin shoo yobe! ["You're no longer in charge!"]
Mr. Ose
Hai. Hai, sachoo san. ["Yes. Yes, boss." He bows out]
The Cartman house, night. Kitty roars outside. Cartman is asleep, but tossing...
Cartman
I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
His Chinpokomon sends up an antenna, which sends out a signal, which goes out the window and joins other signals at a point in space. Then the merged signals go to a satellite, which bounces them to Japan. The signals reach the Chinpokomon Toy Corporation's rooftop satellite dish and split up to show each Chinpokomon in its own screen on the company's video wall. President Hirohito is talking to his board of directors under heavy guard
President Hirohito
Amerika ni, kodomo zenbu Chinpokomon motte iru. Kore kara, "phase two" hajimete. IKIMASHOO! ["All the children in America own Chinpokomon. We'll begin "phase two" there. LET'S GO!" The soldiers set their rifles] The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!
Marsh residence, next day. A TV is on: "I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon!" Sharon sits on the sofa looking at the cartoon
Randy
[walks up] What are you doing?
Sharon
I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
Randy
Why?
Sharon
Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. [Randy sits]
"Ash"
[addressing a robot rooster] Hey, you must be Roostor! I haven't bought one of you yet, but I'll bet you can transform into Roostallion if you found Diamond Skill 7! [picks it up and squeezes]
Roostor
Roo-oo-oostor! [a teen boy in black body suit emblazoned with an 8 appear]
"Eight"
[does the following as he speaks] Hey, I'm gonna take your Roostor and put it in this bag, where it will flourish or expire, depending on fate!
"Ash"
Hey! Is that a good idea?
"Eight"
Roostors aren't like Chuchunezumis. They haven't the heart for such endeavors.
"Ash"
Oooh? [Randy and Sharon look lost]
Randy
...Are those good moral values?
Sharon
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
Hours later. Randy and Sharon watch a battle scene in disbelief
"Ash"
Lambtron! You are losing the battle of your life! [Lambtron battles Furrycat]
Narrator
But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?
"Ash"
I am sad now, because Lambtron must be very lonely because there are so few Lambtrons in the world. Will he ever find a companion?
Sharon
This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
Randy
I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
Sharon
Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!
Randy
Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.
Sharon
No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation.
Randy
[solemnly] My God, you're right.
South Park, by Tom's Rhinoplasty, day. Cartman is strumming a guitar. A sign on the case reads: "Please HELP...Boys Sent to camp
Cartman
Come on, brothers and sisters
We've all got to join together
Join together and give me money
So I can buy more Chinpokomon!
We've got to stop this fight and...

Stan
[arrives with Kenny] How's it goin', fat ass?
Cartman
I haven't made any money yet.
Stan
What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
Cartman
Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
Stan
We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. [moves Kenny so the glazed eyes can be seen]
Kyle
[rushes up with a new item] I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! [Tthe others look at him and then laugh]
Cartman
Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!
Stan
Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
Kyle
Camp?
Cartman
[sighs] The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
Stan
You didn't know that?
Kyle
[quickly saving face] No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? [turns and walks away]
Stan
Dude, did you just say "a-ight"?
Kyle
[turns back] Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
Cartman
Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!
Stan
Yeah, dude. Nobody says "a-ight" anymore.
Kyle
What?? "A-ight"'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
Cartman
Like, eight days ago.
Kyle
God damnit! [turns and hurries away]
Marsh residence, night. Living room. The Marshes Broflovskis, Liane, the McCormicks, and the Tweeks watch an Chinpokomon advertisement.
Announcer
Hey, kids! [Furrycat appears] Only one more day till the Chinpokomon camp! ["Ash" and "Eight" appear] Come early and enjoy all the Chinpoko fun! ["Chinpokomon CAMP" is placed over Furrycat, then a violet gorilla appears]
Singer
Chinpokomon Camp!
I've got to buy a ticket!
I've got to buy one! A ticket!
I've got to buy buy buy!

Japanese woman
[pops in from the side] It'sa Satuhday anda Sunday. You can'ta wait to go! [moves out]
Singer
Chinpokomon! [the TV clicks off]

Sharon
We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel.
Liane
Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad.
Sheila
Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did.
Randy
[concerned] Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.
Sheila
Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them.
Sharon
You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it.
Sheila
Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?
Chinpokomon camp. A huge temple looms over the crowd of kids. Three huge screens display the Chinpokomon program. Soldiers guard the screens and the central stairway. Stan and friends move through the crowd. Several classmates are already there
Cartman
Get outta the way! Move it!
Stan
Can you see anything? [the gorilla Chinpokomon appears onscreen]
Kids
Yay!!! [applause]
Stan
It's starting, it's starting!
Singer
I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon! [the kids continue to cheer and clap. Mr. Ose takes center stage]

Mr. Ose
Attention! Attention! [the kids quiet down] This isa Chinpokomon Camp!
Kids
Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts!
Kyle
...our hearts. [looks left] Kenny? [Kenny stands motionless]
Mr. Ose
What is the Primary Main Objective?
Kids
To destroy the Evil Power!
Kyle
...Power.
Mr. Ose
Yesuh. Anda what is the Evil Power? [no one answers] The Evil Power is the United States gorvernment! [the three screens display the U.S. flag. The kids stay silent]
Cartman
Ohhh.
Mr. Ose
United Statesuh government is the Evil Power! It hasa taken Japanese Americans! It hasa broken Japanese spirit! And what do Chinpoko Masters do to Evil Power?!
Kids
Destroy it!
Kyle
Destroy it?
Mr. Ose
That isa correct! Now, it isa great honor to present... your Chinpoko Leaduh! Emperor Hirohito! [a gong is heard, and Mr. Ose claps a few times]
Emperor Hirohito
[President Hirohito in shogun attire takes center stage] Welcome to campu. Whoever passes it knows and honors that the greatness of Japan is in its history, and it is based on that history that we shall again rise to the dominant world powuh!
Cartman
Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
Emperor Hirohito
It is again time for the Rising Sun to sit tall in the sight! One Japan! One society! [walks off. Mr. Ose claps and takes the mike]
Mr. Ose
We will begin witha language anda exercise skills. Hajimete!! ["Begin!" Two instructors walk up]
Instructors
[doing squats] Ichi, ni, san, shi! ["1, 2, 3, 4!"]
Kids
Ichi, ni, san, shi! Ichi, ni, san, shi! ["1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4!"]
South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class. The kids are chatting away happily in Japanese. All have anime expressions
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, I want it quiet! [the class shuts up] Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is six times three?
Stan
Juuhachi desu ka? ["Isn't it eighteen?"]
Class
Juuhachi da nee! ["Eighteen it is!"]
Mr. Garrison
No, goddammit, it's eighteen!!
Stan
Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san.
Mr. Garrison
For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!
Cartman
Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana. ["Ooo, Mr. Garrison is such an asshole!"]
Mr. Garrison
What did he say?!
Stan
He said, "Garrison-san sabuchii da naa."
Class
Soo desu nee! ["That's right!"]
Mr. Garrison
Damnit, this is not Japan!!
Cartman
Minata! Kite kite, churi... [farts. The class laughs]
Wendy
Dare ga pu shita no. ["Who farted?"]
Mr. Garrison
Aggghhh! [rushes out of the room amid the kids' laughter]
City Hall, the Mayor's Office. The parents are gathered in it
Mayor
People, please! We can only speak one at a time. Now, Mr. Garrison, you were saying...
Mr. Garrison
I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp.
Sharon
[Randy holds her] My son hasn't made any sense in days.
Priest Maxi
I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow!
Mayor
Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? [Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose step up]
President Hirohito
We at the Japan Toy Company are vetty cohncerned about-a your cohncerns. That is why we make Chinpokomon camp.
Randy
Well, how is it good?! We don't understand what the point of your product is!
President Hirohito
There is nothing to worry about. We at Japan Toy Company are in awe of your large penis.
Mr. Garrison
What?
President Hirohito
You see, Japanese penis so small. [holds his hands about an inch apart]
Mr. Ose
[set his index finger an inch from his thumb] So-eh small.
President Hirohito
You Americans have such humungous burbous penis.
Mr. Garrison
Well, uh-I guess that's true.
Mr. Ose
Oh, suh-n nice-a big penis American.
President Hirohito
What can we possubruh do with such small penis? We cannot take over your city, filled witha men awith such mastodonic penis.
Jimbo
Huwell, uh he's got a point there.
Randy
Well, I guess that settles that.
Priest Maxi
We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen.
President Hirohito
[bowing with Mr. Ose] Oh, no. Thank you. Another chance to be in same room with big American penis. [exits]
Mr. Ose
Uh-uh, my penis so small. [exits]
Priest Maxi
Nice guys. [the door closes]
City Hall, outside the Mayor's Office
President Hirohito
Jikan ganai. Suberi maratsuba. Sukash. Simenu bi faamo werosii kowai samaneba. ["Time is short. Those people will discover our plan soon. We must finish quickly."]
City Hall, the Mayor's Office. The men and women have split into two groups by gender. Sharon speaks
Sharon
So, what are we going to do about our children? [the men smile down at their crotches] Ahhh, hello-o?
Mayor
O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution.
Liane
You have?
Mayor
Children are fickle. [thump] All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
Sharon
Of course! That's a great idea!
Sheila
But what toy?
South Park Market Research Laboratories, a nondescrpt building. A big-screen TV is shown, flanked by two lab techs. Then a sofa is shown, with Kyle, Stan, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters
Lab Tech 1
Alright, boys, we're going to show you a couple of commercials, and you tell us which toy interests you the most. Now, watch carefully. [the first one comes on]
Announcer
Hey, kids. Do you like Chinpokomon?
Boys
Yeah!
Announcer
Well then, you're gonna go wild for [echo comes on as a weird bike is shown] Wild Wacky Action Bike! [a bike with two single-arm handles, one attached to each wheel, and two lumpy side wheels]
Singer
Wild Wacky Action Bike!
The bike that's hard to ride!

Announcer
[a boy runs to the bike and hops on, trying to figure out how to steer it. He shrugs] Wild Wacky Action Bike is almost impossible to steer. And it glows in the dark.
Singer
Goin' to try to ride all day long, but I'm goin' to fail
'Cause it's Wild Wacky Action Bike!

Boy
[manages to steer it, but runs into some cones] Man... [then steers it well enough down the street]
Singer
You can't ride it, you can't ride it
Wild Wacky Action Bike!

Boy
Aaagg-agh--! [ends up under a truck. A cloud of steam rushes out on impact]
Announcer
Wild Wacky Action Bike comes with everything you see here. [the boys say nothing for a while, then...]
Cartman
...Gay.
Stan
Yeah, dude. That was totally gay.
Lab Tech 1
Ohhh. [writes "GAY" under "Wild Wacky Action Bike" on his "Test Results" pad and underlines it] Wuh-okay, here's the next one.
Announcer
Hey, kids. Do you like Chinpokomon?
Boys
Yeah!
Announcer
Well then, you're gonna love... Alabama Man! ["ALABAMA MAN" over the Confederate flag, then Alabama Man is shown with bowling ball and beer can]
Singer
Alabama Man
He's quick, he's strong, he's active.

Announcer
You can take Alabama Man to the bowling alley, where he drinks heavily and chews tobacco. [A little bowling alley is shown, with Alabama Man standing on a platform that connects to the alley by a ramp. Behind that sits a woman doll keeping score]
Boy 1
[watching Alabama Man swing a bowling ball] Wow! He can bowl. [presses a button, releasing the bowling ball. It goes down the bowling alley and knocks six pins down]
Singer
He can bowl, he can drink, he can drink and bowl
Alaba-ma Man!

Announcer
When his wife asks him where he's been, just use the action button, [Alabama Man is made to knock her down] and Alabama Man busts her lip open.
Boy 1
[with Alabama Man. Boy 2 has his wife] Shut up, bitch! [has Alabama Man knock his wife down]
Boy 2
Wow!
Singer
He beat the wife and sleeps it off
Alabama Man!

Boys 1/2
I wanna be just like Alabama Man.
Announcer
Alabama Man comes with everything you see here. Wife sold separately.
Boy 2
I thought I told you to shut up! [has Alabama Man knock his wife down with a backhand]
Announcer
Not all people from Alabama are wife-beaters. [Again, the boys stay silent]
Cartman
Gay.
Stan
Totally gay.
Kyle
Liberace gay.
Lab Tech 1
[writes "GAY" under "Alabama Man" and underlines it twice] Oooh, dear. Well, let's keep trying. How about this? [cuts into an actual commercial...]
South Park, next weekend. The adults are lined up on either side of Main Street as Mr. Ose leads the kids through the town. Japanese flags, a poster of President Hirohito, and red flags are being paraded
Mr. Ose

Sharon
[pleading] Stan, please, come home!
Stan
Kore wa watashi no uchi desu. ["This is my home now."]
Kids
So desu née. ["That's right."]
Mr. Ose
Ooh? [resumes his position. Sharon looks betrayed] Do not worry. Everything isa okay.
Sharon
No, it's not okay!
Mr. Ose
Oh, but-a you have-a such large penis-uh. [behind him, Stan has a fierce expression on his face]
Sharon
What?
Mr. Ose
Your penis, wooww-- [President Hirohito walks up and slaps him] O-oh..!
President Hirohito
What he means is that all men in this town have very large penis. [all the men smile at the compliment]
Sharon
Can't you see what's happening?! They're just using that talk to distract you! He doesn't really have a small penis!
President Hirohito
Misenasai! ["Show them!" Mr. Ose takes down his pants. The people are shocked, and he pulls them up again.]
Sharon
Oh! [the march resumes]
Mr. Ose
Owatta! ["Down with "]

Gerald
Oh God, is there nothing we can do?
Sharon
[turns to face the adults] Wait a minute... Wait a minute, I think I know the answer! I know how to get our kids to stop liking Chinpokomon! [the last of the troops leaves]
Sheila
How?
Sharon
Come on! We don't have much time! [leads the adults away]
Washington, D.C.; the White House.
Reporter
And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States.
President Clinton
[from the Oval Office] My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you.
A Japanese military base. Eighteen planes and 39 troops are seen. The kids stand at attention. Kyle is missing
Mr. Ose
Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arrive you will drop many bombs!
Kids
Hai, sachoo-san. ["Yes, Mr. President." The kids part to the planes. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny run into the adults]
Stan
Nan da kore? ["What's this?"]
Randy
Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo! ["We're crazy about this Chinpoko stuff." All the adults carry Chinpokomon now]
Stan
What?
Randy
Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
Stan
You like it?
Mr. Garrison
You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
Liane
Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron.
Cartman
Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
President Hirohito
Whar are they doing?!
Mr. Ose
It's a trick!
Randy
Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker. ["MY KID IS A CHINPOKOKID" with a smiling kid's face on the left end, and a Lambtron on the right. Randy walks to it and kneels to display it] Isn't that cool?
Stan
[holding a Chuchunezumi] No. [the adults laugh, and he throws the Chuchunezumi away] Screw this, dude. [starts walking out]
Cartman
Where are you going, Stan?
Stan
Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. [walks away]
Cartman
Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. [follows]
Other kids
Yeah. Me too! Me too. [each one tosses a Chinpokomon onto a pile and leaves the airfield. A Lambtron lands on its side and a kid steps on it. The adults cheer.]
President Hirohito
[grabbing his head in frustrated disbelief] Nooo!!
Randy
Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.
Sharon
That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool. [turns to Mr. Garrison] We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! [he walks over to a telegraph machine and starts spreading the word]
Stan
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
Sharon
You bet, Stanley! [a fighter plane has left its spot and appears before the crowd. Kyle is in the cockpit]
Kyle
Owatta Beikoku! ["Down with the U.S.A.!"] [the adults are stunned]
Sheila
Kyle, it's over!
Kyle
But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
Stan
[flatly] Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore.
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Yeah, dude, that's way over. [a rat is on Kenny, trying to nibble]
Kyle
Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!
Stan
No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused.
Kyle
So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
Stan
...Ye-eah.
Kyle
But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. [moves forward]
Stan
Oh... Wait. [walks with the plane] Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
Kyle
Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. [turns the power off and hops out of the plane. Mr. Garrison walk away]
Randy
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over.
Cartman
[sees rats on Kenny and swats them off] Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!
Bus Stop, next day. The four boys are waiting. The rats return and crawl all over Kenny
Cartman
Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!
Stan
Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
Kyle
Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while.
Cartman
Me, too. [Kenny starts to tremble] I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- [Kenny falls and trembles harder. The others watch]
Stan
What the..? [Kenny's body rips open and a bunch of rats crawl out of him.]
Cartman
Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! [Stan and Kyle laugh as Cartman looks on, the credits play the instrumental theme that played in the Wild Wacky Action Bike & Alabama Man commercials]
Singer
(over the Braniff Airlines logo) Bye bye buh-buh-buh-buh-buh chicken!

End of Chinpokomon

Hooked on Monkey Fonics
The Cartman house, night. Liane brings a box into the dining room.
Liane
[sets the box down on the floor] Eric, Mommy got you a present!
Cartman
[suddenly excited] A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!
Liane
Nnno, I got you something that's going to help you win the big spelling bee tomorrow.
Cartman
[drops and sighs heavily] Mom, I'm not going to win the spelling bee; I never do.
Liane
This year is gonna be different. Look! [places the box on the table] I got you "Hooked On Monkey Fonics." [mom and son look at each other]
Cartman
[after a while] What the hell is "Hooked On Monkey Fonics?"
Liane
It's a new way to learn how to read and spell. And it comes with everything you need to help win that spelling bee. [unpacks the contents: two cassette tapes, a tiny drum set, an owner's manual, and a live monkey. The monkey chatters] It says we just put the cassette into a tape player [does it, and presses the Play button. A glissant plays, and the monkey sits behind the drum set]
Female Voice
Welcome to "Hooked On Monkey Fonics," level 1. I will read the sounds and the monkey will help keep the beat. [Liane smiles] If your monkey arrived in the box dead, call 1-800-555-4500 to get a new monkey. Ready? Let's begin. [glissant. The monkey plays. A little rap follows]
The learning monkey is here to say
That reading is easy and it's okay.[Liane starts swaying like a metronome]
Work with the monkey and you will learn
To spell hard words, like "morbid" and "burn."
Start with Card 1. [Liane holds it up] Ready? Begin! [glissant] C, H. [a "ch" sound] Chalk. [the monkey plays four beats more, then turns to Cartman. One more beat...]

Cartman
[finally responds, keeping the beat] C, H. "Ch." Chalk.

Female Voice
Good. Card 2. [Liane holds it up] T, H. [a hard "th"] There.

Cartman
T, H. "Th." There.

Hey, this is easy! [raps] I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!
South Park, next day. A stage has been set up in front of the rebuilt library, and the adults are there to watch. A banner over it reads: The 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals
On stage, back row, are Wendy, Kevin, Annie, Clyde, Butters and Bebe. In the front row are Token, a new boy, an empty chair, Kyle, Stan, and Cartman. Off to the left, Mr. Mackey will keep score, but doesn't look at all happy about it. The Mayor is front and center
Mayor
All right, everyone. Welcome to the 15th Annual South Park Spelling Bee Finals! [the crowd cheers. The Mayor walks over and stands next to Mr. Mackey. The new boy is gone!] This should be very interesting. We have with us twelve of the brightest spellers from South Park Elementary.
Jimbo
Kyle, Kyle, he's our man. If he can't win it, I'm out 50 bucks.
Gerald
You bet money on my son to win?!
Jimbo
Sure! When it comes to spelling bees, always bet on the Jew.
Cartman
You're going down, bitch!
Kyle
Shut up, fatass! Everyone knows I can spell better than you.
Cartman
Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! [signals something with a thumbs-up. The monkey and drums are next to him, on the floor.]
Mayor
And, joining us this year, are the two home-schooled children, Rebecca and Mark Cotswolds! [they enter...]
Jimbo
What?! [...and take their seats]
Cartman
Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
Jimbo
Ey, that's not fair! You can't let home-schooled kids into a public-school spelling bee!
Kyle
What's a "home-schooled kid"?
Stan
I don't know, dude. I've never seen them before. [the left side of the groups is shown. Mark, the new kid seen earlier, sits next to Token, and Rebecca takes the aisle seat. The others in their section study them.]
The Cotswolds
[cheering] Go, Mark! Go, Rebecca!
Mayor
[reads, then] Our first contestant is Mark Cotswolds, from home school. [he steps on the platform] All right, Mark. Your word is "conscientious."
Cartman
What?! What the fuck that that mean?
Mark
"Conscientious." May I have the definition, please?
Mayor
Closely attentive to details. Careful.
Mark
"Conscientious." Could you use it in a sentence, please?
Mayor
Mary's analysis of the spreadsheet was... conscientious.
Mark
"Conscientious." C O N S C I E N T I O U S.
Cartman
[as the bell rings] Holy crap! [the crowd is stunned]
The Cotswolds
Way to go, Mark! Alright!
Mayor
Okay, our next contestant is Eric Cartman. [he goes to the platform, smiling] Alright, Eric, here's your word: chair. Chaaiirr. [he looks to the monkey, who's minding its own business]
Cartman
Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum! [it looks around] Come on! [it begins to drum something else, getting excited. Cartman looks resigned]
Mayor
Eric, your word is "chair."
Cartman
Uuh. Definition?
Mayor
Something you sit on.
Cartman
Country of origin?
Mayor
English! [the angrier she gets, the more afraid Mr. Mackey looks]
Cartman
Could you please use it in a sentence?
Mayor
Oh, for Christ's sake, kid! The word is "chair"!!
Cartman
Uh- chair. C H A R E [the buzzer sounds and Eric panics] God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?! [races off the stage] Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!
The spelling bee. After several rounds, the other kids are eliminated. The Cotswolds kids and Kyle are the only ones left.
Mayor
All right, we're down to just three finalists. First up is Rebecca Cotswolds from home school. [Rebecca takes the platform, but casts her eyes down and away from the mayor. She nervously taps her hands together] Alright, Rebecca. Here's your word: littoral.
Rebecca
[voice quivering] "Litoral." Deh-finition?
Mayor
Having to do with a lake or ocean.
Rebecca
"Litoral." Will you please use it in a sentence?
Mayor
Gary was most interested in the littoral features of Michigan.
Rebecca
"Littoral." [Before saying each letter, she opens her hands like a book, whispers the letter into them, and closes them] L I T O R A L
Mayo
[sounding the little bell] Correct!
Kyle
[softly] Wow! [he's impressed]
Mr. Cotswolds
[both parents clap] Alright, Rebecca. Good job, honey. [she takes her seat]
Mayor
Now we have Kyle Broflovski. [he takes the platform] Here we go. Krocsyldiphithic.
Kyle
What??
Mayor
Krocsyldiphithic.
Kyle
Definition?
Mayor
Something which has a krocsyldiph-like quality.
Kyle
Uh, could you use it in a sentence?
Mayor
Certainly. "Krocsyldiphithic" is a hard word to spell.
Kyle
"Krocsyldiphic."
Jimbo
You can do it, kid! You can do it!
Kyle
"Krocsyldiphic." C [the buzzer cuts him off] Damnit!
Jimbo
You little bastard, you cost me fifty bucks. [Stuart, Gerald, Randy, and Ned start carrying him away] Why don't you run away and join the circus, you stupid little son of a bitch?! Aaargh!
Mayor
Congratulations, Mark and Rebecca. [hand them their trophies] You are truly South Park's finest. [a print photographer takes a picture]
Stan
[standing before the stage with Cartman and Kenny] Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart.
Cartman
Yeah. Too bad they have the personalities of a wet dishcloth. [the finalists come off the stage and stand in front of it.]
Kyle
[walks up to Rebecca] What's your name? [apparently, he wasn't paying attention...]
Rebecca
Guh what's in a name? [turns and walks away]
Kyle
Wooww.
Mark
It was nice competing against you boys. We will have to do it again sometime.
Cartman
[mocking] Oh, yes. We must do it again.
Stan
We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
Mark
No. I live right over there. [points to a house like any other, but it has bars on its windows] I've lived there all my life.
Cartman
How come you don't go to school?
Mark
Because I'm home-schooled.
Stan
What's that?
Mark
My parent teach me. So I stay at home instead of going to school.
Cartman
You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
Mark
Right.
Cartman
[waxes poetic]
Who would have thought such a miracle could be?
Who could have known that this moment I would see?
A new way of living, a chance to be free?

Stan
Shut up, Cartman?
Cartman
You shut up, [backhand slap] butthole.
Stan
You shut up, [backhand slap] gaywad!
Cartman
You shut up, [backhand slap] ass-logger!
Mark
[astonished] Oh my goodness, are you two enemies?
Stan
No, we're friends.
Mark
Strange, friends would call each other names and fight.
Stan
What?
Mr. Cotswolds
Come, children, let's take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel. [the family walks away. Kyle looks after Rebecca. Mark looks back at the boys.]
Stan
Dude, what a bunch of freakin' nerdos.
The Cotswolds house, night. The family is at dinner
Mark
Papa?
Mr. Cotswolds
Yes, Mark?
Mark
Why can't I go to school with the other boys?
Mrs. Cotswolds
[gasps] Oooh.
Mr. Cotswolds
[leans in on Mark] Well, because, son, public schools are inefficient and dangerous!
Mark
But I want to play with the other children. O, how they laugh and play, Papá.
Mrs. Cotswolds
Mark, you have play time. You get to play in the afternoon.
Mark
I just feel like I should go to public school, if only for a little while. To see what other little boys are like.
Mr. Cotswolds
Mark, public schools are no good! Your mother and I were both home-schooled, and we turned out much better because of it.
Mark
Please, Papá. Just let me try it for a few days.
Mr. Cotswolds
Alright. Fine, Mark! You go ahead and go to public school! You can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is!
Mark
Hooray!
Mr. Cotswolds
You don't want to go to public school too, do you, Rebecca?
Rebecca
[voice quivering] Oh, heavens, no.
Mr. Cotswolds
Well, thank God for that! At least my daughter will remain safe! [the doorbell rings and all look towards it]
Kyle
[Mrs. Cotswolds opens the door] Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?
Mrs. Cotswolds
Yes she is. [doesn't move]
Kyle
...Uuh, can I talk to her?
Mrs. Cotswolds
Oh. Well, I suppose so. Rebecca! [Rebecca walks up] This little boy wants to see you.
Rebecca
[with hands in prayer pose] Huhlo? [Kyle looks a little dismayed, as her tapping of hands is a habit. He looks at her mom for any assistance, but sees none. He looks at Rebecca again]
Kyle
U-u-uh, hi. [puts his hands behind his back]
Rebecca
Hel-lo.
Kyle
Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. [turns and hurries away. Rebecca looks, then goes in. Her mom closes the door]
Mr. Cotswolds
[walks up] Who was that?
Mrs. Cotswolds
A little boy wanted to see Rebecca.
Mr. Cotswolds
[wary] Oh no. I told you the spelling bee was a bad idea.
Mrs. Cotswolds
But the children won, and they were happy to meet the other children.
Mr. Cotswolds
Yes, but now I think we may have opened a Pandora's box that we can't close! [they then stand motionless for a while]
South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison's class. Craig, Butters, and Tweek sit in the front row.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? [A large plastic ball rolls into class, and Mark is inside driving it. He runs into Craig's chair and stops.]
Mark
Hey, guys. What's up?
Cartman
Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
Mr. Garrison
Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America? [Mark and Cartman vie to answer] Ehyes, Mark?
Cartman
Ey! How come you never pick me?!
Mr. Garrison
Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?
Mark
The answer is 1492. However, the Americas had already been discovered by many before him, including the Vikings and the Native Americans. And therefore, your question is a charade.
Cartman
Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!
Mr. Garrison
Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. [every kid looks angrily at Mark.]
Stan
Oh, God. This kid's gonna last about five seconds out on the playground.
Mr. Garrison
Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from? [again, Mark and Cartman vie to answer] Put your hand down, creampuff.
Cartman
That does it! [gets off his seat and moves towards the door] I do not need to sit here and be ridiculed! I'm gonna go be home-schooled from now on!
Stan
You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.
Cartman
I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! [leaves and closes the door]
Mr. Garrison
Oh, please God, let it be forever.
The playground. The recess bell rings and the kids rush out the door. Mark joins them in his huge hamster ball. Beside the jungle gym Stan and Pip stand next to each other, with Bebe and Annie behind them.
Stan
Come on, Pip, say it. Say "Please, hit me."
Pip
But, if I say that, you'll hit me.
Stan
No! I'm gonna hit you if you don't say it. If you say "Please, hit me," I won't hit you.
Pip
Please, hit me.
Stan
All right. [backhand slap]
Pip
Ooowww!
Stan
Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.
Mark
[rolls up] I don't understand. You seem to like that boy, yet hate him at the same time. [Craig and Butters walk up]
Craig
Hey, kid. Get out of that hamster ball.
Mark
Oh. I promised my father I wouldn't.
Stan
Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. [moves out of the way as Craig and Butters position the ball]
Butters
Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
Mark
You mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench? For what purpose?
Craig
Just get out of the hamster ball, or else you're gonna find out!
Mark moves to the door and opens it. The ball moves, and Butters holds in in place while Mark flips his way out of it. Once he's on the ground, a bunch of boys come in and crowd him. Token, Bill, Tweek, Clyde, and Terrence join Craig and Butters in carrying Mark to the bench.
Boys
Okay, let's get him... [more chatter as they place him on the bench and duct-tape him to it]
Butters
Got it. [the boys disperse]
Craig
Have a nice second half of the day, nerdo!
Butters
Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
Mark
Oh, dear.
The Cotswolds house. Mr. and Mrs. Cotswolds pace their living room, worried about their son's whereabouts
Mr. Cotswolds
Oh, where could he be? He should've been home from public school by now.
Mrs. Cotswolds
I'm sure he's alright.
Mr. Cotswolds
[a thump on the door] That must be him. [thump. Mr. Cotswolds opens the door, and both parents look]
Mrs. Cotswolds
Waaaaah! [Mark has walked home still strapped to the bench]
Mr. Cotswolds
Oh my God, son!
Mark
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. [walks in]
Mr. Cotswolds
Mark, what have they done to you?!
Mark
Well, they duct-taped me to a bench.
Mrs. Cotswolds
But why?
Mark
I don't know, mother. It didn't make any sense at all.
Mr. Cotswolds
Well, you see? This is what happens at public schools!
Mark
But I want to go back tomorrow, papá.
Mrs. Cotswolds
What??
Mark
Please, just give me one more day. [walks off]
Mrs. Cotswolds
What do we do?
Mr. Cotswolds
Well, if we're goin' to let him go back, it looks like I need to have a little talk with those other boys' fathers. [snort, snort. He seems to have a little problem with phlegm in the nose]
The Cotswolds house, night. A girl's bedroom is shown. Rebecca is at her desk writing.
A voice
[with guitar]
Everywhere I go, I'm thinking of you, Rebecca.
[she stops writing and looks to the window]
I don't know what to do, Rebecca.[she hops off the chair, walks over to her toy box and hops onto it]
You're so nice, I'd like to get to know you better.[she looks out the window. It is Kyle she sees]
So what do you say we get together?
You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!
You really are quite good-looking, Rebecca!
Rebecca, you're really quite good-looking!
You're a fox.[she looks a bit more, then moves away from the window. Kyle waits, then brightens as she returns. She drops some money down to him, and it lands in the guitar case. She moves away again, and he looks at the money]

The town bar. Jimbo, Ned, Randy, and Gerald sit at the bar sipping some beers. As Mr. Cotswolds enters, the camera pulls back to reveal Stuart McCormick, Richard Tweek, and Craig's father at the bar with the others
Mr. Cotswolds
Good evening, gentlemen. If I can have your attention for a few moments. [the other men turn to face him] My son Mark was beat up in school today by your sons. I think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons, and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy. [sniff]
Randy
Uh, look, Mr....
Mr. Cotswolds
Cotswolds.
Randy
Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.
Mr. Cotswolds
Well, obviously, they need to be coached a little better. [the men get mad. He coughs, then points to Gerald] And furthermore, your son has been harassing my little girl! I would like you to tell him to stop.
Gerald
Hey, my son is just discovering love. Maybe your daughter is, too. They-uh, they need to know about that stuff.
Mr. Cotswolds
Uh, hello-o? My girl is eight years old! What does she need to know about love?
Randy
Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.
Mr. Cotswolds
I will not tell you how to raise your children, and you will not tell me how to raise mine!
Jimbo
Eh, you wanna beer or something, Cotswolds?
Mr. Cotswolds
No, I don't drink beer. I just like wine coolers.
Jimbo
You what??
The town bar, later. The men head out the door.
Jimbo
See ya, Cotswolds. [Randy looks and grins] Thanks for stopping by.
Gerald
Yeah. See ya. [the camera pans down to show Mr. Cotswolds duct-taped to a bench]
South Park Elementary, the cafeteria, next day. Lunchtime. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are at table
Kyle
...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
Mark
[walks up] Can I sit here with you?
Stan
[tsk] Aw, man, if you have to.
Principal Victoria
[over the P.A.] Attention, students. Don't forget that this Friday night is the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. We will have a very special band performing, so please come early.
Kyle
Hey! That's it! That dance! I can ask Rebecca to go to the dance!
Stan
Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. [laughs]
Kenny
(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)
Mark
Why do you call Kyle names and laugh at him? Is he not your friend?
Stan
Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
Mark
I see. It's like, you have to mark your territory as a boy. You have to socially find your place.
Kyle
What??
Craig
[leading a group of boys, walks up] Enjoying your lunch, nerdo?
Mark
[confidently] Ah! Stick and stones may break my bones, but words will never harm me.
Stan
Ah, dude, you don't say that.
Mark
Huh?
Craig
Get him! [the group grabs him and duct-tapes him to an adjacent bench, then walks away.]
Kyle
Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
Stan
Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
The Cartman house, afternoon. Cartman is in bed with a bag of chips.
Cartman
[sighing drowsily] Eeehhh.
Announcer
Welcome to Huntin' and Killin with Jimbo and Ned.
Cartman
Eehh, shut up. [stretches] Ooohhh, yeasss.
Liane
[opens the door] Hon, are you ready for some math problems?
Cartman
Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.
Liane
Oh, all right. [sets them on the nightstand]
Cartman
Mom?
Liane
Yes?
Cartman
Could you turn up the heat just a little?
Liane
Sure, hon. [turns it up and walks out]
Cartman
Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules. [turns to his right side] Yeeehhhhhhss! [goes to sleep.]
The Cotswolds house, afternoon. Kyle approaches the front door and rings the bell. Rebecca answers and immediately puts her hands together
Rebecca
Oh, hel-lo.
Kyle
Hoh! Uh, Rebecca. There's this dance, see, at the school, and um,
Rebecca
He-ey, would you like to come up to my room?
Kyle
Huh?
Rebecca
Woowould you like to come up to my room?
Kyle
Uuuh, okay. [she yanks him in] Gah!
The Cotswolds house, the living room. Mark is talking with his parents
Mr. Cotswolds
I'm sorry, son. There's nothing we can do to stop those bullies. We have to pull you out of public school.
Mark
Oh, papá. Can I at least go to the dance tomorrow?
Mr. Cotswolds
Well alright, you can go, but I'll be there to supervise.
Mark
Alright. [starts to shuffle away]
Mr. Cotswolds
Mark, where's your sister?
Mark
She's upstairs playing Doctor with that Kyle boy.
Mr. Cotswolds
Oh, alright.
Both parents
What?! [they dash to her room]
Mrs. Cotswolds
Rebecca! Aaah! Aaaaah! Noo-hooo!
Mr. Cotswolds
Rebecca, don't play that perverted game! [reaches the door and opens it. Before them is Kyle on his back on a low table covered by a blanket. Rebecca, in scrubs, stands on a chair cutting away at Kyle's hat. Both look at her parents]
Rebecca
I have to extricate a rr-region in his cerebral cortex, or risk ih-nfection to the synaptic responses.
Mr. Cotswolds
Ah. Alright. Rebecca. But it's time to start your home-schooling! [snorts twice and leaves with his wife]
Kyle
Rebecca, there's this dance, see, the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance, and uh, now I was wondering, ih-ih-ih if you wanna go.
Rebecca
[voice quivering] Hhm. Alright, I guess I'll go.
Kyle
You will?
Rebecca
[voice quivering] I guess. Are you gonna go? Maybe I'll see you there.
Kyle
No no. I mean, go with me.
Rebecca
Oh, I'm sure Father will give me a ride. [walks off to her home-schooling. Kyle gets mad and bangs his head against her chair]
The Cartman house, his bedroom. He still looks sleepy.
Cartman
Ahhhhhhhhh. ["Jesus and Pals" is heard in the background] Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.
Liane
[opens the door] Eric, I got you a new history textbook. Why don't you come downstairs.
Cartman
Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. [sighs]
Liane
Eric, please. We have to do some studying today.
Cartman
I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. [she looks over and sees the Fonics Monkey tossing a box of Snacky S'mores around. She withdraws and Cartman yawns again. Stan and Kenny enter]
Stan
Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?
Cartman
[sleepily] Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.
Stan
Well, get your ass out of bed! [Kenny walks off] We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
Cartman
Huh, I can't. I'm too tired. [moves to sleep again] Maybe tomorrow.
Kenny
[to the monkey] (Hey, can I have that?) [reaches for a Snacky S'more in the monkey's hand, but the monkey tosses it away] (Heey.)
Stan
But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
Cartman
[sleepily] That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
Kenny
[smacked against a nightstand by the monkey] (Hey!) [the monkey starts tossing him around like a box] (Hey, Cartman, help me.)
Cartman
No, Fonics Monkey! [the monkey throws Kenny up against the ceiling and stomps on him] No, Fonics Monkey, that's a bad Fonics Monkey! [the monkey smashes Kenny against the foot of Cartman's bed several times, then stomps on him until he no longer responds]
Stan
Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!
Cartman
You're damn straight, he did.
The Cotswolds house, later that afternoon. Kyle is in the backyard waiting for Rebecca. She comes out and closes the sliding door.
Kyle
You got my note?
Rebecca
[voice quivering] Uh of course. You taped it to my dog; how could I not see it?
Kyle
Uh, can we sit down?
Rebecca
Wha-y noh-ot? [leads him onto a nice path next to a lovely flowerbed with all sorts of flora] Isn't Papa's garden beautiful? He works so hard on it. [picks a flower]
Kyle
Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that... [draws close] flicker of light over there?
Rebecca
I... [looks down and away, pulls away a bit] have looked at it.
Kyle
Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children, [draws close] just like us.
Rebecca
How can children go to school on a f-licker of light?
Kyle
From public school, your house is just a flicker of light. [they walk over to a stone bench and sit] Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
Rebecca
Well, what else would one do?
Kyle
Love, for one thing.
Rebecca
And woowhat is love?
Kyle
Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
Rebecca
Woowhat means "ki-iss"?
Kyle
When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
Rebecca
Oh, you mean a-a mate. When it is time to increase the herd, my provider will select one for me.
Kyle
Rebecca, in public school, [hops down] we select our... own mate. [walks off a bit] In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
Rebecca
You certainly come from a silly place. Still, I should like to try that... kiss. [he turns to face her] So I cold write about it. [Kyle walks back and sits on the bench] How do we do it?
Kyle
I'm not completely sure.
Rebecca
Should we... [looks at him] l-look it up?
Kyle
No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. [she hums as they get closer and closer. Their lips touch. A quick kiss and they pull apart]
Rebecca
Wow. Wow, that was fun! [grabs him]
Kyle
Dah. [she kisses him back, then lets go] Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
Rebecca
Y-you bet your sweet a-ass I will.
South Park Elementary, night. The school is lit up for the dance. Seven boys move towards the flagpole: Pip, Stan, Token, Craig, Butters, Fosse, and Bill
Craig
Alright, here's the plan. Tomorrow night at the dance, when none of the chaperones are looking, you guys go grab Mark. Bring him out here, and then we're gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole.
Stan
Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
Craig
That's the point, buttpipe.
Stan
Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!
Butters
Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
Boys
Hooray! [they walk away]
Bill
Hooray. [catches up to the others]
Jimbo
[arrives with a group of men] Alright, here's the plan. All we gotta do is volunteer to chaperone the dance tomorrow. [Randy, Gerald, Ned, and Stuart are also present]
Randy
Uh, why do we want to all chaperone the dance?
Jimbo
Because Cotswolds is gonna to live there. And when he shows up, we all grab him, bring him out here, and duct-tape him to the flagpole!
Gerald
The flagpole! That's great! [Mr. Tweek and Craig's father are now present]
Jimbo
Come on! We gotta buy more duct tape.
Men
[walk away] Alright!
South Park Elementary, night. It's Friday and the kids are gathering in the gym for the dance. Mark is already in the crowd, but the time is not yet. There isn't much to dance to, but kids dance anyway. Wendy and Bebe hop back and forth. Tweek dances as well. Pip is dancing in the background. Annie and Clyde, Token and Red, Kevin, Terrence and Fosse, and the tattered kid stand around.
Stan
[sees Kyle enter and walks to him] Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? [with him are Craig, Butters, and Cartman.]
Kyle
[with a bouquet of flowers] I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
Stan
Oh, brother! [shows his displeasure to the others]
Kyle
Don't you "Oh, brother" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
Stan
You suck now, Kyle! [walks away with the other boys]
Kyle
You suck!
Principal Victoria
[on stage] Boys and girls, can I have your attention, please? This year we have a very special guest performing the South Park Elementary Bay Of Pigs Memorial Dance. He was a musical force in the '70's and '80's. Please welcome Ronnie James Dio! [walks off as the curtains part. Dio appears with his band. The kids look back and say nothing]
Dio
Are you ready to rock, boys and girls?! [silence] I said, are you ready to rock?!
Butters
Uh, uuh, sure uh, I guess.
Dio
Then let's hit it! [the band begins to play] I know you all remember this one. It's off my first solo album. The song that you all helped me make number 1.
Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.
Oh, what's-

Craig
["-becoming of me?"] Hey, there he is! There's the home-schooled kid! [Mark enters and stands next to Kyle] Come on! Let's go duct-tape him to the flagpole! ["Ride the tiger."]
Butters
Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? ["You can see his stripes but you know he's clean."]
Rebecca
[dressed as a slut] Hi, guys. ["Oh, don't you see what I mean?" She walks up to Butters, kisses him, and walks away]
Butters
Woo-oh Holy Cow! [Kyle and Mark are quite surprised. "Gotta get away."]
Rebecca
[walks over to Token] He-ey, baby. Come s-see me later, 'kay? [grabs his ass and walks off]
Token
What the-? Damn, baby. [rubs his ass. Red looks angrily at Rebecca. Kyle is shocked, and Mark has left]
Rebecca
[walks over to Kyle] Hey, Kyle. Wanna go make out?
Kyle
Rebecca. You...
Mark
[returns] Rebecca, what the devil are you doing? [Pip walks by]
Rebecca
I'm... having... fun, Mark. [reels Pip back and kisses him]
Pip
Oh, my goodness! [hurries off]
Mark
You're out of control. [turns to Kyle] You did this to my sister!
Kyle
Uh. All I did was show her how to-
Mark
You made my sister into a slut! I'll kill you! [leaps at him and slaps him around. The kids gather around to watch the fight, and Dio plays on. Mark throws Kyle into the air]
Kyle
[landing on his back] Aaaah!
Mark
[pounces on again] You dip! I'm gonna whip your bitch ass! [slaps him around some more]
Kyle
Ooww!
Craig
Oh my God!
Stan
Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
Butters
Yeah. He's a badass! [smiles]
Randy
[entering] Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. [takes Kyle with him]
Mark
...I'm not through with you, bitch! [Stan walks up]
Stan
Hey, you're pretty cool, Mark. [Butters walks up]
Butters
Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
Stan
Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? [Craig walks up]
Craig
[grabbing Mark's right hand] No! He's my friend!
Butters
[grabbing Mark's left hand] Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! [Mark smiles, pleased that these guys would fight for his friendship]
Mr. Cotswolds
[enters another door with his wife] They've got to be here somewhere.
Jimbo
Hey, there's Cotswolds. Come on! Let's duct-tape him to the flagpole!
Men
Yeah! [move forward. Mr. Cotswolds goes to some outlet and unplugs the sound system. Dio stops playing]
Mr. Cotswolds
Where are my children?! I'm taking them out of this God-forsaken place!
Mark
[onstage, takes the mic from Dio] Calm down, papá! [Papá looks at Mom] Everything is all right. [the kids look at him] You see, I've learned something today. Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it's the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on. [his parents listen] Don't you see, papá? That's what happened to your daughter. You tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual, and now look at her. She's a God-damned whore, papá. [Rebecca is listening]
Butters
Well, she sure is.
Mark
I know letting your kids out into the world is scary. I know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us. But bad things will happen, and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. The men listen]
Mr. Cotswolds
Mark. You're absolutely right. [Mark grins. His mom grins as well] Okay, children. If it's what you want, you can start going to public school.
Kids
Alright! [Rebecca goes up to Kyle and kisses him]
Stan
[goes onstage] Nice speech, nerdo.
Mark
Thanks, gaywad. [Cartman joins them]
Cartman
Now you're gettin' it.
Jimbo
Well, come on, guys. If I'm not mistaken, we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole!
Men
Hooray!
Mr. Cotswolds
What?! [the men hoist him up and carry him out the doors]
Mark
See ya, papá! [Dio takes the mic back]
Dio
Well, I'm glad we all learned something today, kids. Now, let's dance! [resumes with "Holy Diver." The Fonics Monkey is drumming with the band. Mr. Cotswolds is now duct-taped to the flagpole]
Dio
Holy Diver, you've been down too long in the midnight sea.
Oh, what's becoming of me?
[End credits start to roll]
Like the tiger. You can see his stripes but you know he's clean.
Oh, don't you see what I mean?
Gotta get away, Holy Diver.

End of Hooked on Monkey Fonics

Starvin' Marvin in Space
In Memory of Mary Kay Bergman
Space. A small ship makes its way towards Earth. An alien flies the ship. It has a big brain, and its head is covered with veins that stick out.
Marklar
Marklar, this is Marklar. Approaching Marklar.
Marklar dispatcher
Proceed with marklar and make first contact.
Marklar
Marklar. [the Marklar ship descends to Earth and hovers over a desert. It lands, and the Marklar pilot steps out. It walks forward] Greetings, Marklar, I am Marklar. [Two lions and a lioness look at him hungrily.] I come in marklar. [the lions move towards him] Oh, marklar. [the lions jump him and rips him to shreds] AAAAAAAAAA! [the lions run away carrying chunks of the Marklar in their mouths]
Fade to next day, the Ethiopian desert under the hot sun. The Ethiopians laze about in front of their huts, having nothing to do. The camera pans past the hut to a small white church with a simple cross and a white picket fence.
Woman
Hello, everyone. I am Sister Hollis. I was chosen for my mission work to come here to Africa and teach you all about the teachings of Jesus. [a group of Ethiopians sit cross-legged, with their Bibles in front of them on white benches. This is her Bible class. Above them, two ceiling fans spin, clanking a little] Okay then, do we have our Bibles that were handed out freely? [an Ethiopian attempts to eat one, but Hollis interrupts] No no, we don't eat the Bibles, we read them. [returns to the front] Now, let's turn to Mark 3:19. [the class does not respond] Come on, remember [pulls down a chart]: reading Bible plus accepting Jesus equals food. [the students study the chart, then open their Bibles] Good. Now, who can read Mark 3:19? How about... Marvin? [glissant as the camera switches to Marvin reading. He lowers his Bible]
Marvin
Doundobi godia dyum * *
Hollis
No, Marvin, in God's language. English.
Marvin
Dongdin * * mium bidu [closes his Bible, leaves it, and heads towards the door]
Hollis
Where are you going? Back to your life of sin? Don't you understand that unless you find Christ, you and all your people are doomed to eternal hellfire? [Marvin just opens the door, walks out, and heads towards the desert. He passes his people, who can do nothing but moan]
Ethiopians
Ooooohhh. [some of them cough. Marvin shows surprise as he sees a group of eight people on a hill looking down at a column of smoke. He moves up to them]
Marvin
Duo bet tum debettum * * ghm * *? [the camera goes over the group to reveal the Marklar's ship. Marvin stares in awe] Mah tah guum tyum * * ghm tm tm. [moves towards it. The chief says something, but Marvin continues to the ship. He touches it, and it opens up for him, the sand washing off its surface. The group on the hill screams with joy. Some of the group runs away]
Ethiopian
Necah * * necundat? [Marvin opens the cockpit and hops in]
Chief
Nn * * de co?
Marvin
Umi chu. [presses a button to activate a map display. The cockpit closes and the ship lifts off]
Ethiopian Woman
Wobe dabiga gm * *.
Marvin
Gobede *. [presses a button and the ship lurches up. He takes off and comes back, sweeping over the villagers' heads. He takes off into space, into the distance, and then returns. The episode title follows close behind]
Starvin' Marvin in Space
In Star Wars fashion, the camera moves from space down and right to a sunny day in South Park. The camera settles on South Park Elementary as the bell rings. Class is now in session
Mr. Garrison
...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay. [the door opens and two agents enter. They start looking under tables and lifting desks, then lower the blinds...] Uh, can I help you?
Agent 1
Yes. I'm Connelly, and this is Sphinx. We're with the CIA.
Sphinx
We're here to speak with some of your students. [turns to them] You [Cartman], you [Kyle], you [Kenny], and you [Stan].
Mr. Garrison
Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!
Cartman
Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
Kyle
No it wasn't, fatass! I saw you do it!
Connelly
Boys, we need to talk to you about a matter of national security. Now!
Kenny
(Huh?) [Connelly takes Cartman and Kyle, Sphinx takes Kenny and Stan. They then carry the boys out the door. Sphinx reaches back to close it]
Mr. Garrison
I hope you give them the chair! [turns back to the chalkboard] Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. [writes "Hare Krishnas" on the board.]
A military complex. The boys are seated inside a hangar, with a lamp shining on them.
Cartman
Oh, dude, this is not cool!
Kyle
Relax, fatass.
Cartman
No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.
Stan
What??
Cartman
Dude, I've seen it! They grab your balls with their leather-gloved hands and they squeeze 'em as hard as they can until they pop like little grapes!
Stan, Kyle
Ow, dude! [the hangar doors open and the two agents enter]
Cartman
[pointing] Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! [Kenny looks at him]
Sphinx
Relax, boys. We just need to talk with you.
Stan
* I told you, fatass.
Connelly
Approximately 31 hours ago, an ethnic-looking child was spotted flying some kind of state-of-the-art space craft over Chinese air space.
Cartman
Whoa, cool.
Sphinx
Cool? That craft appears to have enough plutonium fuel on board to blow up a large city! Do you think that's cool?!
Cartman
Totally!
Connelly
Alright, children, we just need to know one thing: Do you know this person? [holds up a picture of Marvin]
Cartman
Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.
Stan
Sshh!
Connelly
Who?
Kyle
You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
Cartman
Oh. We don't know him.
Sphinx
We already know you know him. We have this! [a picture of the boys standing behind Marvin outside King Jimmy's Buffet] Now, who is he?! [Kyle farts, and the boys laugh]
Cartman
Kyle's makin' mudpies; you guys want one? [the agents walk away and talk with each other. The boys laugh for a long time...]
Connelly
This is getting us nowhere. We'll have to resort to more drastic measures.
Sphinx
But they're just kids. We can't torture them.
Connelly
Look, we don't know what that craft is capable of, but the kid is going to have to land it somewhere. God only knows what sadistic backwards Third-World country could get their hands on that ship!
Australia. The ship heads towards it, with a song playing in the cockpit. Marvin is enjoying his flight, but the screen tells him to debark
Singer
Soaring so high above the world,
Never thought I could be so free.
I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.

Man 1
[pointing] Oy, look up there! [the ship descends and the engines turn off]
Man 2
It's a UFO! [the windshield rolls back]
Crowd
[start backing up] Oohh?!
Marvin
[appears] Dogom * Dommm * *.
Man 3
Boy, that's one creeepy alien.
Marvin
Gmm * Mmm-mm * *.
Man 4
[prodding] Talk to 'im, Mayor. [the Mayor walks up to Marvin and speaks]
Mayor
Great and noble alien creature. As Mayor of the fine planet of Australia, I welcome you to our fine... planet of Australia. Chippy chip
Crowd
Churrah! [Marvin pulls out pencil and paper and starts drawing...]
Mayor
Look out, he's got a gun! [shields his face. The others cower]
Man 5
Wait, it's not a gun. It's a piece of paper.
Mayor
Oh. [the paper has a drawing of Australia and of Marvin's people. Marvin draws an arrow from his people to Australia] Oh, I think he's tryin' to tell us that he wants to relocate all his species here to Australia.
Marvin
* * Muogleblabla mb'g * *.
Mayor
Well, you certainly are all welcome 'ere, alien. In fact, there's a mission right over there that will take all your people in. [it looks just like the one he left in Ethiopia. A woman is at the door.]
Woman
Hello-o. [Marvin looks, and the smile leaves his face. He hops back into the craft and takes off]
Mayor
Guess the little pecker doesn't like missionaries.
The military complex. The children are being tortured, but not physically. They moan and grunt
Sphinx
Now, I'll ask you again. Who is the little boy that took our ship?
Stan
We don't know. [some scratching is heard]
The Boys
Aaaaaaaa! [Sphinx is scratching at a balloon] Aaaaaaaa!
Connelly
[holds up a picture of Marvin in the spacecraft] Who is this person!
Cartman
[gasping] K-kill me.
Connelly
Do it again. [Sphinx scratches the balloon...]
The Boys
Aaaaaaaa!
Cartman
No wait. I'll tell you. [the agents take off their ear muffs] He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
Kyle
Cartman!
Sphinx
Adopted from whom?
Cartman
Sally. Sally Struthers. The lady on TV. She knows everything. Sally Struthers.
Connelly
Sally Struthers!
Sphinx
Where can we find her?!
Connelly
I know exactly where Sall Struthers is. Let them go.
Kyle
Good job, fatass!
Cartman
Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.
Stan
[moving past Kyle and Cartman] Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.
Ethiopia, the FEED THE CHILDREN FOUNDATION building. The agents sit in the lobby reading newspapers
Receptionist
Gentlemen, Ms. Struthers can see you now. [the men rise and go for the door, but before they enter Connelly stops and closes the door]
Connelly
I'm warning you, Bill. Sally Struthers is a bit heavy. But don't say anything, because she's pretty sensitive.
Sphinx
Oh, I would never say anything. I saw some show where they made fun of Sally Struthers' weight, and I thought it was totally cruel. I mean, she helps people, you know. [they enter. The storage room has been transformed into awfully dark living quarters for her]
Connelly
Ah, Ms. Struthers.
Sally
Oh ho ho ho. [she now has the shape of a Hutt] Un chaka solo david. Saime no Chewbacca dakaiminbi? ho ho. ["Hello gentlemen. How can I help you?"]
Connelly
Ms. Struthers. We understand you have helped raise millions of dollars to help starving children in Ethiopia.
Sally
Oh? Makarendae bi cho. ["I do my best."] Ho ho ho.
Connelly
We need information on one of the Ethiopians. You must tell us everything you know about him. [waves his hand in a Jedi fashion]
Sally
Do ba kim.
Sphinx
Uh, heh-his name is Starving Marvin.
Sally
[begins to sniff around] Jonoba unko chocolate Yum Yum bar ancho? ["Is that a chocolate Yum Yum bar in your pocket?"]
Connelly
Why, yes. It is a chocolate Yum Yum bar, Ms. Struthers [removes it from his coat pocker and waves it around], and there are several more where that came from. [Sally licks her lips. Connelly sees a trash can nearby and opens it, then dangles the bar over it] Of course, if you don't want to tell us about the Ethiopian boy...
Sally
Mmmmo na ka!
Connelly
[closes the trashcan and walks over with the candy bar] I'm... glad we can do business.
Cartman's house, night. The boys are on the sofa watching TV. Cartman has the remote
Stan
Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
Cartman
Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? [a shot of Pat Robertson asking for pledges on the CBC channel.]
Pat
Uh, God wants you to send us money. He needs you to send us money so we can help others.
Cartman
Oh, my God, this guy again. ["What we do is- "]
Kyle
Why would anybody send this asshole money? ["-we go all around the world and-"]
Kenny
(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) [The boys laugh. "-we give Bibles and and, and..."]
Kyle
Yeh-hah. [They hear noise outside, and soon Marvin's ship crashes through the front wall of the house.]
Boys
Whoa! [They rush outside to see the rest of the ship. Cartman goes to see the damage]
Cartman
Oh! Aww! [Part of the second story of the house falls away.] Oh, weak! [Marvin hops down from the ship]
Kyle
Starvin' Marvin!
Marvin
Bongi groinit * *.
Kyle
He did take a ship.
Cartman
Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!
Marvin
Ingan *.
Stan
Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
Marvin
Chede gwodum * * godom.
Kyle
I think he wants us to get in.
Stan
Kick ass! [Marvin returns to the pilot's seat; the others hop in and stand around him.] Wow, this thing is awesome!
Kyle
Let's go somewhere. [Marvin pulls the ship out of Cartman's house and flies low over the ground]
Singer
Soaring so high above the world,
Never thought I could be so free.

Stan
[the ship goes higher, over other cities] Wow!
Kyle
Yes!
Singer
I'm one with the birds, and magic is all I see.

Stan
This is great!
Cartman
Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? ["And it's a wonderful day 'cause something-"]
Marvin
[turns off the music] Gmmm?
Stan
Yeah, that's better.
Ethiopia, day. A man tries to rise, but doesn't have the energy to do it
Man
Oooh. [falls back on his pillow. Sister Hollis comes up]
Hollis
Hello? Howare we doing today? Look what I got for you.
Man
[quickly rising] Nn * wohg *?
Hollis
No, it's not food. It's a cross. [hands it to him] And it has your Christian name printed on it. From now on, you are Michael. Can you say "Michael"? [the man clicks and holds up the cross] Mmmi-chael. [the man clicks again] Oh, well. You'll get it. [walks away and heads over to a family of four] Hello, brother David. Do you have any sins to confess? [David does not respond, but a fly lands on his eye] Anybody? Sins to confess? Joshua? [he just looks up at her] You know, today I'm reminded of Psalm 46, line 39: "Though the mountains shake and th-" [the CIA agents walk up]
Connelly
Here they are!
Hollis
Who are you?
Connelly
We're with the American government! Sally Struthers told us where we'd find Marvin's parents!
Sphinx
Hello there, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk. I think you know why we're here. [the family stares in horror]
The Marklar ship, night. The boys are flying over a desert
Kyle
No, dude, you don't wanna bring your people to Mexico, there's missionaries there, too.
Marvin
Blubedegub? [points to Utah on the map]
Cartman
No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.
Stan
Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. [the world map is shown]
Cartman
Well, he hasn't been here yet. Where's this? [presses a big red button on the left side of the display panel. The ship bucks and heads into space.]
Boys
Whooaaa! [the ship rolls sideways for a moment]
Stan
What the hell did you hit, Cartman?! [a wormhole appears before them, and they head for it]
Kyle
Oh, my God! What the hell is that thing?! [the ship races into the wormhole]
Boys
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [everything inside the ship begins to twist and warp] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [more twisting and warping, and the ship races out of the wormhole into a star system with a green planet. Everything inside the ship is normal again]
Kyle
[gasps] Where are we?
Marvin
Gobin gobedo * * gowog. [the ship heads down into the atmosphere and then towards an island]
Stan
We're on like, some foreign planet.
Kyle
This place is rad. Look at all the trees and stuff.
Marvin
Gewhit * * Gewit um hebed wabaduh. Gabalah. [the ship descends to a plain next to a waterfall, and lands]
Planet Marklar, day. The ship's windshield rolls back. The boys climb down and look around
Marvin
Badak bladla buk.
Marklar Leader
Greetings. Welcome to Marklar.
Stan
Uh, thanks.
Marklar Leader
I am Marklar, leader of the Marklar.
Stan
U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
Marklar Leader
[bows] Marklar to you.
Stan
Cool!
Cartman
Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
Sta
Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!
Cartman
Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! [the Marklar leader looks a bit confused. Marvin steps forward and smiles. The land around the group is green and lush, water is plentiful...]
Marklar Leader
We are very thankful to you for bringing our marklar back to us.
Kyle
[joins Marvin] Wait. I thought you called your planet Marklar.
Marklar Leader
Oh, here on Marklar, we refer to all people, places, and things as marklar.
Kyle
Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
Stan
[Cartman looks in pleasant wonder] Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
Marklar Leader
Well, there is a lot of room on Marklar. If Marklar here wants to bring his marklar to Marklar, that would be fine. Just take our marklar back to Marklar and bring all the marklar back with you.
Stan
Uuh. Thanks.
Marvin
* *.
Ethiopia, day. The agents are still drilling Marvin's family
Connelly
Let's go through this one more time, Mr. and Mrs. Clickclickderk! Your son Marvin has the ship that we want! How can we get it from him? [the family sits still]
Sphinx
[switching places with Connelly] We are the CIA. That ship needs to be with us! Maybe we should just take something precious of yours, huh?! [lifts his shades and scans the area] Daha! [picks up a gourd and dangles it] This! This gourd-thingy, for instance. How do you like that, huh? If you ever wanna see this... little... thingy again, I suggest you contact your boy! [the family just looks at him. At that moment, the Marklar ship zooms over the little village, and the villagers raise a ruckus over Marvin's return. The ship stops and descends, engines roaring]
Sphinx
There it is! [Hollis covers her ears. The ship lands and everyone moves towards it. The windshield rolls back and the boys scramble down from the ship]
Marvin
Muwuhbuh * * mlamleblubluh mjek.
Connelly
Back away from the space craft, children!
Stan
Nno. No, it's okay. The ship took us to another planet. A beautiful, lush place called Marklar.
Kyle
Yeah. And the leader, he said that all the Ethiopians can go live there. [the Ethiopians all begin to speak]
Hollis
Alien race? Have they... heard the word of Christ?
Cartman
No, never. It's perfect.
Hollis
Ooh, no. Those poor souls. We must spread the Gospel to them. [hurries away]
Stan
What??
Marvin
*. [walks to Hollis] Mluglu dja mugm blugabeb * * *.
Kyle
Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
Connelly
You'll do nothing of the kind! This ship is now property of the United States Government!
Kyle
No! [agents rush in from all sides and some black helicopters appear over the space ship. Two FBI agents come and stand behind the boys.]
Marvin
[tugs at Hollis' dress] Dor dor binor hm ghm.
Sphinx
Call those boys' mothers. [Connelly starts dialing] I'm sure they'll be very interested in the trouble their boys have been up to.
Kyle
Oh, no, dude!
CBC television studios. The CBC logo, a pair of angel wings topped by a halo, and CBC printed in front of them, fills the screen. Next comes "Christian Broadcasting Channel"
Pat
["TO PLEDGE CALL: 1-800-555-2717"] You know, Susan, the uh-there are so many great missionaries doing work, out there in in in-in parts of Africa, and uh we're trying to get Bibles to people all over the world. And what we need, is the help of everyone out there so that we can continue these, these projects. Now, listen to this, Susan. [a picture of Hollis with two Ethiopians appears over his right shoulder] Wha-one of our missionaries in North Africa has made an amazing discovery. U-u-uh a new planet, in the in the galaxy Alpha Seti VI, that has intelligent life on it.
Susan
Amazing.
Pat
Yeah. We're not sure what these hyper-intelligent beings look like, but one thing is for sure: they've never heard of Jesus Christ.
Susan
What can we do at the 600 Club to help those poor aliens?
Pat
Well, what we need, Susan, is we need money to build an interstellar cruiser. [a diagram of said cruiser appears over his shoulder: the XT-9000] Now, this space ship will be able to travel through a wormhole and deliver the message and guh-glory of Jesus Christ to those godless aliens. S-send your money now. Amen.
Ethiopia. The agents are still investigating...
Connelly
I want everyone to keep a safe distance from the craft until we can run some tests.
FBI Agent
[walks up] E-excuse me, gentlemen, uh Tom Brokaw is here to see you.
Sphinx
Tom Brokaw? Oh no, the press already? [the CIA agents walk over]
"Brokaw"
[sounds like Cartman] Oh. Good day, gentlemen. [the yellow headband and the shape of the pant legs look familiar...]
Sphinx
Uh huh. [FBI agents gather behind him and Connelly] Mr. Brokaw, I presume.
"Brokaw"
You presume wisely, sir. I'm here to get the big story, the big scoop. [Marvin tip-toes to the ship unnoticed] I understand that you've found some kind of ship from an alien race. [Marvin opens the cargo door and signals for his people to enter the ship. They start doing so] Seeing as though I am Pulitzer-prize-winning Tom Brokaw...
Connelly
Look, kid. Did you really think this was going to fool anybody? You don't look anything like Tom Brokaw.
"Brokaw"
What?! Do you question my integritah?!
Kyle
[from the pants] I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
"Brokaw"
Buh-eh, ugh. I had some bad burritos today.
Marvin
* * wughum chughum * *, * *.
Connelly
[he and Sphinx remove the men's clothes from the boys] Alright boys. Time to get back to your quarters.
Stan
Oh. [the cargo door closes and Marvin is ready to take off]
Connelly
Son of a bitch!
Stan
Run for it!
Connelly
Get 'em! [two FBI agents move]
Cartman
Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
Kyle
Watch out! Here I come!
Kenny
(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-) [trips over a rock and lands on his face] (Oof.)
Kyle
Kenny!
Cartman
Forget him! He's done for! [Stan climbs up and looks back]
Stan
He's not done for, he's standing right there.
Kenny
(You guys, just fly away!)
Cartman
No, no, he's done for. Come on! [the windshield rolls down and the ship takes off. It zooms into the distance, then straight up into space. The helicopters could not catch up]
Sphinx
[holding Kenny] Nooo!
Connelly
Damnit, damnit, damnit!
The Marklar ship, space. The ship speeds away from Earth.
Stan
Alright, we made it!
Kyle
Okay, Marvin. Time to take your people to their new home!
Marvin
Gakchak ghm. [a blast is felt inside. Its impact site is near the cockpit]
Kyle
What was that? [the CBC's XT-9000 appears behind them. Inside, Sister Hollis is manning the bridge, with another woman and four men.]
Hollis
This is the Missionary 600. We have you locked on "fire: ready." Turn back right now. [another shot is fired, and the Marklar ship is hit again.]
Boys
Aaaa!
Ethiopians
[tossed to one side of the cargo bay] Whoa!
Stan
They're shooting at us.
Kyle
Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.
Marvin
[tries all the buttons, including the red one, but to no avail] Midik, gmanjaum * *.
Kyle
Well, how'd we do it last time??
Stan
Cartman just hit the button, and the ship flew itself.
Kyle
Which button did you press, Cartman??
Cartman
U-u-huh. I don't remember.
Kyle
You don't remember?!
Stan
You dumbass, Cartman!
Cartman
Hey, I was under duress! Maybe it waaas this one. [presses the big red button]
Singer
Soaring so high above the world.

The Boys
Aawwww!
Singer
Never-

The Missionary 600, still pursuing the Marklar ship
Hollis
The ship seems to be made out of a... super-strong alloy. These lasers aren't powerful enough.
The 600 Club, Pat Robertson reporting
Pat
Everyone, the Word of God is going around the world and all your help is so greatly appreciated. Eh-oo What we need now is an argon crystal laser. [the 900txl] Eh you see, an argon crystal laser can pierce thick space holes in a way that other lasers just can't. Send your money now. Uuh-I th-thank you.
Ethiopia, day. Feed The Children Foundation. The agents are talking to Sally Struthers
Sally
[eating her way through a box of food relief] Onadonakami?
Connelly
Ms. Struthers, we understand that you have a ship of your own. One capable of interstellar travel.
Sally
Chewmbacca vije dai gwo. ["Maybe I do, and maybe I don't."]
Sphinx
We need to use your ship to catch those boys. We will do anything for that technology.
Sally
Juodo nakahobi? Ho ho ho ho. ["Why should I help you?"]
Sphinx
Ms. Struthers, if those Ethiopians make it to another planet, who will send money to your foundation? Without Ethiopians, you have no food.
Sally
Wo? Wo chaka gom??
Connelly
Oh, that won't be a problem, Ms. Struthers. We have... collateral. [steps aside and brings Kenny in]
Kenny
(Oh my God, I get it.)
Sally
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho. [a small creature pops out and laughs]
The Missionary 600, still pursuing the Marklar ship
Hollis
I have the infidels in my sight. [the Marklar ship tries evasive maneuvers, but it is hit again.]
Cartman
Holy shit!
Ethiopians
[tossed to the other side of the cargo bay] Whoa!
Marvin
Doye dondabuh. [swings the ship around and fires two blasts at the Missionary 600]
Crew
Aaah.
Hollis
Holy crap, they have photon torpedoes.
The 600 Club, Pat Robertson reporting
Pat
Uhnow, our deflector shields are useless against phorton torpedoes, and we really need your support on this one, folks. Here at the 600 Club we need your money to spread the Word of Jesus, and build more advanced deflector shields for our galactic cruiser. Call now, and we'll give you this free pin. [a CBC logo pin]
Space. The Missionary 600 and the Marklar ship now do battle. Marvin fires at the Missionaary 600 twice more.
600 Crew
Aaah.
Stan
You got 'em, Marvin.
Kyle
Yeah, now finish 'em off! [a huge junker comes up behind and fires at them]
Computer
[female voice] Warning. Deflector shields failing.
Kyle
Where did that come from??
Sally
Ho ho ho ho. [the CIA agents stand behind her, and two other men are at the helm]
Connelly
Good! Now get them in our tractor beam! [the beam is activated and holds the Marklar ship in place. The Missionary 600 comes around and faces the Marklar ship]
Hollis
Now we've got 'em! [in the Marklar ship, the boys look at the screen...]
Sally
Ho ho ho ho.
Cartman
It's Sally Struthers!
Hollis
Well, it appears they'll be going back to Ethiopia, so we can go on to the aliens.
Kyle
Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
Cartman
Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
Sally
Wo?
Cartman
Ms. Struthers, please. Just listen to me for one second. You started the Feed the Children Foundation for wonderful reasons: to help starving, helpless people who live in a rotten part of the world. Well, it's for those reasons we wanna help our friend Marvin now. [Sally looks moved]
Sally
Holna chewbacca? ["Because of me?"]
Sphinx
Ms. Struthers, don't forget the gift we gave you: the child in carbonite. [points. The camera pans over to a panel which shows Kenny encased in carbonite]
Sally
Dama doko nou na oh. ["Let him speak."]
Cartman
Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. [Sally considers Cartman's statements for a moment, then...]
Sally
Oh, foada! ["You're right!" She presses a button, and the tractor beam switches off the Marklar ship and on the Missionary 600]
600 Crew
[the bridge jerks a bit] Whoa! [the beam pulls the Missionary 600 closer to the junker.]
Cartman
She bought it.
Stan
Sally Struthers is saving us!
The 600 Club, Pat Robertson reporting
Pat
Uh, now, now, stay with me on this one, folks. Uh, Sally Struthers has a Tiberian junker [pictured in a window], which is uh the favorite ship of the Hutts, and she has trapped oureh, our our new CBC ship in an uh [struggling] poe-sitronic tractor beam. [a stage hand holds up this cue card that reads: Tractor Beam, so we're gonna need a Ionic Tractor Disruptor] Uh, so we're gonna need an ionic tractor disruptor. Now now, not a regular ionic di- tractor disruptor, but a negative ionic tractor disruptor to uh, help spread the Word of Jesus. [to Susan, softly] I don't have a fucking idea up here.
Space. The junker is busy pulling the Missionary 600 in. The Marklar ship is free to leave
Stan
Now's our chance!
Cartman
Wait. I remember. It was the red button! [presses it, and the ship zooms away. The wormhole appears again and the ship head for it]
Hollis
They've opened the wormhole!
Kyle
It's pulling us in! [the junker and the Missionary 600 give chase. All three ships enter the wormhole, and all experience its warping effects.]
Boys
Aaaah!
600 Crew
Aaaah! [the ships rush out of the wormhole and into Alpha Seti VI, near the Marklar planet]
Marklar. The ship land. The Missionary 600 has to lean to one side. All parties are out of their ships
Kyle
Marvin... [everyone talks at once]
Marklar
Please, please, please. We are confused. You must explain one at a Marklar.
Hollis
Alien friend, we are here to spread the Word of Jesus. He died for your sins.
Marklar
Who? Marklar?
Stan
We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
Marklar
Brought m- marklar??
Hollis
What is "marklar"?
Marklar
Yyou're marklar; everyone and everything is referred to as marklar.
Sphinx
Doesn't that get confusing?
Marklar
Oh no. Watch this. Hey, Marklar!
Marklar
[in orange robe] Yes?
Marklar
You see?
Kyle
[steps forward] Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
Marklar
Young marklar, your marklars are wise and true.
Hollis
What the hell did he say?
Stan
[hushed] Wow! Good job, dude!
Kyle
Thanks.
Marklar
The marklars can stay!
Ethiopians
Wooo!
Boys
Alright!
Cartman
Alright,
Marklar
You marklars must leave.
Hollis
But you will all burn forever in eternal hellfire. [she and the other woman are taken away]
Marklar
Yes, that's nice. Thank you for stopping by.
Stan
Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
Marvin
Chak chak glika gm gm guchab mglup.
Kyle
No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
Sally
Bwo chaaga bi.
Boys
[leaving] Goodbye, Marvin.
Marvin
Chak chak m geteaub m * *.
Stan
Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
Cartman
Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
Stan
Dude!
Cartman
What? We're not gonna come visit him.
Stan
I know, but you don't tell him that!
Cartman
T'heh, whatever. [the Ethiopians chatter over their new home and head for the lake at the foot of the waterfall]

End of Starvin' Marvin in Space

The Red Badge of Gayness
The bus stop, morning. The boys are dressed in Union blue. Stan bears the flag, Kyle and Kenny have fifes, and Cartman carries a drum.
Stan
Ready? 1-2-3-4. [the boys begin to march forward and play.]
Cartman
Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?! [answers himself] Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
Kyle
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Cartman
I'm playing the drum.
Kyle
Well, you have to hit it softer!
Cartman
You can't just "hit" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it! [to the drum, hitting it once in a while] Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!! [to Kyle] That's how you rock, dude.
Kyle
You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
Cartman
I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
Stan
That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
Cartman
Ey, I'll get it!
Kyle
Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
Cartman
Yes I will!
Stan
Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. [again, the march and play. Cartman gets carried away and the others glare at him]
Cartman
Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, dammit!
Kyle
Cartman!!! [Cartman stops]
Cartman
What?
Kyle
Give me the drum, and you play the flute.
Cartman
No way! Flutes are totally gay!
Kenny
[inspects his flute] (Oh. Flutes are gay?)
Stan
Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
Cartman
Oh! Well, you know what I say?! [drops his drum and jumps on it] Screw you guys, I'm going home! [walks away, leaving the drum split in two]
Kyle
You dick!
Cartman
Later.
The South Park Banquet Hall, 8:04 A.M., morning of reenactment. "Welcome Reenacters." People inside chatter away
Jimbo
Alrighty everyone. We just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield. [the townsmen are dressed in the Blue and the Grey] First of all, I have great news. There are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this year's reenactment, and that's the best turnout ever!
Men
[jump and cheer] Yes! Woohoo, yea!
Stan
Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. [Kyle and Kenny are also present]
Kyle
He'll show.
Stan
He'd better!
Jimbo
I'm also very proud to announce that this year's alcohol sponsor, Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps, the schnapps with the delightful taste of s'mores.
Men
Whoa. Mmm.
Mr. Garrison
Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.
Stuart
[coughs] Hih yeah, and it's got quite a kick, too.
Jimbo
And now, to clarify how the reenactment should unfold, let's bring up our master historian, Grandpa Marvin Marsh, [Grandpa rolls up in his wheelchair amid applause] the only man old enough to have actually seen the Civil War... reenactment of 1924.
Kyle
Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?
Stan
Dude, that's not cool.
Cartman
[arrives dressed in the Grey] Good morning, gentlemen.
Stan
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Kyle
Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
Cartman
Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
Stan
You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
Cartman
Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
Grandpa
Okay, you all know the rules. You must fire your blanks into the air, and if someone says they killed ya, you gotta play dead.
Kyle
The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
Cartman
Nuh uhn, the South is gonna win.
Kyle
No they're not, stupid!
Cartman
Yes we are!
Kyle
How much do you wanna bet?!
Jimbo
Now remember, everybody: for a good reenactment we've got to pretend down to the last detail that we're really in the Civil War. So when the North wins, all of us on the Confederate side should act all bummed and depressed. [continues as the boys speak]
Kyle
Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
Cartman
Well, this war is about slavery, so how about if the South wins, you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month.
Kyle
And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
Cartman
Right.
Kyle
You're on!
Cartman
Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. [walks away]
Stan
Hoohoo what a dumbass!
Kyle
Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
Stan
It's gonna be rad having Cartman be our slave.
Jimbo
...And with that, let's all go to Tamarack Hill and put on a good show!
Men
[jump and cheer] Yes! Woohoo, yea!
"Tamarack Hill," 9:00 A.M. The Reenactment. Bleachers flank Grandpa on either side as the North and the South face off before him. Each side has set up its camp
Announcer
Welcome to the South Park reenactment of the Battle of Tamarack Hill. The men in gray are the Confederacy, from the South [Butters is there]; in blue are the Union, from the North [Chef is there, and Kenny has the drum].
Grandpa
[addressing the spectators] It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to get the bell of Appomattox down from Tamarack Hill. What ensued was a bloody battle, but after many hours, the Union Army prevailed. Here now is the reenactment of that great battle. [blows the whistle]
Jimbo
[leading the South] Forward! [The South advances]
Randy
[leading the North] Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! [the North advances, the boys play their tune]
Jimbo
Fire! [some guns go off]
Confederate Reenactors
Yeah!
Randy
Alright men, fire! [some guns go off]
Union Reenactors
Yeah! [the battle is joined, and men left and right begin to drop away. Others scream]
Randy
Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.
Ned
[Jimbo fires a few shots] Ow.
Randy
Yeh-hah! [the battle continues, and even a cow gets into the act]
Man 1
[in the stands] Oh, so this is what it was like. [the battle continues, but now it's hand-to-hand combat. Cartman reaches the bell and starts to push it down the hill]
Man 2
Hey! What's that guy doing?!
Cartman
Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
Reenactors
[on both sides] Huh? Wha-?
Grandpa
What the hell?
Randy
He took the bell!
Gerald
He can't do that!
Grandpa
The Confederacy doesn't take the bell!
Cartman
[skating by on the bell] Hooray for the South!
Stan
Cartman, you can't do that!
Grandpa
God dammit! Now we have to start over!
10:24 A.M., reenactment - second attempt.
Jimbo
Alrighty everyone. [Cartman walks up] We're going to do the entire reenactment again, because of some confusion over the bell. Now, I know you're just trying to help Eric, but we have to let the Union capture the bell this time.
Cartman
But why? Why should they get the bell?
Jimbo
Wuh. Well, 'cause we're supposed to lose.
Cartman
But we don't have to lose.
Jimbo
What??
Cartman
[assuming command] Gentlemen, we can win this battle! [paces] Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, "We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, "Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!" [some of the men drink schnapps]
Jimbo
[takes a swig] By God, he's right!
Mr. Garrison
Jimbo!
Jimbo
Yeah, I've been reenacting this war for 22 years now. And for 22 years us Confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the Union reenactors! Well, I'm sick of it!
Mr. Garrison
Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
Stuart
I'm tired of losing this battle!
Jimbo
And I say it's high time we kicked some ass! Who's with me?!
Reenactors
Yeah!
Reenactor
Yeah! [drops down drunk. Cartman grins]
The battlefield
Grandpa
Alright, folks. Sorry for the false start. We're ready to go again. It was a cold morning in 1862. The Union Army had to- [turns at the sound of a gun shot and looks as the Confederates charge down the field]
Confederate 1
Yaaaaah!
Confederate 2
Come on! Just give up! We're not gonna let you live another day!
Gerald
Uh, what are they doing?
Mr. Garrison
[drunk] You Yankee sons of bitches!
Randy
[a Confederate shoots him on the belly] Ow! That hurt!
Grandpa
God dammit, what the hell are they doing?!
Kyle
What do we do?!
Stan
Run for your life, dude! [the boys run off. Cartman watches from the hill as the battle rages on]
Cartman
God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
Reenactor
Come on!
Randy
[tackled by Jimbo] Oh?
Jimbo
[pins Randy to the ground] Surrender your men, general!
Randy
Jimbo, have you lost your mind?!
Jimbo
[yells] SURRENDER YOUR MEN, GENERAL!
Randy
Alright, alright. We surrender. [the Union soldiers drop their guns and raise their arms. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk out from behind a tree with their hands up.]
Barbrady
[in the stands] The South win?
Jimbo
The South wins!
Reenactors
Yeah, woohoo!
Grandpa
God dammit!
South Park Banquet Hall, 3:45 p.m. Reenactment after party. The men are all in conversation
Jimbo
[walks up to Randy] Well, we can all be friends now. [nudges him] Come on, Randy. Have some s'more schnapps. [hands Randy a bottle]
Randy
Uh, I can't be happy. You ruined the reenactment.
Jimbo
Aw, come on. Have a little sip. [Randy sips]
Cartman
[walks up to Stan and Kyle] So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
Kyle
You cheated, Cartman!
Stan
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
Kyle
Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
Cartman
[sighs] I hate you guys so much. So very very much. And this is not over. Not by a long shot. [the men are getting more drunk]
Randy
[talking to Stuart with slurred speech] All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
Mr. Garrison
That ain't true! The Confederates would have whupped ass in Topeka, too!
Bartender
Yeah.
Reenactor
Yeah.
Gerald
You're dreaming!
Cartman
[walks up to Jimbo] Perhaps we should take Topeka.
Jimbo
Huh?
Cartman
They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
Jimbo
They don't?!
Cartman
No. I say we take Topeka.
Jimbo
[to the crowd] You know what? I'll bet we could take Topeka right now and clear them all around!
Randy
Huh?
Stuart
That's right! Maybe we should do what the Confederates would've done and march on to Topeka!
Mr. Garrison
I'll bet we could!
Jimbo
I'll bet we could, too! [pounds on the podium]
Cartman
[throwing his voice] I'll bet you can't.
Jimbo
[jumps back] What?! [then walks and stands in front of the podium] Is that a challenge?! I'll bet we can!
Cartman
[fake voice] I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
Jimbo
Pussies?! Oh yeah?! Men! It's time to show the world what the Confederate Army has got! We're gonna take Topeka once and for all!
Reenactor 1
Yeah.
Reenactor 2
Yeah.
Jimbo
[walks to the Union soldiers] All o' you men. You may have lost in the Union today, but join us now and win back your pride!
Reenactor 3
Yeah.
Reenactor 4
Yeah.
Randy
Well, the Union be damned!
Jimbo
Let's go!
Men
Yeah! [all walk out]
Cartman
[trailing, stops by his friends] Oh! What was our bet again? Let's see... Yes, I remember. If the South wins you have to be my slaves for a month.
Kyle
They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
Cartman
Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
Kenny
(Woohoo!) [exits with Cartman. The men charge out of the banquet hall growling]
Topeka, Kansas, 7:53 A.M., next morning. A rooster crows. The town goes about its business. A mailman delivers some mail. A woman opens the school door. A traffic cop directs traffic. Two kids play catch in front of the school. The woman returns with the flag and hoists it up on the flagpole, and the mailman drops by.
Mailman
Oh good morning, Mrs. Hollis.
Mrs. Hollis
Hello, Ralph.
Ralph
Did you happen to catch that ball game last night?
Mrs. Hollis
I'm afraid I was grading papers pretty late and- [both turn in the direction of a rumble. Everyone stops and looks in the same direction]
Driver
What's that noise, officer? [the officer looks, and the South Park men rise over a hill and charge towards town.]
South Park Men
Yeah! Yeah!
Jimbo
Ccchhhhaaaarrrrggggeeee!
Randy knocks Ralph down with the butt of his gun. Gerald tackles Mrs. Hollis. Another man prepares a Molotov cocktail and throws in into a house, then salutes the resulting fire. Jimbo and Med head for the church, and its congregants rush out screaming. Stuart aims at the officer and shoots him
Officer
[soothing his ass] Ow!
Stuart
Freeze, buddy. These are blanks, but they still hurt like hell! [the church bell rings. Jimbo is pulling at the rope]
Jimbo
It's ours, it's ours! We've taken Topeka!
Reenactors
Yeah!
Randy
[still holding Ralph] Alright, Yank, tell us where you keep your Jagermin's S'more-flavored Schnapps?!
Ralph
Uh-uh-uh schnapps? Uhm, uh-uh-I guess that would be at the liquor store.
Randy
WHERE?!
Ralph
[desperately] At the liquor store, at the liquor stohohohohore!
Randy
[drops Ralph] Come on, boys! [they all rush the store]
Mrs. Hollis
[looking on] This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
Cartman
[walks by] Excuse meh.
South Park. Stan and Kyle wait at a regular bus stop
Stan
Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
Kyle
I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
Stan
Oh here comes the bus. [a tourist bus. Butters is behind the doors waiting to come out. The doors open and Butters exits. The bus leaves] Butters? Are you the only one that came back?
Butters
Uh, conuh- [salutes] Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. [offers it]
Stan
What battlefield?!
Butters
Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see? [hands the message to Stan] Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? [Stan opens and reads the message. A Ken Burns effect sequence starts using a 19th century sepia image of Cartman as General Lee]
Cartman
Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
Stan
[crumples the message into a ball and throws it away] God dammit, that fat piece of shit!
Kyle
Dude! What if Cartman really does succeed? And we really do have to be his slaves??
Stan
That would suck so much ass.
Kyle
We have to stop him, dude.
Stan
I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
Butters
Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
Kyle
We'll give you 10 bucks.
Butters
Oh. O-oh, okay.
News Report
Reporter
...And she was forced to live off her own feces for several days. In national news, [the group's entry into Topeka is shown] a frightening radical group from Colorado is making its way across the Southern states of America. [the guy throwing the Molotov cocktail is shown] The group is recruiting new members in every town they pass through, and rapidly growing in number. [one last attack is shown] So authorities have decided to call in the National Guard. The groups seems to be led by military mastermind and right-wing radical Jimbo Kern [he is shown armed], who is known for his guerrilla-fighting and leadership skills.
Somewhere...
Jimbo
[now bloated and sluggish] Give me some more s'more schnapps! I'm gonna be sick. [vomits] Blouach.
Chattanooga, Tennessee, 2:35 P.M. The town is destroyed and in flames. The men revel in their victory. Stan and Kyle approach the city with Grandpa and look over it from a hill
Stan
Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
Grandpa
Well, come on Billy, we've gotta make these little peckers stop before they get themselves killed.
Man
[running] Aaaaa!
Brunet
They say you can either fight them or join them.
Blond
Well I'm joining them. Those blanks hurt!
Stan
[now in town] Dad, Dad. [Randy appears and stops] Mom wants you to come home.
Randy
Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging. [a resident runs by] Get over here!
Kyle
You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
Gerald
This is a reenactment, Kyle. My name is Pvt. John Fugasol, and I have to do what my general tells me!
Jimbo
Hey! There's some more schnapps over here!
Gerald
More schnapps! [moves towards it]
Sgt. Larsen
[the National Guard arrives] I'm Sgt. Larsen of the National Guard. We're here to stop the terrorists.
Grandpa
They're not terrorists, they're just a bunch of drunk wankers from Colorado.
Larsen
Well, we can't just shoot 'em; there's innocents and children about. Dawkins!
Dawkins
Sir!
Larsen
Fire a warning flare!
Dawkins
Yes sir! [launches the flare. The flare goes up in the air, lands right on Kenny and burns him to a crisp.]
Jimbo
Medic! [amid the panic, a medic comes and extinguishes Kenny.]
Larsen
Woops.
Stan
Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!
Grandpa
You bastards!
Kyle
Hey!
Soldier
[off camera] We can't fire at them, sir. There are too many children.
Larsen
Then how do we stop them?
Stan
I know! But we'll have to wait until dark.
South Park, Kenny's house, morning. Mrs. McCormick comes out to pick up the day's mail. She finds a letter, opens it, and reads... (Another Ken Burns effect sequence starts with Cartman as General Lee
Cartman
Dear Ms. McCormick. It is with a very heavy heart that I must inform you that your son Kenny was killed in battle [her brows rise in surprise] on the morning of November 18, at Ruby Hills Funland in Chattanooga. This war has taken something from all of us, and, although your son seems to be the only casualty so far, know that we all share your pain. Your son did not die in vain. I shall persevere and make Stan and Kyle my slaves. Because I hate those guys. I hate them so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee.
The Confederate camp. The men relax and talk. Stan, Kyle, Grandpa, and Larsen sneak in...
Stan
There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
Grandpa
Nice thinkin', Billy.
Larsen
Let's go. [they proceed to carry the schnapps away]
Jimbo
[enters Cartman's tent] Where to next, General?
Cartman
[with pipe in mouth] Where did the Confederates go, son?
Jimbo
Well, I guess uh Fort Sumter in South Carolina. That's where the Civil War really escalated.
Cartman
Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
Jimbo
Welluh, that sounds great. I'm gonna get some s'more schnapps. You want anything?
Cartman
[turns around] Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
Jimbo
Um, sure. [exits to get some schnapps. He lifts a case and removes the lid, but finds the case empty. He takes a second case and again finds it empty] What the-? Ey, where's the s'more schnapps?
Randy
[with a guitar] We're out of s'more schnapps?
Mr. Garrison
[checks his empty bottle] That can't be.
Jimbo
I guess we drank it all.
Dawkins
Now what?
Stan
Now we just wait until morning. Check-mate, Cartman. Pretty soon, you're gonna be our slave.
Kyle
Yeah.
The Confederate camp, 7:29 A.M., next morning, 7 hours without schnapps.
Soldier 1
Uugh.
Soldier 2
Ouch.
Randy
[exits his tent] Oh, my head.
Gerald
Where am I?
Jimbo
[sits next to Ned on a bench] Ned, I think I can say without any doubt that that was the longest drinking binge we've ever had.
Ned
Mmm-oh. Gmm-oh, my head.
Mr. Garrison
[rises in his sleeping bag behind Stuart] Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.
Stuart
Me, too.
Jimbo
[stands] Well, come on everybody. We've got to get to the nearest bus station, quick.
Cartman
[at his tent entrance] Where are you going?
Jimbo
We're goin' home kid. Come on. [walks off]
Cartman
We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! [Randy stops by]
Randy
Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
Cartman
[watching the sober Confederates walk away] No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
Stan
[rushes up with Kyle and Grandpa] Haha! You lose, fatass!
Cartman
God, I hate you guys!
Kyle
Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history. [Cartman eyes a phone...] You see, history is forever, [...and an empty schnapps case next to it] and everything happens for a reason. [Cartman turns and walks] Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
Stan
Where are you going?
Cartman
This isn't over! Oh no! Oh no, not by a long shot! [Stan and Kyle just look at each other]
The long march home... The group is in a meadow.
Randy
Ogh. I don't believe we came all the way out here.
Jimbo
Yeah? Well, I don't think the bus station is too far from here.
Stuart
Uh, how much do you think a bus ticket back to Colorado is gonna run? [two schnapps trucks pull up and the drivers drop down. They head to the rears of the trucks and start unloading case after case of Jagermin's]
Suzette
Allo, I am Suzette, the S'more Schnapps girl. [Cartman gets out of the truck and walks up behind her] We are pleased to sponsor you with all the S'more Schnapps you need.
Randy
Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.
Gerald
Me neither.
Cartman
Uh uh come uh, come on, guys. Just one little drink. Uh a toast to how far you came and all that you saw.
Suzette
Yes, please. Do a shot out of my breasts. [pours two bottles into her cleavage]
Jimbo
Well, uh I guhess one little cheers is in order.
Soon, the men are drunk again and having a good time.
Jimbo
Hey, look! Ned's doin' his trick again! [Ned tumbles by wearing a fancy lampshade]
Mr. Garrison
[rushes up] Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of "grab ass."
Gerald
What's "grab ass?"
Mr. Garrison
You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
Randy
Ey, that sounds fun. [grabs Mr. Garrison's ass]
Mr. Garrison
Hohoho.
Solders
I got you. Oo-oh. [the men laugh and chase each other around trying to grab asses here and there]
Cartman
[intervenes] Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
Jimbo
You heard the General.
Soldiers
Yeah! [all charge out. Empty schnapps cases litter the field]
Stan
[reaches the scene a bit late] Oh, no.
Kyle
We'll never stop them now.
The March of War. Chattanooga, Tennessee, is struck, then Atlanta, Georgia; then eastern and southeastern Alabama, then Orlando, Florida. The group is on a log ride
Soldiers
Woohoo!
Cartman
Yes! Yes!
Southeast Georgia is struck, then Darling County, South Carolina.
Fort Sumter, day. A tour is taking place.
Guide
Throughout 1861 the Confederate authorities tried to drive out the Union occupants of Fort Sumter peacefully. But Abraham Lincoln's administration would not surrender the fort to the Confederates, so Jefferson Davis decided to take action.
Tourist
And the Confederates won the fort?
Guide
Yes. [turns and leads the group to the gates] Imagine what it must have been like: you're a Union soldier stationed at this fort, and one day, you look out and see thousands of Confederates ready to pounce on you. [the group stares in awe at the seemingly thousands of Confederates just outside the gate. The guide turns to see...] Uh...
Cartman
Take the fort!
Jimbo
Charge!
Men
Yeah! [they enter] Woohoo, yeah, come on!
Jimbo
We got it! The fort is ours! [a cannon blast knocks Randy down]
Randy
What was that?? [the National Guard has caught up with the Confederates and now surrounds the fort.]
Larsen
[on the bullhorn] Attention political activists: you are on government historical document property! Surrender the document with your hands up! If you would like a tour of the fort, one can be arranged through the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce.
Stan
[takes the bullhorn] Give up, fatass! There's over a hundred National Guards down here.
Cartman
Suck my ass!
Jimbo
What do we do, General? We're outnumbered.
Cartman
We asked the State of South Carlina for recruits. The reinforcements are bound to show up.
Larsen
Alright, that does it. Blow the whole thing up.
Stan
No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
Larsen
Sorry, son. We tried it your way; now we do it our way. Prepare the mortar.
Elderly Voice
Hold it right there! [The camera zooms out to show the rowdy reinforcements converge on Stan, Kyle, Grandpa, and the National Guard]
Jimbo
Wow, look at that! The entire state of South Carolina showed up! [other men grin with joy]
Cartman
I knew they would!
Stan
Aw, dammit!
Leader
[saluting] We're ready to fight with ya. Long live the Confederacy!
Men
Yee-haw! All right!
Cartman
Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
Washington D.C., 7:45 A.M., next day. The group has entered the city and are protesting outside the white house. The Million Confederate March?
Jimbo
Hey, government! You can't ignore our anguished cries anymore! You hear that?! You Government?! [Clinton looks out the window with two advisors]
Al Gore
Oh boy, this doesn't look good.
the three men turn away from the window
Advisor
It's just like the Million Man March, except that there actually are a million people.
Aide
Mr. President! A message for you from the extremists! [Clinton reads:]
Cartman
Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
Clinton
Oh, dear God! Wuh-we have to meet their demands.
Advisor
What?? Sir, there's- there's not that many of them.
Al Gore
As Vice-Persident, I think we'd better give them what they want. It's just the Southern states; who really needs them?
Clinton
My hands are tied. Tell General Lee that I'll meet him in front of the Capitol.
Aide
[salutes] Sir!
Al Gore
I'm so glad I don't have your job. [Clinton is surprised]
back outside in the raucous crowd
Stan
Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
Grandpa
Dammit, Billy, this isn't about you havin' to be slaves! This is about history! We can't let them change it!
Stan
Well, we've tried everything, Grandpa. What else can we do?
Grandpa
Wait a minute! They're all still doing a reenactment. What we have to do is play into that. Come on, Billy. You boys need a quick history lesson! [wheels away]
The Capitol, later. President Clinton is at a table on the Capitol with Gore and others
Clinton
All right, I'm gonna sign the document declarin' the Confederacy winners of the Civil War.
Confederates
[exulting] Hooray!
Jimbo
[to Cartman] Boy, we really got the President by the balls. Good thing you have that videotape of him and Marisa Tomei.
Cartman
I don't. I made it up. [Kyle and Stan approach Clinton as Lincoln and Davis, respectively]
Jimbo
Hey! Who's that?!
Kyle
Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
Stan
Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
Clinton
Boy, this just keeps getting weirder, doesn't it?
Cartman
What the hell are you guys doing?!
Jimbo
Ey, General, he's reenacting Jefferson Davis! You can't talk that way to a superior officer!
Stan
Men, I want you all to know that as President of the Confederacy, I am hereby surrendering.
Cartman
What?!
Kyle
Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
Confederates
Wow!
Randy
A whole year?
Jimbo
All right! Well, I think we got what we wanted.
Clinton
That's it? I-I don't have to sign this thing? [Kyle and Stan turn to each other and shake hands]
Gerald
Hey, come on. We should take a tour of the Smithsonian before we head back.
Cartman
No! We still have to fight!
Jimbo
[stops] Lincoln and Davis signed the treaty, General. The war is over.
Cartman
NOOO!!
Stan
[walks over with Kyle] It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!
Kyle
Yeah. And now you can take that stupid beard off! [tugs at it until it pulls off]
Cartman
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- [the camera zooms out for a view of the city, then the planet, then the Milky Way, then the binary-star system of Marklar, the Marklar themselves, then another planet, then the Visitors are seen...] -AAAH!
Clinton
[walks up and genuflects behind Stan and Kyle, patting each of them on the shoulder] Boys, as President of the United States, I want to commend you for stopping the rebel uprising.
Stan
Don't touch me. [Clinton stands up]
Kyle
Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
Cartman
Dammit! Dammit, I was so close! Dammit!
Stan
Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
Cartman
Wait a minute! I don't have to be your slave.
Kyle
What??
Cartman
The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
Clinton
Eh, he's right, boys. Slavery is illegal and immoral, partially in thanks to the North winning the Civil War.
Stan
Awwww!
Cartman
Hahahaha haa ha!
Stan
Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home. [he and Kyle walk away with Grandpa] Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
Kyle
Yeah. Thanks, dick!

Mailman and Kids
Mailman and Kids|[Mailman leads them] He's a piece of poo!

Mailman
Sometimes he's nutty [a girl holds a drawing],
sometimes he's corny [she shows the next drawing].
He can be brown or greenish brown [Mailman holds two sheets of construction paper].

Kids
Mmm-mmm.
Mailman
But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve,
He might come to your town. [a boy has made a Hankeyman and added smudges of real poo]

Mailman and Kids

Stick me in your mouth and try to say,

Girl 1
Sometimes he's runny.

Boy 1
Sometimes he's firm.

Girl 2
Sometimes he's practically water.

Man on Porto Potty
[opens the door] Sometimes he hangs off the end of your ass
And won't fall in the toilet
Cuz he's just clinging to your sphincter
And he won't drop off and so you ...shake your ass around
And try to get it to drop into the toilet
And finally it does.. [Timmy closes the door and clears his throat]

Mailman and Kids
[Mr. Hankey now leads them] Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo

Mailman
When Christmas leaves; he must leave too. [Santa lands with reindeer]

Mailman and Kids
[Mr. Hankey hops on and waves good-bye. They wave good-bye back]
Flush him down, but he's ne-ver gone!
[normal. Santa takes off] His smell and his spirit ling-ers on!

Kids
Howdy Ho!

Mr. Hankey is now shown seated on an armchair next to the crackling fireplace. Next to him is a small table with a gifts on it. Behind him is a Christmas tree with gifts at its base
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho, folks. We're gonna do somethin' a little bit different tonight. Instead of our normal thing, we're just gonna sit back and enjoy some holiday songs. And if ya don't like it, well, I guess you can suck my tiny little balls. So let's start off with a festive Hanukkah song, sung by my favorite Jewish person in the whole world.
The Broflovski house, decorated for Channukah. A dreidel spins on the living room rug. Kyle and Ike watch it spin and fall
Kyle
Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah. [picks it up] This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:

[begins to dance]
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
[gives the dreidel to Ike. Cartman walks in]

Cartman
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Kyle
Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
Cartman
Sure.
[takes it and walks up to the camera. Kyle sways to the song]
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.

Kyle
[stops] Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
Cartman
[moves to block Kyle from view. Kyle moves to the other side of the screen to be seen. They go back and forth like this for a while]
Jews.. ...play stupid games

Stan
Let me try. [takes it and spins it on the rug]
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.

Ike releases the dreidel, which spins successfully. The camera zooms in, only to see it fall.
Back at the armchair...
Mr. Hankey
Woohoo! Golly, that sure was fun. But now, for our next song, hold on to your bootstraps, 'cause we're gonna descend down into Hell!
Hell. Flames abound here, but an ashen plain is seen with a little campfire on it. Hitler, shown in shades of gray, is on his knees in front of the fire, crying. Before him is a tree stand, but there's no tree in it.
Adolf
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
wie treu sind deine Blätter.
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
[little Hitler is lifted up to put a star atop the Christmas tree]
wie treu sind deine Blätter.
De grünst nicht nur zur Sommerzeit,
[little Hitler beans a Jewish boy down with a snowball]
Nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.
[Little Hitler looks at trees, and has visions of marching soldiers. He salutes.]
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,
wie treu sind deine Blätter.
[live Nazi footage is superimposed on the fire. Hitler breaks down]

Satan
[walks up] Hey, Hitler. [turns to face him] What's the matter, little guy?
Adolf
Oh, oh Satan, der tannenbaum, wie treu sind deine Blätter.
Satan
Awww, you don't have a Christmas tree?
Adolf
…nur zur Sommerzeit, nein, auch im Winter, wenn es schneit.
Satan
[the damned appear around him] Well, I tell you what: Maybe we'll have ourselves a little Christmas, right here! Come on, everyone, gather 'round!
String up the lights and light up the tree.
We're gonna make some revelry!
Spirits are high, so I can tell,
[two of the damned stand up and dance]
It's Christmastime in Hell.

Demons are nicer as you pass them by.
[passes them in front of Azrael's Toys]
There's lots of demon toys to buy.
The snow is falling, and all is well.
[a volcano behind the store erupts]
It's

With Demons
Christmastime in Hell!

Satan
There goes Jeffrey Dahmer with a festive Christmas ham.
[Dahmer walks out of a meat store and into the house next door]
After he has sex with it, he'll eat up all he can.
And there goes John F. Kennedy, caroling with his son.
[they stop by to sing with him]

With the Kennedys
Reunited for the holidays, God bless us, everyone!

With the Damned
Everybody has a happy glow!
Let's dance in blood and pretend it's snow.

Satan
Even Mao Tse Tung is under the spell [Mao is making a snow angel]

With Choir
It's Christmastime in Hell!

Satan
Adolf, here's a present for you! [hands him a present]
Adolf
Oh? [opens the gift, it's the Christmas tree he wanted] Ein tannenbaum! [hugs it]
Satan
Yes, ein tannenbaum.
Females
Aaa-aaa!

Satan
God cast me down from heaven's door
[hops into a mining car and moves. Two demons man the front car]
To rule in Hell forevermore.
But now I'm kinda glad that I fell,

With Choir
'Cause it's Christmastime in Hell!

With Males
Here's a rack to hang the stockings on [...the type of rack with a man stretched out on it]

With Females
We still have to shop for Genghis Khan [seen]

Satan
Michael Landon's hair looks swell.

With Choir
It's Christmastime in Hell!

Satan
There's Princess Diana holding burning mistletoe
Over poor Gene Siskel's head; just watch his weenie grow.
[She does hold the mistletoe; Gene goes down on her]

With Choir
For one day we all stop burning, and the flames are not so thick. [a demon turns down the flames]
All the screaming and the torture stops as we wait for Ol' Saint Nick!
So, [Satan sets some cookies on a small table; a demon brings him an armchair]
String up the lights and light up the tree.
[with him are Mao, Gene, Diana, JFK Sr. and Jr., and Dahmer]
We're damned for all eternity.
But for just one day all is well.
It's Christmastime in Hell!!!

Satan
Gather close together and make it quick!
We gotta make room for Andy Dick.[shows the picture]

With Choir
[slowing, takes away the set] Wake his mother and ring the bell. It's... [three demons dress Satan in a green cape and Santa cap]

Satan and Males
[normal, on an altar] Christmastime...

Females
Christmastime... [demons carry Christmas ornaments]

Males
Christmastime... [other fly up with angel wings]

Females
Christmastime... [others dance around a burning tree]

Satan and Males
Christmastime... [Satan on the stage. In front of him...]

Females
Christmastime... [one demon flies up and left]

Males
It's Christmastime... [one flies up and right]

Females
Christmastime... [one flies straight up]

Mr. Hankey
Well, that was a nice little song, wasn't it? But let's not forget that for some people Christmas is about the birth of Jesus. So now, here's a more serious Christmas song, sung by Eric Cartman.
The town of Bethlehem. Cartman is superimposed on it. He's in formal wear.
Cartman
And...
O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning
[The Star of the Nativity appears, then the Three Wise Men]
It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth
[The Nativity and Cartman are seen in the background, Formal Cartman vanishes]
O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah.
[Formal Cartman before a starry sky]
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.
[Present-day Cartman finishes decorating the tree, helps himself to a pie]
Jesus was born, and so I get presents.
[Little Drummer Cartman stands before the manger scene, Present-day Cartman is seen tearing into his gifts back at home.]
Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)
[back at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman turns to look at Baby Jesus.]
Fall (Fall) [four angels appear behind Formal Cartman]
On your knees (On your knees) [Cartman falls on his knees]
And hear (Can't you hear)
The angels'.. something (Voices)
O night (O night)
[Present-day Cartman tosses in bed, which is covered in candy canes]
Divine (Divine)
[Formal Cartman] The night
When I get presents (O-o)
[at the manger, Little Drummer Cartman takes the gifts meant for Jesus]
O night (O o-night) [loads them up on his camel, with other presents]
Di-viiine! [Present-day Cartman rips into more presents at home]
[Formal Cartman] O night (Ooo-ooo)
O night, di-vine! [Little Drummer Cartman leads the gift-laden camels away]
Oh. Ah. Ch.

Back at the armchair..
Mr. Hankey
Well, oh boy, that was a super song! And now, let's hear from the school teacher, Mr. Garrison.
South Park Elementary. Class is in session. Mr. Garrison has drawn a world map on the board.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Today we're going to learn how different cultures around the world celebrate the holiday season.
Class
[flatly] Awww.
Kenny
(What?!)
Mr. Garrison
Now, pay attention. Ahem...
I heard there is no Christmas in the silly Middle East [points it out]
No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus; They have different religious beliefs
They believe in Muhammad, and not in our holiday.[shows some Arabic writing]
And so, every December I go to the Middle East and say, [tosses the picture away]

[In the Middle East]
Hey there, Mr. Muslim, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Put down that book, the Koran, and hear some holiday wishes [rips the Koran out of the Muslim's hand and dresses him up as a tree]
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday [removes the veils of two women]
So get off your heathen Muslim ass and fuckin' celebrate. [sticks a candy cane in the man's house]

There is no holiday season in India, I've heard. [pulls down a chart showing India's demerits.]
They don't hang up their stockings, and that is just absurd. [Stan and Kyle look at each other and shrug]
They've never read a Christmas story, they don't know what Rudolph is about.[holds up a book: "The Night Before Christmas"]
And that is why in December I'll go to India and shout,

[In India, next to a swami sitting on a bed of nails]
Hey there, Mr. Hinduist, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
Drink eggnog and eat some beef, and pass it to the Missus. [gives beef to one man, pours eggnog on another]
In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday. [wraps a few people in Christmas lights]
So get off your heathen Hindu ass and fuckin' celebrate. [passes out wreaths]

Now, I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.
On December 25th all they do is eat a cake.
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and say,

Hey there, Mr. Shintoist!, Merry Fuckin' Christmas!
God is gonna kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.
In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do. [throws some straw on the musicians]
So let's all rejoice for Jesus, and Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you. [knocks down the Shintoist and dumps gifts on him, and wraps others in lights]

[dressed as Santa, dances around the class]
On Christmas Day, I travel 'round the world and say,
"Taoists, Krishnas, Buddhists, and all you atheists, too!
Merry Fuckin' Christmas to you." [Mr. Hat claps]
Uh, thank you, Mr. Hat.

I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in [Stan sticks out his tongue and wiggles his hands on his ears]
On Christmas Day, in the morning. [Kyle pulls the ends of his lips apart and goes cock-eyed]

And what was in those ships, all three? [Stan starts to slurp on his fingers, then the boys chuckle]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And what- [turns and points at them]
Shut up, turds! [silence]
-was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, in the morning?

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there [Stan mimics Shelly with exaggerated expression, Kyle stifles a laugh]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day [Kyle cracks up]
The Virgin Mary and-
Shut up, TUUUURDS! [The boys cover their mouths. Kyle stifles his laughing]
-Christ were there
On Christmas Day, in the morning.

Let us all rejoice, amain, [Stan pulls his cap over his face, Kyle flaps his ear flaps]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day [the boys burst our laughing]
And let- [walks to the boys]
I told you to shut up! [Stan stifles his laugh]
[back at the piano] -us all rejoice, amain,
On Christmas Day, in the morning. [the boys make faces again]

Shelly is starting to get pissed [the boys begin to chuckle]
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day [the chuckle get louder]
Shelly got up and killed the turds [the laughs roll out]

Mr. Hankey
Golly, that sure was swell. I'd say my Christmas special is going super-fantastic. Well, now it's time to hear from perhaps the two most important people of the whole season.
McKemick's Night Club. Tonight: Jesus and Saint Nick. A man goes towards the club.
Emcee
Hello, everyone, and welcome to McKemick's. Now, please put your hands together and welcome... Saint Nicholas and Jesus Christ. [Jesus and Santa enter on stage, and the audience claps]
Santa
Hello, everybody!
Jesus
[waves] How are y'all doing tonight?
Santa
You know, Jesus, there've been so many songs written about us over the years.
Jesus
That's right, Santa, and we love each and every one of them. Like this one.
Joy to the world, for I have come.
Let earth receive Me!
Let every heart prepare Me room. [gets some applause]

Santa
And heaven and nature sing...

Jesus
And heaven and nature sing...

Santa
And heaven and nature sing...

Jesus
And heaven and na-

Both
And heaven and heaven and nature sing.

Santa
You know, Jesus, that is a nice song, but I like... this one:
Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old... me. [get some applause]
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones' Christmas joys

Both
[sway together]
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?
Ho ho ho! Who wouldn't go?

Santa
Up on the housetop, click click click.
Down through the chimney with good old... me.

Jesus
He he hoo, get away! [pushes him away]
Santa
Go away??
Jesus
Get away.
Santa
Where away?
Jesus
[gets some applause]
Away in the manger, no crib for My bed
That's where cute little old Me lay down My sweet head.
The stars in the sky (Santa: Ooooo)

Both
Looked down where I lay.

Jesus
Cute little eight-pound me (Santa: Oo-oo)

Both
asleep in (Santa: on) the hay.

Jesus
[gets some applause and sings upbeat]
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye to Bethlehem to see-ee Me...

Santa
Here's one,
Jol-

Jesus
Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory-

Santa
Hey, it's my turn.
Jesus
-to Me!
Silent Night,

Santa
Uh.
Jesus
Holy Night

Santa
Santa Cl- em

Jesus
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Me.

Santa
Saint Nicholas... can't think of one.

Jesus
Holy Me, so tender and mild.
Sleep in heavenly peace.
[slowing] Sleep in heavenly peace.

Santa
Okay, Jesus. Here's one you might remember:
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twistin' through the dusty land.

Jesus
Uh. Santa, Santa, Santa, that's not a Christmas song, bud. Ah... that's-
Santa
I know, but there's, like, three-hundred Jesus Christmas songs and only four fucking Santa ones! It's not fair! Just do it yourself! I'm leaving. [walks off the stage]
Jesus
Aw, come on, Santa. You can't leave.
Santa
Aw, fuck you, Jesus!
Jesus
But Santa... The weather outside is frightful
Santa
[offscreen] Aw.
Jesus
But the fire so delightful

Santa
[returns to the stage] Well, since I've no place to go.

Both
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. [more applause]

Jesus
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'.

Santa
But I brought some corn for poopity-poppin'.

Jesus
The lights are turned way down low, so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
[Santa: Snow... snow... snow.]

Both
The fire is slowly dyin',

Santa
And, my dear, we're still good-bop-be-byein',

Jesus
But as long as you love me so,

Both
[they dance and hold hands, then Jesus twirls him. Santa spins off the stage]
Let it snow, let it snow,

Jesus
let it snow!

Santa
[slides back on stage on his knees]
Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand!

Well, I guess that's about the end of my Christmas album. Gosh! It was sure nice hangin' out with y'all again. Well, I guess if there's just... one thing I have left to say, it would be this:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
May your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay. [hops out of the bowl]
From now on, our troubles will be miles away.

South Park, Main Street, day. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny walk towards Tom's Rhinoplasty. Some adults walk by them as a station wagon rolls by. On the buildings are posters of Father Time and Baby New Year.

Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.

I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!

I've become a man! I started puberty, you guys! [grins]

No you didn't!

Yes! I really did.
Stan
How do you know?
Cartman
Well, because yesterday I got my period. [lets the words hang there for a moment]
Kyle
You got your what?
Cartman
My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
Stan
You're making that up! [a woman steps out of a small building, and he addresses her] Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
Miss Aliton
Well boys, ah-I don't think I can tell you. Ah-
Stan
Please, it's important.
Miss Aliton
Well, it's when puberty hits and you bleed, you know, down there. [points to the region]
Kyle
Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! [Miss Aliton turns and walks away. The boys turn to face Cartman]
Cartman
Well guys, I'm afraid I won't be able to hang out with you on New Year's Eve. I have to hang out with the older crowd because now, I'm ma-ture. [begins to dance away backwards] I got my period, and you guys didn't. I got my period, and you guys didn't. [skips out of view]

In local news, a stomach virus is going around that is causing bleeding of the colon in some small children. Doctors are telling parents that the virus is nothing to worry about and that the infections can be dealt with simple antibiotics. [turns to face another camera, and a new picture, "New Year's Eve 1999" appears] Well, it's just four days until New Year's Eve, 1999. The new millennium is almost upon us, and all over the world people have started to celebrate by dancing, singing, and killing one another. [In New York, amid burning buildings, one man beats another man over the head with a bat. In Paris, people drop down from on high, and in Beijing people torch each other] But probably the biggest event of the millennium is one happening in South Park, Colorado, where people have gathered for a chance to see Jesus Christ. Craig Netzel is standing by.
Reporter Craig Netzel in South Park. Television cameras are everywhere
Netzel
Thanks, Tom. It is indeed four days until the new millennium, and hundreds if not thousands of people have come from all over the world seeking Jesus, here at his house in South Park. [the camera begins to pan to the right. A man with two kids next to him sit in chairs. Skeeter and his friends are there, too] Everyone is giddy with anticipation for Jesus to come out, because as we all know, if Jesus comes out of his house and is not scared by his shadow, it means the next thousand years will be full of peace and love. [the front door opens] Oh, it looks like Jesus might be coming out! [turns to face the house. Jesus peeks out from it]
Woman
[picks up her son and points Jesus out] Oh look, Tommy. There he is. Can you see him?
Boy
He's neat, Mommy. [cameras go off as the crowd stands behind some "Jesus line. Do not cross" lines. Jesus drops back into his house, then peeks out again]
Netzel
[softly] Everyone is quiet here, Tom. Looks like the little fellow's a bit nervous. [Jesus moves forward] But he has taken another step out, Tom! This is great new for us!
Jesus
Uh-mmm, um what are you people doing? [people lower their cameras, puzzled] Can I help you with something? [no one moves]

Hello?
Kyle
Dude, did you get your period yet?
Stan
No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
Kyle
Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
Stan
Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.

Stan
Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
Cartman
Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people. [drops the Breeze and picks up the Plug-Ups. Softly] Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.

Cartman
[pleased] You did?
Kyle
You got your period too, Kenny?
Kenny
(Yeah, it was awesome! I was just sitting down and then I got my period!)
Cartman
Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve. [Stan shrugs, but looks worried] But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
Kenny
[exults] (Woo-hoo!)
Jesus' house. The crowd awaits his decision. Inside, Jesus paces the floor
Netzel
[from the TV] Tom, it looked for a second as if Jesus was going to come out of his house, but then he went back inside. But meanwhile, more and more people are showing up to show their support for Jesus. [a man holds up a sign saying: "It's the end of the MILLENIUM. Please don't kill us JESUS". Jesus looks in wonder]
Rancher
[holding a Bible] Well, the way I see it, if he really is who he says he is, well then he'd better do somethin' on New Year's Eve, 'cause it's in the Bible!
Jesus
[sighs heavily] Father, I need to talk to you. Please, Father, appear to me. [a flash of light and swirling clouds follow as Jesus comes forward to meet his father]
God
[voice-over] What is it, my child?
Jesus
Father, everyone is starting to pay attention to me again because of the new millennium. Huh-I'm kinda making a comeback!
God
Yea, like John Travolta before you. You are experiencing a second revival.
Jesus
It's the millennium, Father. People want to see you.
God
Nay, their eyes are not yet prepared to see the likes of me.
Jesus
But dad, I think this may be my one big shot at a comeback.
God
Be ye careful of pride, Jesus.
Jesus
Just make an appearance. You can come down, say 'hi' to a few people and can be back by 12:30.
God
I'm sorry, my son, but if you want to earn everyone's love, you will have to do it yourself.
The Broflovski house, living room, day. Ike is playing with a set of blocks. Kyle approaches him.
Kyle
Ike, can I talk to you? [sits down next to Ike]
Ike
Uh ar, stufid.
Kyle
Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
Ike
Whoa won toooo-reeee.
Kyle
Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
Ike
No. Martur sucker. Moghee. Muckeh m'gwoss. Tabyudog.
Kyle
Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
Ike
Cokeh mocker.
Kyle
[stands and moves out] Thanks a lot, Ike!
The bus stop, day. Stan, Kenny and Cartman are hanging out there.
Stan
So you guys aren't gonna spend New Year's Eve with us?
Cartman
Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
Kenny
(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
Cartman
Tampon? What's a tampon?
Kenny
(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)
Cartman
Ew, doesn't that hurt?
Kenny
(A little.)
Kyle
[rushes up quite excited] You guys! I got my period, too!
Cartman
Wow, cool!
Stan
[frightened] You did?
Kyle
Yeah! [Stan looks down sadly] I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
Cartman
All right! You have to be in me and Kenny's club, then. My mom gave me this "Women Who Run With The Wolves" book and I'm finding out all about our goddess powers.
Kyle
Awesome! We get powers?
Cartman
Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve! [Stan is left alone, but Cartman returns] Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. [walks away]
Stan's room, night. He's ready for bed, but sits at his desk with pencil and paper at the ready. He picks the pencil up and writes
Stan
Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan [He sets his pencil down and goes to bed]
Jesus' house, outside, night. The camera crews and crowd keep vigil. One window on the house is lit from within
Jesus
Are you there, God? It's me, Jesus. I feel like I've got a real shot at a comeback, God. For whatever reason, people are starting to follow me again. I'm 2000 years old, but I feel like I'm 28 again! I think I'm going to win everybody back, because I just made a few phone calls, and I'm going to put on the most amazing New Year's spectacle this world has ever seen!
The Marsh house, Stan's room, day. An alarm goes off, and Terrance and Phillip are heard.
Phillip
[a rooster crows] Oh God, you're smelly!
Announcer
Good morning, South Park, it's 8 a.m., [Stan awakens] and only two more days until the new millennium! [Stan moves towards the radio, than away from it, then hides under the covers, then sprints for the restroom. Quickly, he lowers his pajamas and briefs]
Stan
Dammit! Dammit dammit dammit!
Sharon
Stanley, honey, what's the matter?
Stan
[sobbing] I'm not bleeding out my aahass!
Sharon
Well, that's good, honey.
Stan
No it's not! It's terrible! [Sharon looks worried. Stan returns to his bed and prays] Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
Jesus' house, day, one day before New Year's eve. The camera crews and crowd keep vigil. A woman yawns, and the front door opens again
Jimbo
Here he comes!
Mr. Garrison
He's coming out!
Jesus
[steps out and closes the door] ...I have given it much thought, my children, and you are right. After reviewing the Bible, it does indeed say that something very big is going to happen at the millennium. [the crowd cheers and jumps for joy] I have spoken to my Father in heaven, and he agreed that the millennium is significant to all of us. And ye who believe in me SHALL be rewarded! [more cheering and jumping] So what we're going to do tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, 1999: we just got ROD STEWART to agree to play a comeback concert at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and you're all going! [...silence]
Man
...We knew you could do it, Jesus! [the crowd begins to cheer again, and Jesus grins]
Mr. Garrison
Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas! [hurries away]
Fr. Maxi
[beings to sing. Others step aside]
For he is Savior
For he is Lord

Crowd
He gives me hope when
I have only been bored
And he lifts me up with
His gentle arm...

The Ewok Village 2000. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny sit in a circle with candles next to them.
Cartman
[wearing a bandana and flowers] Okay, is everyone accounted for? Goddess Wind?
Kyle
[with bandana and leafy wings] Here.
Cartman
Goddess Moon? Goddess Moon?!
Kenny
[with fine pendant on his hood and purple cape] (Dammit, here!)
Cartman
And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
Kyle
I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
Kenny
(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
Cartman
Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
Kyle
Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
Cartman
What's the matter, Kyle?
Kyle
Nothing. Um [clears his throat], my period is really uuuh... [Cartman looks on skeptically] Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
Cartman
...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
Kenny
(And mine too.)
Kyle
[sighs] Phew.
Chef's house. Stan walks up and knocks
Chef
[opens the door] Oh, hello Stan.
Stan
[despondent] Hey, Chef.
Chef
How's it going?
Stan
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Stan
Can I come in?
Chef
Well, sure. [Stan enters and Chef closes the door. They sit on the sofa] Now, what's the matter, little cracker?
Stan
Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
Chef
OOH, you're talkin' about your older sister, Shelly.
Stan
No.
Chef
Your little girlfriend, Wendy.
Stan
Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
Chef
Look, Stan. Do you really know what a period is?
Stan
Yeah, Cartman told us.
Chef
Stan, let me sing you a little song about the menstrual cycle. I think it might clear things up for you. [gets up and faces him]
Stan
Okay.
Chef
Ooo baby, yeah baby, ooo baby.
Yeah baby, yeah baby, now baby.
Ooo yeah, yes yes baby
Yeahyeahyeah, uh-huh baby now
Agh! Agh! Awww! No, baby!
Ewww, baby! No, no!
Alright now—I'm alright, I'm-I'm cool, it's okay.
Uh alright, watch out for the bedspread, baby.
Look out now, it's- alright, I'll tell you what.
Uuh, how about uuh, uh.
Why don't I call you next week?
And that's my song about the menstrual cycle, Stan. Did that clear things up for you?

Stan
[thinks] ...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.
Chef
...Is that what I said?
Stan
But it's not fair! It's not fair that one day you're on top, that you're the coolest kid in town, and then the next day you're at the bottom again, 'cause everyone has blood coming out their ass but you, and if I can't menstruate, then by God, I'm not gonna sit around and be the only periodless 8-year-old boy! I'm gonna do something about it! [hops off and heads out the door.]
Chef
Whoa! I musta missed a WHOLE middle part there.
Rod Stewart's mansion, day. Jesus sits on a leather sofa with Stewart's agent. Around them are Grammys, some pictures of Stewart and framed gold records
Agent
I can't tell you how excited Rod Stewart is about this millennium concert. He's gotten a little older, but you're gonna see how much he can still rock.
Jesus
Hoh, I'm excited too. I think it will bring my Father's children back to their faith and back to mine eyes, for I an the Lamb of God.
Agent
Yeah t-and uh, you know, Rod is a seasoned veteran, so I'm gonna have to ask for a bit more cash, but we could talk about that later; here comes Rod now. [some double doors open, and a nurse wheels Rod into the room]
Rod
Hullo-o-o.
Jesus
[surprised, but quickly recovers and shakes Rod's hand] Hey, Rod, great to see you.
Rod
Oh.
Jesus
Uh, the folks are sure glad you're playing. It's really given them a lot of faith in me again. I'm sure that together, we can make this millennium party the best New Year's bash ever!
Rod
Pooped pants.
Jesus
What?
Rod
Pooped pants.
Jesus
Poo pants?
Rod
Pooped 'nmuh pants.
Jesus
Uh, you pooped your pants?
Rod
Pooped in my pants.
Jesus
Oh Uh-n nurse? Mr. Stewart has apparently pooped his pants?
Nurse
Again?! [turns Rod around to wheel him away] Now, Mr. Stewart, what did we say about trying to hold in Mr. Dookie? [exits with Rod. Jesus can only look on, shocked]
Genetic Engineering Ranch, night
Dr. Mephesto
[leading Stan into the lab] Yes, puberty is a very wonderful thing, Stan. It's what links us all together, makes us one.
Stan
But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
Dr. Mephesto
Never went through puberty? Who never went through puberty?
Stan
Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.
Dr. Mephesto
Your father never went through puberty?
Stan
No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
Dr. Mephesto
Oh, I can't say that I blame him.
Stan
So do you know anything that can help him?
Dr. Mephesto
Well, I should think the most logical solution would be... hormones.
Stan
Hormones? [smiles. Mephesto takes him to the medicine cabinet]
Dr. Mephesto
Yes! [removes a bottle of PURE HORMONES] Here, and tell your father to take just one of these pills every week. It could be just what he needs. And be sure to tell him that his secret is safe with me.
Stan
Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! [walks away with the bottle]
Dr. Mephesto
My pleasure. I just love helping people.
Genetic Engineering Ranch, outside. Stan looks at the bottle and reads the prescription:
"one tablet weekly." He pops the lid off... One tablet falls, and then the empty bottle.

The Ewok Village 2000, next day. Cartman, Kyle, and Kenny have reassembled.
Cartman
Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. [tips the bowl towards Kyle, who reaches in and takes a slip of paper]
Kyle
[unfurls and reads] Okay. Today's word is "spirituality." What that means to me is uh- [thump. The three look up]
Stan
[outside, below] Hey assholes! [the three rise and head for a window]
Cartman
Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
Stan
[now with some facial hair] Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
Kyle
Hormones?
Stan
Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
Kyle
Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
Cartman
Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
Stan
So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
Cartman
Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
Stan
[voice breaking] Aaaargh. I'm gonna go take some more hormones. [walks away. The other three withdraw and resume their discussion]
Cartman
Now, the word is "spirituality." I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
Kenny
(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.) [leans forward in pain]
Cartman
Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
Kenny
(Oh- ooowww!)
Cartman
Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
Kenny
(Aaaaaa!) [falls back and passes out. Blood spews up from his mouth]
Kyle
Whoa, dude!
Hell's Pass Hospital. An ambulance is parked outside. Inside, the McCormick parents sit in the waiting room holding hands
Dr. Doctor
Mr. and Ms. McCormick.
McCormick Parents
Yes?
Dr. Doctor
I'm sorry. We... couldn't save your son.
Ms. McCormick
[sobbing] Oh my God, my little Kenny's gone. I can't believe it.
Dr. Doctor
We just didn't get to him in time. There's nothing we could do.
Stuart
What happened? What killed him, doctor?
Dr. Doctor
Well, we found a... tampon stuck up your child's ass. Apparently, he'd had it up there for several days. It plugged him up until he finally burst from the inside out like a ruptured septic tank.
Ms. McCormick
[sobbing] Oh my God.
Dr. Doctor
My worry is that he could have been following some kind of crazy new fad. Perhaps the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the Backstreet Boys doing it on TV or something.
Ms. McCormick
[sobbing] Gi-ih [gulp]
Dr. Doctor
We must get to the bottom of this! ...if you'll pardon the pun. But actually, right now, I've got to catch a plane to Las Vegas to see the Rod Stewart Millennium Show.
Stuart
Rod Stewart's gonna be in Vegas?
Las Vegas, night. Klieg lights search the sky as a large crowd gathers for the concert. Craig Netzel is on scene
Netzel
Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas, where tomorrow night THE New Year's Eve event is going to happen. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, is presenting Rod Stewart, the undisputed King of Pop, right here at this hotel behind me. [tents and stands pepper the grounds. Some of them have been seen in South Park before] It looks as though Jesus really has come through. [Jesus is in his room looking at the report] Everyone is very excited, because rumor has it that God Himself is gonna show up to the event.
Jesus
[shocked] What??
Netzel
How about you, ma'am? Do you think God is gonna show up tomorrow night?
Ma'am
[in party hat] Of course he is. This is Jesus we're talking about. He wouldn't let us down.
Jesus
[turns off the TV] Oh no! Are you there, God? Father, will you please reconsider and show up tomorrow? [no answer] ...Hello?
New Year's Eve, morning. Stan's radio alarm goes off
Sharon
Stanley. [Stan awakes. A beard is forming] Wake up, honey. It's time to leave for Las Vegas. [he jumps out of bed and walks past a Terrance and Phillip full-length mirror. He stops, walks backwards, and looks at his reflection, strokes his sparse beard, turns to look at himself from the side...]
Stan
Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.
Las Vegas, New Year's Eve, 1999, night. The stage area. The crowds erupts in anticipation
Cartman
[walks in with Kyle] Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. [Jesus takes the stage and speaks]
Jesus
Alright, people. Are we ready to rock the millennium?! [the crowd roars. Jesus steps backstage and prays] Father in heaven, please let tonight's show go well. Please make them like it.
Kyle
[Butters is already next to Cartman] Hey, here comes Stan.
Stan
[walks up, with a deep boy voice] Have I missed anything?
Cartman
Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
Kyle
Did you get your period yet, Stan?
Stan
No. I didn't, but-
Cartman
Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. [he and Kyle walk off]
Jesus
Well, I tell you one thing. I sure as heck am excited. We've got about four hours to the new year, and so I think it's time to START IT UP! Ladies and gentlemen, as promised, Mr. Rod "Do You Think I'm Sexy?" Stewart! [the curtains open as Jesus steps aside. The nurse rolls Rod up to the mic and walks away as the band plays. The crowd has no reaction. The band pauses after a while, so Rod can sing]
Rod
O-o-oh. [the band riffs a bit] O-oh. [the band plays on. Jesus keeps time] O-o-o-oh. Be-eh-o-o-or. [Stan walks around and then sits on a curb, truly depressed. Rod continues to sing unintelligibly]
Jimbo
[disgusted] Whoa, man.
Rod
Oh. Uh pooped 'em. [the band resumes play as the nurse brings a bucket on stage and checks him out]
Mr. Garrison
This sucks balls!
Blonde
Yeah!
Man 7
Alright, enough of this! Bring out God!
Man 9
Yeah!
Jesus
Oh no.
Crowd
We want God! We want God! We want God!
Jesus
["We want God"] Please, Father. Do something.
Crowd
We want God!
Jesus
[goes onstage again] Uh, folks, I'm afraid God can't make it tonight.
Randy
We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
Woman
This is the worst New Year's ever! Thanks a lot, Jesus!
Skeeter
Let's get him! [leads the charge to the stage]
Craig Netzel with some breaking news. The crowd has begun to riot.
Netzel
Well, Tom, I'm here live in Las Vegas in what is quickly becoming known as "the gayest party ever." Everyone is so outraged that they are building a large cross in which to once again crucify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. [behind him, two men pop in and out of view. One holds a bat, the other runs back and forth. The man with the bat beats the other man down, but the other man pops up and continues running]
Stan
[goes onstage] Jesus, why does God hate me?
Jesus
Huh? He doesn't hate you, he hates me. He's gonna let me be crucified again.
Stan
He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
Jesus
Well, yeah, but just because God doesn't answer your prayers doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.
Stan
Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
Jesus
Well, God can't just answer every prayer and suddenly give you everything you want. That takes all the living out of life.
Stan
What do you mean?
Jesus
If God answered all our prayers, there'd be nothing left for us to do ourselves. Life is about problems, and overcoming those problems. [becomes reflective] A-and growing and learning from obstacles. If God just fixed everything for us, then there'd be no point in our existence. [realizes something] That's why he wouldn't show up to my New Year's party.
Stan
I just wanted my period.
Jesus
I get it now, Father. I had to learn all this on my own. [Skeeter and five other men bring a large cross in] I was overcome with my new popularity and, and I let pride get in the way of good judgment. [a bright light appears in the sky and descends towards the stage. The crowd gapes in awe]
Man
Whoa, what is that??
Jesus
[the light approaches him] It's Dad.
Fr. Maxi
God? God is going to show himself??
Woman
Look, I can see him. [the light begins to bathe the crowd]
Jesus
Father. You came.
God
Now look upon Me, My children, and know Me. [now the crowd is shocked] Be ye not afraid. [God is shown as some kind of short-legged squirrel, elephant, cat, hippopotamus hybrid] Blessed art thou, my children. [a man's party blower falls from his lips]
Randy
That's God?
Jesus
Yea, 'tis my Father, the Creator. He is the Alpha and the Omega. [a snake's tongue lashes out from God's mouth] The Beginning and the End.
Mr. Garrison
Well, yeah, but that??
God
What did you expect me to look like, My son?
Mr. Garrison
[thinks a moment] ...Well not like that!
God
Since it is the end of the first 2000 years, I will allow you, My children, to ask me one question.
Gerald
[next to Mr. Mackey] One question?
Mr. Mackey
Only one?
Sharon
What should we ask him?
Chef
We have to think carefully. We can ask him anything we want, like, "What's the meaning of life?" or "Why are we here?".
Stan
I have it. I have the question. [steps forth] Now you have to answer me once and for all! How come I haven't gotten my period yet?! [the crowd stands aghast]
God
[after a while] My child, you are a boy. Boys do not get periods. That's only for girls. Your friends were bleeding a little bit out of their asses because of an acute colon infection. And your friend Kyle simply lied about it.
Kyle
[exposed] How do know that?
God
You will hit puberty when the time is right. But you will never have a period, because you are a man — with titties. Thus spaketh the Lord. And now I return to heaven. [transforms into the light and returns the way he came]
Mr. Garrison
Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??
God
I'll answer another on New Year's Eve, in the year 4000. [zips away]
Stan
Did you hear that everybody? I'm not even supposed to have my period; that's why God wasn't answering me before! [people look at him, annoyed] Boy, I'm sure everything worked out okay. [looks around] I guess now we can all celebrate the New Year, huh?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
[end credits roll]
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne...

Skeeter
Let's get him.
Stan
Let's have a cup o

End of Are You There God? It's Me, Jesus

World Wide Recorder Concert
A promo is the first thing shown. Live-action shots throughout
Announcer
This Saturday, Pox presents the musical event of the new millennium! You all remember playing the recorder in elementary school! [a recorder resting on a book of sheet music is shown] Well, this Saturday in Oklahoma City [its skyline is shown], over 4 million third-grade students [a crowd of them is shown] from all over the country [a school bus full of students is shown] will gather in one place, and at the same time, play "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" on their recorders. [a girl is shown playing a white one] It's the largest third-grade recorder concert ever! [An elderly man instructs three students, one of them in a wheelchair] Special guest conductor Yoko Ono [pictured] and woodwind virtuoso Kenny G [pictured] will lead this fantastic event! This Saturday, at 11 Eastern / 10 Central. The world will be watching! [close-up of a small boy playing his recorder]
South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's classroom. He rushes to the front of the class and stands next to a pull-down screen on which is projected "My Country 'Tis Of Thee"
Mr. Garrison
Okay children, we've still got some time to practice the song before we load up the bus and head out for Oklahoma.
Class:
[groaning] Awww.
Mr. Garrison
Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?! [raises his baton] Recorders up. [the students set their recorders between their lips] And a-1 and a-2 and a- [the class begins to play the song. Some students play slow] "...of liberty." You're late! [the kids play faster, but are still off] "...my father-" What the hell was that?! [the students lower their recorders] God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!
Cartman
That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
Kyle
[Kenny laughs] Shut up, fatass!
Cartman
Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. [Kenny laughs so hard he falls off his seat]
Mr. Garrison
Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up. [the students set their recorders between their lips] And a-1 and a-2 and a- [the class begins to play the song. Mr. Garrison genuflects and bangs his head against his desk. Mr. Mackey walks in, looking at this behavior]
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, that sounded great, kids. [Mr. Garrison looks up at him]
Mr. Garrison
[rising] Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas.
Mr. Garrison
[close-up. He's suddenly scared] Arkansas?
Stan
What's Arkansas—is that a state?
Mr. Mackey
Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay? [hands them out. Craig reads his sheet.]
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you for a second?
Mr. Mackey
M'kay. [joins Mr. Garrison aside]
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.
Mr. Mackey
What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
Mr. Garrison
[wistfully] Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there—my [stifles a sob] ...father still lives there.
Mr. Mackey
Well, don't you want to see them?
Mr. Garrison
I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay? [walks him over to a chair and sits him down] Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?
Mr. Garrison
...Some, yes. There was my uncle, Richard. He... he molested me.
Mr. Mackey
When was that?
Mr. Garrison
Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, eh, and your father? He molested you when you were a boy? [Mr. Garrison begins to cry] Mr. Garrison, I think, when we get to Arkansas, you need to see your father. You need to face this demon in your closet, m'kay?
Mr. Garrison
[turns away] Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! [hurries out of the classroom crying]
Cartman
That was pretty cool.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay.
The trip begins. Inside the bus, Mr. Mackey is up front reading a book, Mr. Garrison is in the very back opposite Terrence and the redhead
Cartman
[with recorder] Okay, how about this one, Kenny? [plays an A note]
Kenny
(Uh-uh.)
Cartman
No? How about this? [plays a G note]
Kenny
(Nope.)
Cartman
Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? [plays a Gb note. Kyle and Stan turn around on their seat]
Kyle
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Cartman
We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
Stan
What's "lose bowel control?"
Cartman
That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
Kyle
Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
Cartman
Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
Kyle
Nuh-uh!
Cartman
How about this one, Kenny? [plays an F note]
Kenny
(Nuh-uh.)
Kyle
There is no brown noise, fat boy!
Cartman
That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
Stan
Who's Karen Carpenter?
Mr. Garrison
Aaaaaah! [apparently, he's seen a sign that reads: "Arkansas 410 miles. Rest Stop 5 miles"] Huhh, ohh, [the students and Mr. Mackey look back.]
Mr. Mackey
Mr. Garrison, are you alright?
Mr. Hat
Mr. Garrison isn't here right now.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?
Mr. Hat
Oh, good one, Sherlock! You figure that out all by yourself?!
Mr. Mackey
M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
Mr. Hat
No! No, you moron! [Mr. Mackey gets annoyed] Mr. Garrison can't let the memories end! Just leave us alone!
Mr. Mackey
M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!
Mr. Hat
Why would he want to talk to a second-rate dopey-ass elementary-school psychologist?!
Mr. Mackey
What did you say?!
Mr. Hat
You heard me, jackass! There's monkeys that make better counselors than you!
Mr. Mackey
Why, you son of a bitch! [rips Mr. Hat from Mr. Garrison's hand and starts beating him up. Mr. Hat smacks Mr. Mackey down in front of Terrence, who looks aghast]
Stan
Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. [the other students turn to see the fight]
Mr. Mackey
I'm gonna kick your ass, m'kay?! [resumes fighting Mr. Hat]
Students
[cheering] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Ms. Crabtree
BE QUIET BACK THERE!
Mr. Mackey
Yuh-NO! [panting, dirty and black-eyed, gets up and places Mr. Hat between Mr. Garrison's arms] You may have won this time, Mr. Hat.
The journey continues. The school bus and its passengers finally reach their destination - a large lot filled with buses and tents, and children
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!
Coordinator
[a female with clipboard, walking up] School?
Mr. Mackey
Excuse me?
Coordinator
What school are you from?
Mr. Mackey
Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?
Coordinator
Ssss, alright. South Park school, you go over there next to the kids from New York. [distracted by something away from the bus] Nono, don't put the Florida kids in the building! [moves away. The class walks past the New York children]
Tough Guy 1
[sitting on the bus's front right fender] Ey! Look at the little Eskimos in their freakin' hats and gloves.
Tough Guy 2
Yeah, huh? [they begin to snicker as the South Park kids look back]
Tough Guy 1
Whoa, look at this kid's coat. [Kenny's] Ey, kid. What's the matter—you a freakin' burn victim or somethin'? What? [the others laugh]
Kyle
[aside, to Stan] Who the hell are these guys?
Tough Guy 1
I didn't know they was invitin' rednecks to this event!
Stan
We're not rednecks!
Kyle
Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
Tough Guy 1
Oh yeah? Well, you look like a bunch of queefs to me, huh?! [the other New Yorkers laugh]
Cartman
[aside, to Stan, softly] Stan, what's a queef?
Kyle
Kenny?
Kenny
(I don't know!)
Tough Guy 1
Oh, brother! You guys don't even know what a queef is, huh?!
Cartman
Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
Black kid
[wearing EKKO shirt] Oh yeah? Well, what is it, then?!
Cartman
Aaaa-
Stan
Why?! Don't you know?!
Tough Guy 1
Are all redneck queefs from Colorado as stupid as youse?!
Kyle
Alright, dickhole! [feedback is heard, and all look to the source]
Coordinator
[on bullhorn] I need everyone's attention, please! We will now all be moving in an orderly fashion to our assigned hotels. Please follow your group leader to check in.
Tough Guy 1
[as South Park leaves] Yeah see ya later, queefs! [at least Stan and Kyle are pissed off. They look angry as they look at each other]
Roman Holiday Inn, night. The four boys share a room with two beds. They sit amid stacks of books looking for information
Kyle
Ungh, I can't find the word "queef" anywhere! [drops his book]
Stan
[reading another book] Well keep looking! We gotta find out what it means before we see those New Yorker kids again!
Kyle
Well, let's try the dictionary. [picks it up] queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
Stan
Damnit! [closes his book]
Cartman
[reading another book, jumps for joy] Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
Stan
You did? [the other three gather around]
Kyle
What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
Cartman
I told you guys! Here it is, right here. "The brown noise."
Kyle
Awwgh!
Stan
Damnit Cartman, wha-?!
Cartman
"An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen." See? That means crap your pants. "The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb." What does that mean?
Stan
Who cares? We have to find out what queef means! Keep reading! [he and the other two return to their books and read on]
Garrison's home town, night. He walks to his former home, his parents' house, in the rain
Mr. Garrison
[on the walkway, sighs] I can do this. I have to do this. [approaches the door and rings the bell. His father answers] Hello. Dad.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Oh, hello, son.
Mr. Garrison
Can I ...come in?
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Ub. Sure, of course. [Mr. Garrison enters] Your mom's out at Bridge Night. You want a beer or somethin'?
Mr. Garrison
No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Uh, what?
Mr. Garrison
I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Uh, okay, like what?
Mr. Garrison
Alright, alright, let's just cut right to it! [sighs] I've come to ask you about the sexual abuse, dad!
Mr. Garrison Sr.
What??
Mr. Garrison
I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this!
Mr. Garrison Sr.
What the hell are you talking about?! I never sexually abused you!
Mr. Garrison
I know! I wanna know why not?!
Mr. Garrison Sr.
WHAT??
Mr. Garrison
Was it that I was ugly?!
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Oh, my God! [turns around]
Mr. Garrison
I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Well, NO!! [walks away, but his son rushes up to grab him]
Mr. Garrison
Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy! [runs off crying. Mr. Garrison Sr. can only express shock.]
The 4 Million Child Blow 2000 lot, next day. Looks like the 4 million kids are assembled
Coordinator
[Onstage] Alright, everyone, quiet please! There are over 4 million of you, so we must have quiet! At this time I would like to introduce the woman who is making this all possible, Yoko Ono! [motions for Yoko to enter]
Yoko Ono
Please [orates 20 seconds of incomprehensible, imitation, Japanese-accented English]... sing song "My Country 'Tis of Thee."
Coordinator
You heard her, We'll start the rehearsal in a few minutes.
Stan
Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
Kyle
Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
Stan
No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
Kyle
Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
Stan
What word could we make up?
Kyle
How about... finkleroy?
Stan
No, uhno, not finkleroy.
Cartman
How about geebo, or, or mung?
Stan
Yeah, mung.
Kyle
Mung's good.
Stan
Sh. Here they come. [the New Yorkers arrive]
Tough Guy 1
Well hel-lo there, queefs. All bundled up nice and warm, are we?
Stan
You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
Tough Guy 2
We're not mung. You're mung.
Kyle
Oh, so you know what mung means, hunh?
Tough Guy 1
Of course we know what mung means!
Athlete
Yeah, D'ya think we wouldn't know what mung means? [Stan laughs, then Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny join in]
Stan
We busted you!
Kyle
Hyeh. Yeah. Mung isn't even a word! We made it up! [they resume laughing]
Tough Guy 1
You guys are even stupider than I thought! Mung is so a word!
Stan
[the boys stop laughing] It is?
New Yorkers
[behind the two toughs and two others] Yeah. [they turn around]
Athlete
It sure is.
New Yorker 1
Yeah.
New Yorker 2
Uh huh. [turns around]
Tough Guy 1
Yeah! Mung is the stuff that comes out when you push down on a pregnant woman's stomach.
Kyle
[winces] Eewww.
Stan
Ooogh.
Tough Guy 1
You guys didn't know that? [the rest of the New Yorkers turn around and they all laugh. Then, the rest of the 4 million+ kids laugh with them] Come on, guys. Let's get away from these rednecks before we get redneckasitis, or somethin'! [they leave. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny turn on Cartman]
Stan
You dumbass, Cartman!
Kyle
Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
The Garrison residence, day. Mrs. Garrison Sr. and her son are sipping coffee on the sofa
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
It's so nice to see you, son. I'm so proud that you're part of the 4 Million Child Recorder Blow.
Mr. Garrison
Yes. I hope it's okay if I stay here a few nights, Mother, I... I have some things I really need to talk to you about.
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
About what?
Mr. Garrison
[set his cup down and sighs] Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
That... that can't be.
Mr. Garrison
He never did, Mom, not once.
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
[stands] That's not true! Your father loved you! Often!
Mr. Garrison
[stands] He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
[cups her ears and shuts her eyes, spilling her coffee] Nohoho! No! If I knew I would have made him do it!
Mr. Garrison
You stood by and let it happen! You saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep!
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
I'm not listening!
Mr. Garrison
Face it, Mother. He never abused me! [his mom starts to cry, and his dad enters the room carrying groceries]
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Uh, what's goin' on?
Mr. Garrison
Mother won't hear the truth!
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
He says you didn't molest him as a child!
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Ah-I didn't! You knew I didn't!
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
No! I didn't know! [cups her ears and shuts her eyes again] I'm not listening!
Mr. Garrison
You can't close your eyes forever, Mother! [she walks away, crying] Mother, wait! [runs after her. Again, Mr. Garrison Sr. is shocked]
The 4 Million Child Blow 2000 lot, later. Kenny G has joined Yoko Ono and the coordinator onstage
Yoko Ono
[Speaks in imitation, harshly thick, Japanese-accented English] Alright people, how many people has a copy. We must have-a practiced the ... song for the performance tomorrow, please.
Coordinator
Okay, children. We need to play closer attention to the sheet music. Remember, if you get lost, just follow along with Mr. Kenny G here.
Cartman
Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Yoko Ono
And-a one gop seven to-sand ... [the children begin to play, and she covers her ears in agony] O-o-o-o. Stop! Stop ... beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere. That was-a terrify! That was-a horri-bee! What we gonna do?!
Kyle
What the hell is that lady talking about?
Stan
I have no idea.
The Garrison gas station. Used to be Garrison and Son, but since Mr. Garrison left, the "Son" has been crossed out. Mr. Mackey walks up to Mr. Garrison Sr., who is changing the oil on a car on blocks
Mr. Mackey
[bends down and looks in] Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.?
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Thuh, that's me.
Mr. Mackey
Uh, my name is Mr. Mackey. I'm your school counselor, m'kay.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
[slides out and rises] What can I do for ya?
Mr. Mackey
Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Uh, brother! Look, I didn't sexually abuse my son when he was younger!
Mr. Mackey
Eh, you didn't?
Mr. Garrison Sr.
No! He's upset because I didn't molest him!
Mr. Mackey
Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
A little, yeah! He thinks if I don't molest him it means I don't love him.
Mr. Mackey
Well, now, uh, what's he supposed to think, Mr. Garrison? I mean, uh, look at all the media, all the magazine ads and television ads talkin' about "sexual molestation", m'kay? He sees all that and assumes you didn't molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
I didn't do it because it's wrong!
Mr. Mackey
I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Hold on a second: are you actually suggesting that I have sex with my 41-year-old son?!
Mr. Mackey
There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, "How far will I go to save my son's life?"
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Well, I won't have sex with him!
Mr. Mackey
Well, I've said all I can say. [walks away, then turns] I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay? [walks away, then turns] Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison. [emphasizes each syllable] Don't lose... your son, m'kay? [walks out of the station]
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Am I the only sane person left on earth?!
The Garrison residence, night. Mr. Garrison Sr. is now seated in his armchair watching television. News item:
Reporter
Tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" on their recorders. [Mr. Garrison walks to the stairs behind his father, but stops to watch the report] It is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history. Yoko Ono has...
Mr. Garrison
Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Good night. [Yoko Ono finishes rambling incoherently]
Reporter
Words to live by.
Mr. Garrison
[pause] Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Uh huh.
Mr. Garrison
[pause] Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
[flatly] Should be fine.
Mr. Garrison
[pause] Uh I'll leave the door open a little in case you ...need to see me about anything.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Won't be necessary.
Mr. Garrison
[steps up, then turns again] I'll just... be going up to bed now. [pause] Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
I'm not going to molest you!
Mr. Garrison
You don't love me! [runs upstairs crying] I wanna die!
Mr. Garrison Sr.
God-damnit! [pounds the arms of the chair with his fists, then rises and goes out the door.]
Roman Holiday Inn, night.
Stan
I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
Kyle
Yeah. They think they're so cool.
Cartman
[rushing into the room with Kenny wearing earmuffs] You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
Kyle
Calm down, Cartman.
Stan
You found what?
Cartman
The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look. [places some earmuffs on Stan's head] There, okay. Let's see here. [places some earmuffs on Kyle and rushes back to his side of the room] Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
Kenny
(Ready.) [Stan and Kyle look at each other and Cartman plays a fat bass note. Kenny farts] (Oh, [farts] shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom! [bawling])
Stan
[incredulous, removes his earmuffs] No way.
Kyle
[removes his earmuffs] I don't believe it!
Cartman
[removes his earmuffs] Um, seriously, you guys! Come on, watch. [leads them outside where a UPS delivery man is offloading packages, and the three put on their earmuffs. He whispers] Okay. [plays that bass note again]
Delivery Man
[farts] Whoa- Oh, my God! [grabs his belly and lets loose a long fart] Aaww, I crapped my pants! [rushes away with a brown stain on the seat of his pants. The boys remove their earmuffs]
Kyle
That's amazing.
Cartman
I told you guys!
Stan
[to Kyle] Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Cartman
That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
Stan
No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
Cartman
Ooooh.
Kyle
Yeah, dude!
Cartman
They should bring back another season of Chicago Hope though, seriously.
Night, the Arkansas Bar. Mr. Garrison Sr. sits by himself at the bar sipping a glass of beer while others around him chatter. A man in blue shirt approaches him
Patron 1
Ey, what's the matter there, Garrison? You look kinda sad.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Well, I'm having some troubles at home.
Patron 1
Well, come on. Tell us about it. We always help each other out, don't we, fellas?
Patron 2
[with mustache] Yeah.
Patron 3
[with goatee] Yeah, that's right.
Patron 1
Yeah.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
All right. It's just that... I mean... We're all family men here, right?
Patron 2
Sure!
Patron 3
Yeah we are!
Blond
[at a table] I am. I know that.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Well, can I ask you guys a difficult question?
Patron 1
Absolutely.
Patron 2
Of course.
Patron 4
Yeah, man.
Patron 5
Come on, Garrison!
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Alright. Would you have sex with your son to save his life? [the others ponder the question]
Patron 2
...Oh, this is one of them Scruples questions, ain't it?
Patron 1
Nono, I got a better one: Would you have sex with your mother... to save your father's life?
Patrons
[wondering] Wooo, yeah.
Patron 2
Oh, like if someone had a gun to your father's head and said, "Have sex with your mother or else I'll shoot him"?
Patron 1
Yeah.
Patron 2
Oh, that's a tough one.
Patron 3
Hmmm.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
No no wait, uh, you don't understand.
Blond
How about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life?
Patrons
No, no, no way. No.
Patron 6
But if it was to save my mother's life, uh-I think I would have to have sex with my father.
Patron 7
Yeup.
Patron 8
Me, too.
Patron 9
Well, I think that goes without saying.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Weh actually, I'm just... talking about a... son.
Patron 8
Well, personally, I would have sex with my son to save to save my mother's life. It depends, uh- how big a gun are we talkin' here?
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Uh, he doesn't have a gun.
Blond
The father doesn't have a gun?
Mr. Garrison Sr.
No! Nobody's got a gun!
Patron 3
I think if someone said, "Have sex with your mother or else I'm gonna kill your son," but he didn't have a gun, I wouldn't do it.
Patron 2
He could have a knife, though.
Patron 1
Yeah.
Patron 3
Sure.
Patron 1
Yeah, a knife.
Bartender
If a killer put a knife to my throat, and said, "Have sex with your father or else I'm gonna kill your mother while having sex with you," ...I would have sex with myself.
Patron 1
...Yeah, I would [Mr. Garrison Sr. gets up and heads out the door]
Patron 2
That's right.
Patron 3
Uh huh.
Bartender
That makes sense.
Patron 10
Mm-hm.
Patron 1
Wasn't that right?
Patron 3
Mm, See?
Roman Holiday Inn, night. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are back in their room reading the sheet music
Stan
How do we write he note, Cartman?
Cartman
Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. [shows it to them on his book]
Stan
Alright. Now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music, and change it to the note Cartman played. [makes the change] Come on. [the boys leave their room again and head for the New York room.] There. [tapes the music to the door. Kyle sticks a small yellow Post-It note saying "Revised Music for Tomorrow" onto the music] That should do it.
Cartman
Sweet. I can't wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody, you guys.
Stan
Okay, let's get back to the room. [the three walk off]
Coordinator
[arrives and sees the change] What's this?? [looks more closely at it] "Revised Music for Tomorrow"?? Chip, did you get revised music for tomorrow??
Chip
What??
Coordinator
Ms. Ono has made revisions again! We've got to get these copied 4 million times and make the revisions to the projected music! Come on! Hurry! [hurries away.]
The Garrison residence, later. Mr. Garrison is asleep in the guest room, which used to be his room. The back door rustles and he wakes up. Footsteps are heard
Mr. Garrison
[sighs, then softly] Dad? [the door opens to reveal his dad's shadow.] Pop, I'm just fast asleep—I'm not hearing anything. [the shadow moves closer and closer...]
The Garrison residence, later. Exterior shot. Energetic motion is heard inside
Mr. Garrison
[ecstatic] Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!
The Garrison residence, morning. Mr. Garrison is at the front door with his luggage
Mr. Garrison
[well-rested and confident] Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon.
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
Are you sure you can't stay one more night, son?
Mr. Garrison
No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
Well, I just hope that NOW we can put the past behind us and, and try to be a normal family again.
Mr. Garrison
We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to.
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
We'll be watching on TV. Make us proud, son.
Mr. Garrison
I will. [hugs each parent] Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad! [turns and heads cheerfully out the door] Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...
Mrs. Garrison Sr.
You did the right thing, Poppa.
Mr. Garrison Sr.
I didn't do squat! [goes inside and opens a door behind which is Kenny G] Here you go, a hundred bucks. [hands Kenny G the money]
Kenny G
Oh, that's okay. Keep your money. Thanks. [walks out and away]
The concert is introduced. Live-action shots throughout
Announcer
Live, from Oklahoma City! [its skyline is shown] Four million third-grade students [a crowd of them is shown] from all over the country [a school bus full of students is shown] playing "My Country 'Tis Of Thee" on their recorders... "MY COUNTRY 'TIS OF THEE" special.
The 4 Million Child Blow 2000 lot, concert day. The 4 million are assembled. Yoko Ono and Kenny G take the stage
Stan
Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
Kyle
We have to watch them! We can't miss it!
Kenny G
Are we all ready to play? [almost whispering] Thanks. Okay. [loudly] Let's see the music! [the music pops up on the stage wall]
Kyle
This is gonna be sweet!
Stan
Oh no, dude. Look! [the projected music is shown] It's the music we changed! [the camera zooms in on the changed note]
Cartman
Uh-oh. [Kenny finally shows up]
Kyle
Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
Yoko Ono
One, two, sign paytah. [Kenny G starts the tune, then the children join in]
Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman
No! [they rush towards the stage. The other kids continue playing]
Stan
Stop! Stop! [he and the other three are near the stage...]
Mr. Mackey
Uh, aren't those our boys?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, no. What are they doing?
Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman
Noooo!!! [some of the kids part for them, but the end of the song arrives.]
The kids play the brown noise, Kenny G and Yoko Ono double over in pain. The camera zooms out for a view of the state of Arkansas, then of North America, as people begin to groan. Shots of Beijing and Paris follow, with their citizens grabbing their asses in pain. A shot of Earth follows, then static. New York City is then shown in flames. An ambulance speeds by as people scream
Reporter
[soberly] Tom, I'm standing in New York City, but it could just as well be any town on Earth right now. The desolation, the damage is exactly the same in every city the whole world over. It's been just under 20 hours since everyone on Earth pooped their pants, and people still roam their damaged homes with disbelief, and loss. Rick?
Rick
[A cleanup crew is shown at work, and the camera pans over to the reporter] Alan, I'm standing at ground zero. Here, the damage is greater than anywhere. [the stage and the lot are bare, except for poop everywhere] Like the rest of the world, everyone here has crapped their pants. Some [Kenny lies dead with rats nibbling on him] crapped themselves to death. And still others ...ruined perfectly good pairs of pants. A nation mourns and tries to rebuild, but the big question that remains is, "How did this happen?" [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk by, whistling]
Kenny G.
Well, I see. Other than making everyone in the world crap their pants, our event went over really well.
Yoko Ono
[Chattering quickly in comical Asian-accented English] Wery well?! Wery well?! You're gonna be on Ricki Lake, I tell you again! Look at ad a bah godda circada she doin wery well?!
Mr. Mackey
[the school buses are ready to take all the third graders back to their homes] Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay? [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come into view and stop]
Kyle
Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
Stan
Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. [Kyle and Cartman grin]
Mr. Mackey
[passing by behind them] Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay. [the boys look afraid to know]
Kyle
Huh?
Tough Guy 1
[stopping by with two others] Here they are!
Tough Guy 2
Yeah!
Stan
[to Kyle] Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
Tough Guy 1
Ey! Not so fast! We know it was you guys that changed the music and made everyone on Earth crap their pants!
Stan
Uuuuh...
Tough Guy 2
Yeah, we knows all about it!
Kyle
Oh, no!
Tough Guy 1
Yeah. Me and the guys, well we was talking, and well, well we just want you to know that we think you're pretty cool.
Kyle
Huh?
Stan
You do?
Tough Guy 1
Sure. I mean, everyone on Earth shit themselves 'cause of you. And that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty amazing!
Tough Guy 2
Yeah, we was wrong about you guys. We're sorry.
Cartman
Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
Tough Guy 1
Yeah. See you guys later. [the three New Yorkers leave]
Mr. Garrison
Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus. [the boys get on and Kenny G stops by] Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G.
Kenny G
Huhuh, good- good-bye. [hugs and kisses him]
Mr. Garrison
M-m-m. [Kenny G releases and walks away] Oh, well, thank you! [steps towards the bus, then stops] You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad. [steps into the bus and faces the driver] Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home.
Ms. Crabtree
Which way should we go?
Mr. Garrison
Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. [Ms. Crabtree starts the bus and drives as day fades into night. It goes over a rise and blinks out of view.]
End of World Wide Recorder Concert

The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000
The Cartman house. Liane is sipping her coffee on the sofa. She lowers it as Cartman screams
Cartman
Mom! MOOOM! Mom! [races down the stairs in pajamas, cap, and coat in the right hand and two dollars in the left one, and stops at Liane's feet] Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
Liane
What is it, snookums?
Cartman
Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars! [shows them off] She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
Liane
Oh my! She must think that you are a very special little muffin.
Cartman
[hops onto the sofa] Yeah! This is so tits!
Liane
Don't say "tits," Eric.
Cartman
Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
Liane
Well, then, now you should take that money and open up a savings account that has compounded daily interest.
Cartman
Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! [dons his coat]
Liane
But Eric, I think maybe the tooth fairy wants you to use that money to learn about saving.
Cartman
Mom, you don't know what the tooth fairy wants me to do with this money, okay? You're not the tooth fairy! I'll see you later! [turns and walks out] Aw, man, this is so tits!
The bus stop. Stan, Kyle and Kenny stand around
Cartman
[off camera, heard running up] Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this! [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at Cartman] Oh my God, you guys, seriously! [runs around them] Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich! [turns to face them] Aren't you stoked?!
Stan
What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
Kyle
He's fat and he's stupid?
Cartman
[pants, then] Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! [presents the two dollars]
Stan
Two dollars!
Kyle
No way!
Stan
For one tooth?
Cartman
For one tooth.
Stan
Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
Kyle
I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
Cartman
Well, that doesn't matter, because I have an idea that is totally tits.
Kyle
...Totally what?
Cartman
Look, I don't know why the tooth fairy's being so cool to me. Maybe she's hot for me. I don't know, but if we all chip in with teeth, then I can hide them under my pillow and we could get enough money to buy a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast.
Stan, Kyle, Kenny
Sega Dreamcast??
Cartman
All we need is teeth.
Stan
I already lost all my baby teeth.
Kyle
Me too. [Kenny says nothing, so the others look at him]
Kenny
[covers his mouth] (Nuh-uh.)
Kyle
You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
Kenny
(No way!)
Cartman
[moves to Kenny's side] Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a [stretches the words] Sega Dreamcast?
Kenny
[punctuates] (No I don't! Thank you.)
Cartman
[ignoring the answer] Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
The school yard. Stan ties Kenny to a tetherball pole. The string leads off to the right
Stan
Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
Kyle
[at the other end, tying the string to a wheelchair] Almost. You ready, Timmy?
Timmy Burch
[the boy in the wheelchair] Timmiihh!
Kyle
When I say "go," you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
Timmy
Timmiihh!
Kyle
Right. You're Timmy.
Timmy
Timmiihh! Lemmeouttaheah!
Kenny
(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
Cartman
I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us. [tugs on Kenny's hood] "Oh, thank you, guys." You're welcome, Kenny.
Kenny
[punctuates] (Fuck you!)
Kyle
Alright! Get ready, Timmy.
Timmy
Timmiihh!
Butters
[walks up] Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?
Stan
What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
Butters
Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. [draws it from his pocket]
Stan, Cartman
You what?
Kenny
(You what?)
Timmy
Timmih-
Butters
Yyep. Oo-one of mine came out not two hours ago.
Stan
Uh, Butters, could we have it?
Butters
Wwell, heck no! Uh you can't have it. Why, I'm gonna stick it under-my pillow and get money from the tooth fairy. She gives me fifty cents a tooth.
Timmy
Ha-a-ugh.
Butters
Well, uh, see ya, fellas. [walks away]
Kyle
[walks up to Stan] Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
Stan
Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Cartman
How are we gonna get it from him?
Stan
I guess we'll have to sneak into his house after he goes to sleep tonight.
Kyle
Yeah, let's go. [the group begins to move when]
Timmy
Go! Timmy go! [revs up, pulling Kenny] Yeah, Timmy! [drives until he runs out of string, then is jerked back]
Kyle
No, Timmy, wait!
Timmy
Engh go uh Timmy! [the string goes taut, and Kenny's face protrudes from his hood]
Kenny
(Hey, guys!) [yanked from his suit into the air] (Heey-ungh) [lands naked in front of Cartman] (Oowww.)
Cartman
Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
Timmy
Hu-aah!
A house, night. Butters is asleep in his room. A pole rises outside with a grinning Cartman dressed as a tooth fairy dangling from it
Cartman
Higher, you guys.
Stan
[struggling with the pole with Kyle and Kenny] Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
Cartman
[bumps into the window] Agh! Careful, you assholes! [opens the window] To the left, you guys, left. [is moved to his left] No, camera left, camera left! [is moved in the other direction, towards Butters' head] That's it, now down. [is lowered, then reaches for the pillow]
Butters
[wakes up] What the-? [rubs his eyes] Who's there? Who is that?!
Cartman
[in falsetto] I am the tooth fairy, my child.
Butters
Hoh. Sorry, Miss Fairy. I didn't mean to gaze at you. I'm back to sleep now, see? [squeezes his eyelids shut]
Cartman
Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. [reaches under and grabs Butters' tooth, then beholds the treasure. He then places some money under the pillow as Butters sneaks a peek.]
Butters
[as Cartman withdraws] Well, oh gosh, I, I didn't think you'd be so fat.
Cartman
Ey!
Kyle
Come on, fatass!
Cartman
Do not open your eyes until morning. [Butters has then shut real tight; Cartman tugs in the rope and is pulled out of the room] Or else I will kick you in the nuts. [drops down] Square in the nuts.
Butters
Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!
Stan
Well?
Cartman
Bull's eye!
Cartman's house, later. He's being tucked in bed
Liane
Tucky tucky time, it's the best time of the night.
Cartman
I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
Liane
No, honey, Mommy's gotta save her throat. I have to work tonight.
Cartman
Okay.
Liane
Good night. [heads for the door. Cartman settles in and is about to place the tooth under the pillow] What do you have there, Eric?
Cartman
Another tooth fell out today; I'm leavin' it for the tooth fairy.
Liane
Oh, my. The tooth fairy will have to give you a big surprise for losing two teeth in two days.
Cartman
I know, huh?
The bus stop, next morning. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are there
Cartman
You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys! [runs around them counterclockwise] Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
Kyle
Did the tooth fairy come?
Cartman
Four dollars. [the other three answer at the same time]
Stan
Oh my God!
Kyle
Four dollars?
Kenny
(Oh, my God!)
Cartman
Do you what this means?
Stan
Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. [he and Kyle grin]
Dentist office, some days later. A phone rings
A Dentist
[answering] Dentist office.
Liane
Oh. Eh-hello, Dr. Roberts? It's Ms. Cartman.
Dr. Roberts
Oh, yes, Ms. Cartman. What can I do for you?
Liane
Well, it's my son. He's lost a lot of his baby teeth, and I was starting to get worried.
Dr. Roberts
Well, losing baby teeth is a natural thing, Ms. Cartman. How many has he lost?
Liane
About a hundred and twelve.
Dr. Roberts
...A hundred and twelve.
Liane
Yes. Fifteen of them in one night. Perhaps he should switch toothpaste?
Dr. Roberts
Your son wouldn't happen to be an "alligator," would he? No? Hm, I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you right now. The American Dental Association convention is this week, but, as soon as I get back, I'll look into it.
Liane
O-oh, thank you. Freebie next week. [hangs up]
Dr. Roberts
What?
Cartman's room, dawn. He rises and throws his pillows off the bed
Cartman
Tih- [the tooth he placed under his pillow is still there] Tooth? [picks it up and looks at it in disbelief] What the hell? Mom!
Liane
[rushes in] Yes, Eric
Cartman
You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
Liane
Oh. Eric, poopie, sit down. [Cartman sits] Mommy has something to tell you. It's just that- well, there is no tooth fairy, Eric. I've been putting all that money under your pillow, and because you got so many teeth fall out, I've actually run out of money and can't go to the grocery store for at least a month.
Cartman
[laughs] You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. "There's no tooth fairy." I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh... [mother and son sit silently for a while] M- Mom?
Liane
I'm sorry, Eric. All children find out sooner or later.
Cartman
Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
Liane
No, honey. It's just-
Cartman
How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
Liane
Oh, Eric, it's just part of being a child.
Cartman
How can I trust you? [hops off the bed] How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself. [tugs at his pajama shirt] Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
Liane
Eric! Eric, wait!
Cartman
[covers his ears] No, Mother! No more lies! [runs out of his room and shuts the door]
The Cartman house. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny wait. Cartman exits and walks down the street upset, ignoring his friends
Stan
[he and the others follow] Dude, where's the money?
Cartman
[flatly] There is no money.
Kyle
No more money??
Stan
What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
Cartman
I know!
Kyle
Cartman, what's going on?!
Cartman
[stops, then faces them sadly] You guys... [turns away] Oh, God, I don't even know how to tell you this.
Stan
Tell us what?!
Cartman
[faces them again] You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. [turns away again]
Kyle
What do you mean, "there's no tooth fairy?"
Cartman
My mom has been giving me the money all this time, and your parents are the ones who left you money.
Stan
Dude.
Kyle
That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
Cartman
But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny. [Kenny approaches him and reaches out, but Cartman bushes him off] Don't touch me, Kenny. [Kenny steps back]
Kyle
[approaches] You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
Cartman
Kyle, open your eyes, man!
Kyle
It's not true! [runs away]
The Broflovski house. Kyle enters the living room. Gerald is on the sofa reading the newspaper
Gerald
[lowers his paper] Oh, hello, son. [Kyle turns to face him]
Kyle
Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
Gerald
What? Oh. Kyle, let's have a little talk. [puts down his paper]
Kyle
[suddenly alarmed] Oh my God! You did lie to me.
Gerald
No. Kyle, she's just make-believe. Like Peter Pan.
Kyle
[looking aghast] Peter Pan, too??
Gerald
Kyle...
Kyle
What about Moses and Abraham?
Gerald
Well, they were probably real.
Kyle
Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
Gerald
Probably not.
Kyle
[frightened] Wahahahah!
Gerald
Look, Kyle, adults make up those things because they're fun for children.
Kyle
Fun for children?! Fun for children?! Look at me, Dad! I don't even know what's real anymore! Weaaaah! [runs out the door]
The town. The boys less Stan sit at a curb moping
Cartman
Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
Kyle
What about Dan Rather? Do you think he's real?
Cartman
No, man, that's just a TV show.
Stan
[rushing up] You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
Cartman
What? That your parents lied to you, too?
Stan
Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
Cartman
How?
Stan
Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
Kyle
All made up. Not real. Nothing's real.
Stan
So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Stan
The kid will never even know.
Cartman
Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
Kyle
Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
Stan
We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
Cartman
Yeah. [leaves with Stan and Kenny]
Kyle
I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
Stan
[returns] Come on, Kyle! [grabs him and pulls him along]
Kyle
What if this is all just somebody's dream?
Cherry Creek, the wealthiest neighborhood in Colorado, night. The bus pulls up to a curb and drops the boys off in front of a three-story mansion
Cartman
Wow, look at the size of these houses!
Stan
Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the [raises his hands to make quotes] "Tooth Fairy."
Cartman
Hey, [points across the street] that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. [the boys head for a rambling ranch house. They skip the front door and head for the back]
Stan
[A window with stickers on it and a bush underneath is shown] There. You can tell this is the kid's window 'cause it's got Mega Man stickers on it. Cartman, once you're in the kid's room, leave the tooth under the pillow, then come back out. We'll wait for the parents to see it and leave money, then swing you back in the house to grab it.
Cartman
Got it. [Stan and the others lift Cartman up.]
Stan
This is the smartest business venture ever. [Cartman is placed into position, but a blond kid swinging from another pole is lifted into position opposite him]
Cartman
What the-? [the camera peels back to show another group of kids on the other side of the bush]
Stan
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
Boy 1
[with somewhat spiky hair] We're gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow, then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him.
Stan
...Hey, you can't do that!
Boy 2
[with cowlick] Why not?!
Stan
Because that's what we're doing!
Cartman
Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
Boy 2
What the hell are you talking about?! We've been doing this for over two years!
Kyle
Two years?
Blond
Nice tooth fairy costume. You think anybody'd believe you in that?!
Cartman
It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
Blond
How dare you! [he and Cartman start fighting in midair]
Boy 1
Look, this is our turf! You'd better scram before the Boss breaks your legs!
Stan
You scram! We were here first!
Rich kid
[having heard the ruckus, opens the window] What's going on? [Cartman and the blond stop and look] Oh! It's the tooth fairies!
Boy 2
Oh, nice going! Now you woke him up! [the blond is lowered]
Stan
You woke him up! [Cartman is lowered]
Rich kid
I don't have any loose teeth, Miss Fairies but I have been a very good boy.
All
Shut up!
Boy 1
Alright, that does it! Come on, we're going to see the Boss!
Stan
Who's the Boss?
Boy 1
Loogie.
Loogie's Ristorante. The light above the door is the one that flickers
Loogie
[enjoying a plate of spaghetti and meatballs, he's dressed for business] My associates here tell me you were working Cherry Creek tonight. Is that true?
Stan
Uuh, yeah.
Boy 1
Right on our turf, Boss! I ain't ever seen that kind of disre- [Loogie raises his right palm] Erp.
Cartman
We were there first!
Loogie
[hops off his chair and walks to the portrait gallery] Kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years. [points to each picture as he traces the line of succession] I do it just like my big brother before me, and my oldest brother before that.
Stan
Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
Loogie
Let me ask you something: You were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kid's pillow? Then what?
Stan
Well, uh-what do you mean?
Loogie
How are the kid's parents gonna know there was a tooth under their child's pillow? [the boys stay silent]
Boy 1
Ha! You guys don't even know how the tooth trade works!
Stan
What's a "tooth trade?"
Loogie
Look, any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress. The tooth racket is much more involved. [a street overlay showing kids at work in the neighborhood appears. A kid dispatcher sends them off] We keep careful track of what houses we've hit so that we don't hit the same one twice in less than two months. [the tooth fairy enters a window with another kid] Inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow, but leave a note for Mom and Dad to see. [this other kid places the note on John's bedroom door: Dear Toothfairy, I lost a tooth! I put it under my pillow!] This is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow. [the fairies ride through the neighborhood on their bikes] Once the note is in place in the last house, we start all over, going back to the first house. But this time, all we have to do is collect money. [shots of the tooth fairies cleaning up] And the kids never know what hit 'em.
The South Park boys
Wow!
Loogie
The hardest part is getting teeth. We tried various places. Cemeteries [Loogie's boys disinter a corpse and pull at its teeth], hockey games [two hockey players collide and one of them smacks the other one. A boy skates out and retrieves the loose tooth], anywhere we can find them [A beat-up boy is tied to a chair in a warehouse. The boy with the spiky hair is about to strike him with a mallet]
Beat-up Boy
Nooo! [the mallet heads for his...]
Loogie
The teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size, color, and quality. [like gems, they are sent to conveyor belts to be sorted by lab technicians] But there's never enough teeth. Never enough.
Stan
Amazing.
Cartman
Man, that is tits!
Loogie
And now my only problem is, what do I do with you? [the boys are alarmed]
Boy 1
Rowwr!
Loogie
Tell you what: how would you like to run the South Park tooth racket for me?
Stan
Oh. Uh-I don't know.
Loogie
It's that, or else I can cut off your penises. [motions with his knife]
Cartman
Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
Kyle
Cartman!
Stan
How much do we get if we work for you?
Loogie
I'll cut you in at 2%.
Cartman
Two percent, have my penis cut off. [Kyle gets mad at him] Two percent-
Stan
We're in!
American Dental Association, a gleaming skyscraper, day. Then the interior is shown, with all the dentists assembled. Dr. Roberts speaks
Dr. Roberts
Fellow dentists: As you all know, we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country. There are also reports of missing tooth fairy money. We believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this. [presses a button to reveal a projection] A giant half-chicken/half-squirrel [shown sitting on a tree stump] that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest [the chicken-squirrel feeds its young] for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring! We believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra [the chicken-squirrel tries to solve a basic problem], and that it-
Dentist
[stands] Uh, excuse me? I think I have a more logical theory.
Dr. Roberts
...Yeah. Weh well, by all means, Mr. Foley, enlighten us!
Mr. Foley
I think what we've got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket. Something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit. [the rest of the doctors, including the ADA head, laugh at him]
Dr. Roberts
Oh, Mr. Foley, you realize how ridiculous that sounds.
Mr. Foley
It's not ridiculous. It's very possible. I've seen it happen before.
Dr. Roberts
Where?!
Mr. Foley
In Montreal. [the rest of the convention laughs louder]
Dr. Roberts
And where, pray, is this "Montreal"?!
Mr. Foley
[determined] Look, I know how to handle this. All we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall. You'll see! I'll have it taken care of in a matter of weeks!
Dr. Roberts
Uhyub-dub very well, Mr. Foley, you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile, we'll deal with the real problems at hand. [points at the chicken-squirrel]
Mr. Foley
Well, I will! [leaves his seat and heads out the door]
Dr. Roberts
[chuckles] Anyway, the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall. His large beak is probably detachable, and works as a flotation device.
South Park Elementary, day. Lunchtime in the cafeteria
Boy
[off-camera] Here! Here, over here, look! Look what I got- I got from the chef! [the main cafeteria doors fly open and in walk the foursome. Kenny is dressed in a baby-blue suit with hat and cane, Cartman wears a floor-length tiger-fur coat, Stan wears a formal blue suit, and Kyle wears a book- reads a book and wears a black suit. As they walk through the cafeteria kids turn and stare. Among them are Bebe, Butters, and Wendy. The boys enter the kitchen]
Chef
Hello there, children.
The Boys
Hey, Chef.
Stan
We all want double-desserts today!
Chef
Oh. Well, uh, I'm afraid that the school charges extra for that.
Cartman
Yeah? Well, that ain't nothin' but a thang. [tosses Chef a wad of bills]
Chef
[surprised, fumbles with the wad] Oh my God! There has got to be at least fifteen dollars here!
Cartman
That's right. Keep the change, my man.
Chef
Well! Look at you cute little crackers! With your money and your fancy clothes and your cell phones, it's almost like you were- [realizes where this is headed] Oh my God, children! What have I told you about drugs?!
The Boys
That there's a time and a place for everything, and it's called "college."
Chef
That's right. And the only thing worse than doin' drugs is dealin' drugs! I'm gonna tell you about when I was your age and got offered drugs. [A flashback to Chef's 8th year. He's walking down the street with his little girlfriend, a Hawaiian wearing a flower in her hair]
Little Chef
Ooo, come on, now.
Kid 1
[all in blue] Hey, kid. You wanna try some dope?
Girl
What?
Kid 1
Come on, kid. Don't you wanna get high?
Little Chef
Hey, man, I don't need dope. Let me sing you a little song:
I can't wait until I grow up
and my weenie get big and strong
'Cause when it does I'm gonna bust
And make love to you Amanda all night long
I'm gonna make love to y'Amanda in about ten years!

Kid 3
[olive complexion] What?
Kid 2
[with the A shirt] What the hell is he talking about?
Little Chef
[to Amanda, who's surprised] And that toothpick is gonna turn into an oak tree,...

Stan
U-uh, Chef.
Little Chef
I'ma knock ya down, knock ya up,...

Stan
Chef!
Little Chef
...knock ya over, an' knock ya all around.

Stan
CHEF!
Chef
Uh?
Stan
We're not dealing drugs!
Chef
You're not?
Stan
No!
Chef
Oh, uh weh-ell, children, whatever you're doin', just remember this: havin' money may seem fun, but... [tries to find a moral] Ooh, uh-oh, never mind.
The Boys
Thanks, Chef. [they leave]
Kyle
See ya.
Chef
Damn, that little Amanda was fine! I'm gonna look her up. [reaches under the counter for a phone and dials away]
The boys return to the cafeteria with their food
Stan
Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
Cartman
Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
Stan
We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
Cartman
Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
Kyle
[still reading] Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
Cartman
Sure, Kyle.
Loogie's restaurant, night. Loogie's talking to someone on his cell phone at table
Loogie
They're what?! They're not gonna pay me? Who the hell do they think they are? I want those South Park kids dead! I want their families dead! I want their houses burned to the ground! [Mr. Foley enters; Loogie hangs up and does a falsetto] Oh, hi there, Mister. My mommy and daddy are out front, if you need 'em.
Mr. Foley
Let's cut the crap, kid. My name is Tom Foley. I'm with the American Dental Association.
Loogie
Sit down, Mr. Foley. Do you want some spaghetti?
Mr. Foley
[sits] No thanks, I just brushed. I just wanted to let you know that I'm onto you.
Loogie
I told the ADA a thousand times: I know nothing about teeth. I'm just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles.
Mr. Foley
I am going to find out who the boss is! And when I do I'm gonna bust his ass and everyone's ass who helped hide his ass! [having run out of things to say, he turns and walks out. Loogie resumes eating]
Cartman's house, day, living room. He is seated behind a desk talking to a boy
Cartman
So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
Odd Boy
[an anxious kid with oval head and big eyes] That's right, yeah [plops the bag on the desk] . It's all top-grade stuff, too.These Chinese kids are selling their teeth for peanuts, see?
Cartman
[takes a scope out and analyzes a tooth] How much?
Odd Boy
Well, huh, Tang Li wants 30, but, but I can cut you a deal for 28, yeh ha, buh. Heh, ha-buh, what do you say, huh? [smiles]
Cartman
Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
Weasel
[the odd boy] Awuh, hawuh, why, sure, sure.
Cartman
[rests his scope] Do you think I'm an idiot?
Weasel
Huh?
Cartman
These are cat teeth, you sonofabitch! You trying to sell me 400 lbs. of cat teeth?! [Weasel starts acting like a monkey. Kyle is seen reading another book] Get out of my sight! [Weasel hops off the chair and splits] Lousy little scum! [the phone rings] What?!
Boy 2
[on the phone. His mates have Kenny on a bridge railing, ready to dump him] This is your last chance, kid! Either you give the boss his cut, or else we're gonna throw your pal into the river wearing concrete galoshes!
Cartman
I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! [hangs up]
Kyle
Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
The river. Boy 2 hangs up
Boy 2
He's not gonna do it?!
Kenny
(He's not gonna do it?!) [looks over as Boy 2 places a call]
Boy 2
He's not gonna do it, boss!
Loogie
Well then, throw him in. [Boy 2 gives the signal]
Boy 1
Alright, kid. Time to die. [he and his partner each grab a hold of an arm]
Kenny
(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!) [the two boys shove him off. Kenny lands in the river, but hits bottom before even getting wet. He looks down and attempts a few steps. The others look down from the bridge.]
Boy 2
Oh, man, how deep is the Platte River?
News report, night
Anchor
...to which Ms. Clinton replied, "I don't even like Vagina." Finally tonight, a human-interest story. Dan Akawa is live.
Dan Akawa
[field reporter, next to a family] Thanks, Tom. I'm here at the house of little Billy Circlovich, um. Billy is in desperate need of a bone-marrow transplant [Billy strokes his nose] or he will most certainly die. [addresses the boy] Billy, how much more money do you need for the transplant? [puts the mic in front of Billy]
Billy
[almost whispering] Sih, six hundred dollar-. [the reporter jerks the mic away]
Dan Akawa
Louder, Billy, we can't hear ya!
Billy
[trembling] Duh six hundred dohollars.
Dan Akawa
Well, that's a lot of money.How the hell are you gonna get all that in the short amount of time you have left?
Billy
Well, I a-I don't know.
Dan Akawa
Well, Billy, I also understand that you lost a tooth today.
Billy
Yehahah.
Dan Akawa
Billy, we want you to put that tooth under your pillow tonight, because we have a feeling that the tooth fairy [points to Billy's parents and winks at the camera] is going to leave you six hundred dollars for it!
Billy
Really?
Mr. Circlovich
Really?
Dan Akawa
Yes, really. [hands Dad the money; he passes it to Mom. Billy grins] Six hundred dollars. I might also mention that Billy lives in Crestview Apartments, just off Arapaho Road on Emporia Street. Back to you, Tom. [print!] How was that?
Mr. Foley
[standing with two other dentists and the field crew] Perfect. The trap is set.
Cameraman
Naw, come on. D'ya really think anyone will fall for somethin' that stupid?
The Cartman house. Cartman is in a hot tub, Stan and Kyle sit nearby
Cartman
Six hundred dollars, you guys! Come on, get your stuff together! [leaves the tub] This is gonna be tits!
Kyle
[to Stan] Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
Cartman
[returns] Will somebody take those books away from him?
The Circlovich house, night. A Rotary Phone Service van sits out front. Switch to Billy's room. Dad hides the $600 behind his back while Mom talks to Billy
Mrs, Circlovich
Be sure to put your loose tooth under your pillow, Billy.
Billy
Okay-y, Mom. [turns and hops on the bed. Outside, a periscope rises from the van roof and looks around]
Mr. Foley
[in the van, moves the viewer aside] Thank you for helping out, gentlemen. [walks up to the other dentists and a technician] If this sting operation works, some bogus tooth fairies should be showing up to take the sick kid's money. When they touch the kid's pillow, an alarm will sound, and that's when you hit the button, Murphy, and activate the lights. Everybody got it?
Dentists
Got it.
Murphy
[the technician, acting dumb] Duuuh, which button do I hit again, boss? [Foley isn't laughing, so Murphy chuckles] Just kidding. You know how there's always the dumb guy in sting operations in the movies? I was, you know I was actin', I was actin' like him, eheh, oh.
The highway, night. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle walk along a path paralleling the highway. Cartman is dressed as the tooth fairy.
Cartman
Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
Kyle
I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
Stan
Dude, just stop thinking about it.
Kyle
But I can't, because, what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together? [the boys pass the Platter River]
Kenny
[still in the river in the distance] (You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)
Kyle
Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down, [(Heeyy!!)] and my own existence fading.
The Circlovich house, the van.
Billy
[heard in the van] G'night, Mom. G'night, Dad.
Mr. Foley
Alright. Everyone, keep your eyes peeled. [everyone suits up in riot gear. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle arrive at Billy's bedroom. Cartman is quickly hoisted up as Billy's parents come to kiss him]
Billy
I'm going to bed now, Mommy. I put my tooth under the pillow. Do you really think the tooth fairy will give me money for the transplant?
Mr. Circlovich
I think so, Billy. I think so.
Billy
Well, I can't wait to feel healthy and strong again.
Cartman
[thinking aloud] Yeah, well, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer, Billy, 'cause that 600 bucks is mine!
Kyle
Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave. [Cartman opens the window and floats in grinning] Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! [begins to disappear]
Stan
[noticing the silence] Kyle?
Murphy
Eh something strange is happening with the computers. [Stan looks at the space in which Kyle once stood]
Loogie
[shows up with his mob] Well, well, well. What do we have here?
Stan
[notices] Aw, shit.
Loogie
Did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever? Kolovski [Boy 1 steps forward], put this buttwipe out of his misery. [Kolovski reaches into his jacket]
Cartman
[retrieves the cash] I got it!
Billy
[opens his eyes and rises] The tooth fairy! [the alarms go off.]
Mr. Foley
Let's move out! [exits the van with the other dentists]
Loogie
Aw, drat! [the dentists close in]
Mr. Foley
Give it up, kids. You're surrounded by dentists.
Loogie
It was a trap!
Mr. Foley
That's right. And now it's all exposed! You're through! The only thing left to do is to haul all you kids down to prison! [the other dentists move in closer]
A voice
This is reality! I am everywhere [Kyle's head, undulating, appears], and nowhere.
Mr. Foley
What the hell?
Cartman
Kyle?
Kyle
I am nothing, and everything.
Everything and everyone begin to undulate with Kyle's head and scream and groan. Next, Kyle's fetus (with hat) is seen floating against a starry sky. Then, his head flies over a desert, and images from his past clock in: a deer, a skip-loader, a mailbox, a slice of Swiss cheese. Back at Billy's house, the images are: Kyle's head, a boombox, Kyle's head, a frog, Kyle's head, a cow, Kyle's head, a tricycle, Kyle's head, a four-assed monkey, Kyle's head. The half-chicken/half-squirrel shows up as Kyle's head disappears for the last time, and scares everyone
Dr. Roberts
Well, I told you! [the chicken-squirrel goes after the dentists, and the kids disperse]
Mr. Foley
Let's get outta here! [leaves with his group. Everyone scatters. Stan, Cartman, and Loogie remain in the backyard, and Billy grins with the $600 back in his hands. Kyle reappears in front of them]
Kyle
Hunh. That was pretty weird.
Loogie
Jesus! The little sick kid was a setup all along! [Billy drops from his bed and walks away] How could I be so stupid?!
Stan
What?
Loogie
I can't believe I fell for such an obvious trap! What the hell is wrong with me?!
Cartman
Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
Loogie
Oh well. Maybe it's good my empire has fallen.
Stan
Really?
Loogie
Yeah. I kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways.
Stan
So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
Loogie
Naah. In a way, I'm just glad the whole thing's over with.
Kyle
Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
Cartman
...Tits.
The Platte River, day. Kenny has turned to his left. As the end credits roll, Kenny tries with great effort to make his way to a bank. He hops a few times and lands in a hidden gully in which he promptly drowns. A motorized chair is soon heard
Timmy
[zipping by on the road above] Timmy!
End of The Tooth Fairy Tats 2000

Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000
South Park Elementary, Monday during the day. The kids are out on the playground. The camera pans to the right, showing kids on the hobby elephants, the swings, and the jungle gym. It rests on Butters holding a starting flag.
Butters
Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
Sledder
[three teams of four boys apiece] Ready!
Butters
On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! [the teams head down the small hill, and Cartman's team finishes first]
Stan
We win again! [all get off their sleds]
Token
That's not fair! Cartman's ass is so fat he makes your sled go faster!
Cartman
Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!
Lizzy
We want to use the sleds now, butt pirates!
Stan
Sleds are for guys.
Cartman
Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
Lizzy
These are the school's sleds, ass rammers, not yours!
Stan
Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
The rest of the boys
Yeah!
Lizzy
I bet we can sled ten times better than you, doughnut punchers!
Kyle
Oh yeah?!
The Girls
Yeah!
Cartman
We'd kick your girlie ass in sledding!
Lizzy
How about a race down a real hill, then?!
The Girls
Yeah!
Stan
You got it!
The rest of the boys
Yeah!
A few others
Yeah!
Lizzy
Your best four sledders against our best four sledders!
Stan
Noo problem!
Lizzy
Then we'll see you this Saturday on Phil Collins Hill!
Kyle
Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
Lizzy
See you there! And may the best woman win, turd burglars!
Stan
Oh, boy! We'll show them!
Butters
Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
Clyde
Yeah. Those girls don't realize what good sledders Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are.
Token
Yeah! And with Cartman's enormously fat ass, the boys are sure to win!
Cartman
Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time [walks to a rock and picks it up] I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! [Kyle draws near to Token]
Kyle
Fatass.
Cartman
There! [chucks the rock and it knocks Token down]
Token
Oh! [falls face first into the snow. Kyle is stunned that Cartman followed through]
Cartman
[sees what he's done] Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
Mr. Mackey's office, some time later. Eric and Token are seated inside. Token's right arm is in a sling and his right eye is blackened
Mr. Mackey
And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?
Liane
Eric, don't you realize you could've seriously injured your little friend?
Cartman
[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Mom.
Liane
Don't apologize to us, apologize to him!
Cartman
[dragging the words] I'm sorry, Token.
Mr. Mackey
Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad, Eric.
Cartman
Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking? [drops from his chair] The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day. [turns and heads for the door] See ya later.
Mr. Mackey
[raises his index finger] Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!
Cartman
No way!
Mr. Mackey
Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- [the door opens and two suits enter]
Man 1
Counselor Mackey?
Mr. Mackey
Yes?
Man 1
I'm Agent Sharp and this is Agent Keen. We're with [with gravity] the FBI.
Agent Keen
We're here to investigate the rock-throwing incident.
Mr. Mackey
Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention.
Agent Sharp
I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. School Counselor. You see, since the victim in this case is African-American, this is considered [close-up] a hate crime.
Cartman
...What the hell is a hate crime?
Mr. Mackey
Uh, oh, but I don't think this is a ruh-
Agent Keen
New laws have been passed that make any crime based on race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation a federal offense.
Cartman
What? A federal offense?
Mr. Mackey
Oh no.
Cartman
Oh no??
Agent Keen
We're sorry, Ms. Cartman, but we must follow protocol. [grabs a hold of Cartman] Your son will be taken into custody and then tried in a federal court of law. [the two agents walk out with Cartman]
Liane
Oh my goodness.
Trial TV, Tuesday. The letters fly into place over blind Justice holding the scales
Announcer
The hate crime trial of the century is underway [Cartman is shown] on Court TV tracks U van. [Token is shown]. Live. Here's your host, Leslie Smith.
Leslie
What turns a normal, fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious, hate-crime-committing racist? We take you live to the courtroom [the courthouse is shown] as the defendant takes the stand.
The courtroom. The prosecutor grills Cartman
Prosecutor
Mr. Cartman, do you know a boy by the name of "Token?"
Cartman
Uh, yes?
Prosecutor
Who is Token?
Cartman
He's a black kid that goes to my school?
Prosecutor
Black! [gets animated] Did you say black?! You called him black?!
Cartman
He is black.
Prosecutor
O! He said it again! [the audience gasps] He is African-American, and so you decided to pick him out!
Cartman
I did?
Prosecutor
The rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate African-Americans!!
Cartman
No! I hate hippies!
Prosecutor
What?!
Cartman
I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about "protectin' the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
Liane
[behind the defense area] Oo, poopiekins?
Prosecutor
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is why we have hate-crime laws! This "monster" committed a crime—not against an individual, but against a race! Do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison!
Cartman
[off camera] Ey! Don't call me fat, asshole!
Prosecutor
[faces the audience and judge] The prosecution rests.
Lizzy
[walks in with Bebe, stops next to Stan and Kyle] Don't forget: we still have a sledding race this Saturday, pillow biters. [turns around and walks away]
Stan, Kyle
We know!
Stan
Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
The courtroom, some time later. A verdict has been reached, and the Judge announces it.
Judge
Eric Cartman, you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime. For this, I hereby sentence you to the Alamosa Juvenile Hall, until you turn twenty-one.
Cartman
No!
Judge
I am making an example of you, to send a message out to people everywhere: that if you want to hurt another human being, you'd better make damn sure they're the same color as you are! [Cartman stares blankly back at the Judge, Stan and Kyle look at each other] Court is adjourned! [gavels one last time.]
The Girls
[Bebe, Lizzy, and Red jump for joy.] Woohoo! Hooray!
Judge
Bailiffs, escort this little bastard to Juvenile Hall.
Black Bailiff
Yes, sir. [they turn to face Cartman]
White Bailiff
Alright, you! ...Uh-uh-uh, where'd he go? [Cartman has disappeared, leaving a fallen chair behind]
Kenny's house. Cartman rushes up to it and pounds on the front door. Kenny opens the door
Cartman
[jumping excitedly] Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
Kenny
(What the fuck for?!)
Cartman
They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
Kenny
(Mexico?! Why the heck do I have to take you all the way to Mexico?!)
Cartman
[slaps Kenny] Calm down, Kenny!
Kenny
(Hey!)
Cartman
Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
Kenny
(Yes)
Cartman
Well, come on! I don't have much time! [heads for the garage. Outside, the garage door opens and a tiny truck creaks out with Kenny at the wheel and Cartman in the back seat]
News Flash: "High Speed Chase"
Anchor
A car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of South Park! Hate-crime suspect Eric Cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friend's Go-Go Action Bronco! Our Eye in the Sky Greg Nimins is there live. Greg?
Greg Nimins
["NEWS 4 LIVE!"] Tom, it looks like the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading east on 285. Police officers are right behind him [in a single line, creeping] but as with any chase, they're keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway. [Kenny takes a transition road off to his right] Tom, it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285. He's going into a residential neighborhood now; this is where it could get dangerous, as there are pedestrians about.
In the Go-Go Action Bronco
Cartman
Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
Kenny
[looks back] (Why don'tcha keep your head down?!) [Cartman ducks]
back to the report
Greg Nimins
Tom, the police have set a roadblock right where the Go-Go Action Bronco is heading. [they have also enlisted the fire department's help] This could be the final stand-off.
Policeman 1
[holds his hand up for a halt] Alright, that's far enough. Stop the Go-Go Action Bronco and come out with your hands up. [the Bronco keeps going] Just bring it to a stop and come on out. [the Bronco keeps going] Jeezus, he's gonna ram it! [the officers dive for cover and Kenny pushes into the two cars blocking his way. Slowly, tons of steel give way before the puny Bronco, and Kenny and Cartman break through the blockade. The Bronco leaves and the officers get up.] Crazy son of a bitch.
News Flash: Continuing coverage. Stan and Kyle watch the news flash at Stan's house
Greg Nimins
Well, it's been over thirteen hours now, and still the car chase has not ended. [eight cars are shown in four rows of two following the little Go-Go Action Bronco.]
Kyle
What the hell are they doing?
Greg Nimins
The chase has now moved through most of Arizona and nears the Mexican border.
Stan
Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
Kyle
Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. [the camera zooms out to show two lines of police cars following closely behind Kenny and Cartman. At least 22 cars are shown]
The Arizona desert
Cartman:
We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico! [the little Bronco crawls to a dead stop.] Oh, God dammit! [the police cars rush in and the first one bumps the Bronco down the road. The others run into the first one and pile on. A few cars fly over and crash]
Stan's house. The phone rings
Stan
[answers] Hello?
Lizzy
Just a friendly reminder: Cartman's going to jail and you've got four days until the race, rump rangers!
Stan
Son of a bitch!
A truck arrives at the main gates of a prison in the desert. The gates part and the truck enters
Driver
Here we are, the end of the road. Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall.
A clown face greets the truck and the double doors open. Officers line up and Cartman gets a good look at the inmates. Two kids are using weights, a third sits brooding, an angry African-American boy stands next to another brooding kid. Four kids play basketball, with the blond one having blood in his hair. Two kids play tic-tac-toe, and two others play tetherball. Cartman looks again and sees a sign saying, "Gruffy Bear sez: Try to escape and we'll shoot you where you stand." Two soldiers pace the catwalk above. Cartman looks again, and three boys beat a fourth over a football. A kid in nothing but briefs puts on airs while smoking. Cartman looks again and three babies play with blocks under an officer's semiautomatic. The babies are chained to each other
A few moments later, and Cartman is in an orange prison suit being admitted
Warden
Prisoner 24601, arriving. [Cartman enters holding some bedding] Forward, prisoner! You will wake up each morning at 0500. [leads him in] Lockdown is until 0900. At ten we begin random searches and checks for contraband. [they pass through a security door into the mess hall] At 11:30 we have naptime, followed by finger-painting. Your cellmate is Romper Stomper! [the other kids look up and gasp]
Cartman
Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
Romper Stomper
[steps into the aisle] I am! [His feet are shown with yellow pails underneath them. Cartman turns, and a menacing kid with a teardrop tattoo under the left eye looks back at him] And I don't want no new cellmate!
Warden
[Cartman hides behind him] You don't have a choice, Stomper! Now, show this new prisoner the ropes!
Romper Stomper
Oh, I will! [steps forward on his pails] You bet your ass I will.
Wednesday, Phil Collins Hill, practice run. Elevation: 9436 feet. The boys in the class are gathered at the summit with Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. Phil Collins' face is the hill's defining geographic feature
Stan
Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
Kyle
Yeah. Cartman's weight was what gave us speed, so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides Cartman. [The others look around at each other]
Stan
Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
Butters
...Uuhh, I think Clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid.
Clyde
Huh?
Kyle
Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.
Clyde
I'm not fat.
Stan
Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
Kyle
Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
Clyde
[sits on the back end of the sled] Hey, I'm not fat, you guys. I'm just kind of big-boned.
Stan
Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! [he, Kyle, and Kenny push off and then hop on as the sled picks up speed. The rest of the kids cheer them on]
Kyle
[as the sled stops] Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
Lizzy
[her team's sled passes the boys by] See you Saturday, poo sniffers!
Stan
[looks back at Clyde] Nice going, fat boy!
Alamosa Juvenile Hall. Some of the kids gather around Cartman.
Romper Stomper
Well, well, well. New fish. How about you come up with a reason why we don't break your arms?!
Inmates
Yeah!
Cartman
Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
Romper Stomper
Oh yeah? The way I see it, there's two kinds of kids in the world: kids who like Animaniacs, and kids who don't like Animaniacs. You're either with us, or you're against us. So which are you?!
Cartman
Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?
Romper Stomper
[after some thought] ...Neither do we
Cartman
[softly] Oh, thank you, Jesus. [normally] So we're friends now?
Romper Stomper
No! There's no friends in the Big House! You come in with nobody and you leave with nobody. We don't believe in "friends."
Inmates
Yeah!
Cartman
Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.
Romper Stomper
Now, go find me some cigarettes and I'll tell you how to bust out of here.
Phil Collins Hill, second practice run. Kyle and Kenny add the finishing touches to something on the sled
Stan
Okay, we've figured it out. To add more weight to the sled, we're gonna use these bricks [points to them], but we're gonna cover 'em with kid's clothes so that the girls think it's another kid!
Pip
Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
Clyde
So I don't get to be on the team now?
All the boys
Shut up, fatass!
Kyle
Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! [Clyde glares back]
Stan
Come on, let's get it a try. [he and Kyle get on, and Kenny starts the sled and gets on,]
Kenny, Stan
Woopee!
Stan
Yeah-
Stan, Kenny, Kyle
Wo-o-o-o-oh! [they lose control of the sled and start spinning]
Stan
[to Kyle] Dude, bail! Bail! [they jump off, leaving Kenny with the brick rider. They end up face down]
Kenny
(Huh? Uh.) [the sled hits a rock, tossing him through the air] (AAAAAA!) [slams into a tree and sticks] (Ufff!) [the brick rider slams into him, killing him] (Ugh!)
Stan
[looks up] Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.
Kyle
We killed Kenny?
Stan
We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. [they walk up to the tree and stand in front of the puddle of blood]
Kyle
Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
Stan
Nothing else is gonna work. [the rest of the boys converge on the tree] We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
Butters
Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
Pip
This is a sad day for men everywhere.
Stan
You know something, guys? I think we all took Cartman's ass for granted.
All the boys
Yeup.
Kyle
If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
Butters
Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
Lizzy
[arrives and steps off the sled] Woohoo. Great time, girls. [notices Kenny flattened against the tree] Oh, gee. Looks like you lost another sledder. Good luck on Saturday, doughnut punchers! [walks away with her sled and the three other girls]
Stan
That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
Some boys
Oh?
Other boys
[simultaneous] Huh?
Kyle
How?
Stan
I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
Kyle
Sweet! Let's go!
The group
Hooray! Alright! Here we go!
Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Thursday. Visiting hours 10:00 to 2:00. Relatives have come to visit the inmates
Mother 1
And have you been brushing your teeth?
Boy 1
Yes, Mommy.
Mother 1
And not dropping your soap?
Boy 1
Yes, Mommy.
Boy 2
Hi, Mom.
Mother 2
Young man, that is the fourth time you've been late for our visiting time; you are grounded.
Boy 2
Grounded? On, no! Um, wait... [Cartman has no visitors yet]
Guard
[leads Kyle and Stan to Cartman] Here you go, boys. Keep it short.
Cartman
Hey you guys.
Kyle
[he and Stan take their seats] Hey, fatass. How's prison?
Cartman
Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?
Stan
Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
Kyle
Yeah! So you gotta bust out of here. [lowers his voice] So we made you this cake. [lifts it onto the counter, and it reads, "Get Out Soon, Cartman"] There's a ailnay ilefay inside of it.
Cartman
A what?
Kyle
[softly] An ailnay ilefay.
Cartman
Wwhat's that?
Kyle
Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
Stan
Yeah, you stupid umbassday!
Cartman
I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here
Kyle
They on'tday?! [takes the cake down] Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
Stan
...Yeah.
Cartman
[a guard walks past him] Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
Kyle
Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
Cartman
Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
Stan
Sshh! [the guard looks over]
Cartman
Look, if you guys want me back to win the sledding race, [hushed] then I need those cigarettes.
Stan
How are we supposed to give them to you?
Cartman
Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
Stan
But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
Cartman
I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass. [Stan and Kyle look at him and bust out laughing] Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!
Stan
Alright, here. [pulls some out and slips them through the holes one by one. The guard checks his watch and Cartman packs his ass]
Cartman
Well, okay... here... l'see...
Stan
Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
Kyle
Me too.
Cartman
Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. [leaves the visiting area]
Kyle
Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. [he and Stan laugh]
Cartman
[at the door] Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. [the guard opens the door and Cartman walks in]
Alamosa Juvenile Hall, outside the main gate. Stan and Kyle exit and Stan sets the cake on the ground.
Stan
That sucks that we couldn't give him the nail file. [pulls it out]
Kyle
So now what do we do?
Stan
There's only one thing we can do. We have to go see Token and see if he'll forgive Cartman for hate-criming him. Come on, we're running out of time!
Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Cartman's cell. He enters
Romper Stomper
[reading a book, looks up] Well, did you get the cigarettes?
Cartman
Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
Romper Stomper
Alright. Go sit on the toilet and poop them out. I'll keep an eye out for the guards. [Cartman does as told and starts groaning]
Cartman
Engh. Egh. Uuuh, stupid cigarettes. [groans some more until a plop is heard] One. [groans and screams until a second plop is heard] Heh, two. [more groans] Come on! Uugh, come on, now! Come on, uuhhhgghh [plop] yeahhh. Hoh. Phew. [flushes the toilet and Romper looks up horrified] Hoh. ...Oh, God-damnit! [walks back to Romper crestfallen]
Romper Stomper
You flushed them?!
Cartman
Well, you spend eight years takin' a crap and then flushin' the toilet; it sorta becomes a reflex! Please, just help me bust out of here.
Romper Stomper
No way, douche. I told you: I ain't your friend. If you want me to help you, you're gonna have to sneak something else in for me.
Cartman
Son of a bitch!
South Park, Friday during the day. Stan and Kyle get off a bus onto an affluent part of town
Kyle
Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
Stan
Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
Kyle
Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
Stan
Yeah. [they walk up to the front door of a nice house. Kyle rings the bell]
Linda Black
[answering] Hello?
Stan
Hi. Can Token come out and play?
Linda Black
Well, his head is still a little sore, but you can come in, if you like. [the boys enter]
Kyle
Killer.
Stan
[sees Token] Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
Token
No.
Kyle
Well then, [Token begins to move away. Kyle holds his shoulder, but moves with him. Stan follows] you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
Token
Yeah.
Steve Black
I'm afraid it's not that simple, boys.
Stan
It's not?
Steve Black
No. You see, the only person that can let Eric out of Juvenile Hall is the governor.
Kyle
Dammit! Son of a bitch, dammit! [remembers where he is] Oh, sorry.
Steve Black
No, I'd, actually agree with you.
Kyle
Huh?
Steve Black
Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I'd love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind.
Stan
Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
Steve Black
Oh, he wouldn't listen to me.
Kyle
Why not?
Steve Black
Because I'm black.
Stan, Kyle
Oh.
Steve Black
Sit down, boys. I'm gonna give you a little lesson about hate-crime laws. [leads them away]
Alamosa Juvenile Hall. Cartman is at the toilet pooping something else. Romper is reading
Cartman
[moans and tries until a small splash is heard] Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh. [walks in with a box and tosses it on the ground] Here you go, God-damnit!
Romper Stomper
[tosses his book away and stands up] Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. [picks it up] Ew, it smells, man.
Cartman
Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!
Romper Stomper
You're not gonna break out of here! You're here 'til you're 21, douche!
Cartman
But you said-
Romper Stomper
I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?
Cartman
I thought that-
Romper Stomper
Hneah. You'd better wise up to the way things work in the big house. [walks to the cell door] Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw [Cartman, forsaken, begins to cry] Yeah, it's a little ripe, but it's brand new, man! You can play it at recess. [turns to Cartman] Hey. Uh, what are you doing? [Cartman cries some more] You... you can't cry in prison, man. They'll bust your head open. What's the matter with you?!
Cartman
I want my Mo-omm [cries some more and rubs his eyes]
Romper Stomper
Dude. [walks up to Cartman]
Cartman
Mommy, I want my Mommy! [continues crying]
Romper Stomper
Look, if it's that important to you, I'll bust you out of here.
Cartman
You will?
Romper Stomper
Yeah. ...Yyeah, I will. Uh-but not because you're my friend. Only because... because I wanna bust out, too. Anh-anh, and see Disneyland.
The governor's office, day. An aide peeks in
Aide
Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?
Governor
Naw, not another committee. Send them in. [Stan, Kyle, and Token enter. Kyle carries a boombox and Token an easel with their presentation on it. They set up] This is the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee?
Token
Yeah.
Governor
Well, boys, what can I do for you?
Stan
[to Kyle] Okay, go ahead and start.
Kyle
I don't start, you start.
Stan
Oh, uhyeah. [walks to the easel and clears his throat] Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." [shows the title page. Kyle presses the play button for some ambiance] Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
Token
[flips a page to depict a stabbing in progress] If somebody kills somebody, it's a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it's a hate crime.
Kyle
And we think that that is [flips the page to reveal a copy of the title page] a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
Stan
[flips the page to reveal a person tagging City Hall] If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
Token
[flips the page to reveal a man being hit deliberately by a car] And motivation for a crime shouldn't affect the sentencing.
Stan
[flips the page to reveal warring groups of people around a question mark] Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
Kyle
[shows a rainbow of people holding hands] But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes [Stan flips the page to reveal their hate crime proposal]. For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we [flips the page to show them winning a sledding race] will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
Stan
That is our presentation. An idea that we call...
Token
[flips the page to reveal another copy of the title page] "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." [Kyle turns the tape player off]
Governor
Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I've heard in the last three years.
Outside Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Friday night. Alarms sound and searchlights abound, indicating someone has broken out. Footsteps are heard, and Cartman and Romper climb over a hill
Romper Stomper
Hurry up! They're sending the dogs after us! [Cartman runs ahead, Romper trips on a rock] Mph. Oowww!
Cartman
[turns around] What's the matter?
Romper Stomper
[looks up] It's my leg! I think it's broken. [looks back] You go on ahead without me.
Cartman
Uhokay. [turns and runs]
Romper Stomper
Hey. [Cartman stops and turns] You're supposed to say, "I'm not going without you," or something.
Cartman
Oh. Really?
Romper Stomper
Look, kid, you go on. You've got something to live out there. You've got friends.
Cartman
Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
Romper Stomper
I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here. I want you to have these. [offers his pails]
Cartman
Okay. [retrieves them]
Romper Stomper
No! You're supposed to say, "I can't take these," or something, dumbass!
Cartman
Oh. I can't take these. [offers them back]
Romper Stomper
Take them. They'll bring you luck. [looks back again] Now go on. Get out of here. [Cartman turns, walks some, and returns]
Cartman
Romper?
Romper Stomper
Yeah?
Cartman
You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
Guard
[shows up with other guards] Alright, freeze! [Cartman steps to Romper's side]
Cartman
You'll never take us alive! We're going down together, pigs!
Guard
But you've been pardoned by the governor! [shows the document]
Cartman
[takes it] O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. [walks away]
Phil Collins Hill, Saturday. The sledders are at the top of the run and other kids are at the finish line
Lizzy
[at the front of the girls' sled] Well, come on! Are we racing or not?!
Stan
Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
Kyle
He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
Lizzy
Come on, my feet are getting cold, fudge packers!
Bebe
Yeah. If you're too scared to race, just say so!
Kyle
Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
Stan
Alright, where's Clyde.
Clyde
[steps up] Right here.
Stan
Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
Clyde
For the last time, I'm not fat, so stop calling me fat, God-damnit! [realizes he's responded as Cartman would, and covers his mouth with both hands]
Kyle
On the sled, fatass!
Lizzy
Okay, girls. Time to show the boys what we can do!
Other girls
Yeah!
Butters
[steps into place with the starting flags] Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-
Cartman
[Butters looks up] You guys! [runs over a hill into view and races towards the group]
Stan
It's Cartman!
Boy Sledders
Hooray!
Cartman
That's right! I'm back! [Clyde walks over and hugs him, and he is surprised]
Clyde
Oh, thank you! Thank you for coming back! [relief creeps in] Thank you so much. Thank you.
Cartman
What the hell's wrong with Clyde?
Lizzy
This is your last chance! Are we racing or not?!
Stan
All right! Let's do this!
Butters
Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
Cartman
I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
Butters
Uh-get set. Go! [lowers the flags, and the girls shove off]
Cartman
Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
Kyle
Go, fatass!
Cartman
When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
Token, Kyle, Stan
Go, fatass! [Cartman shoves the sled into motion and hops on]
Stan
Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! [the camera looks at the slope. The girls come down first, then the boys]
Lizzy
We've got' em, girls!
Kyle
Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
Kids at Finish Line
Go! You can do it! Come on!
Stan
We're not gonna make it! [Cartman thinks, then he remembers.]
Cartman
Hey. [pulls out the pails and tosses them at the girls' sled]
Lizzy
G'aaaaah! [the pails gum up the reins. The girls' sled veers off the run and over a cliff. The weightlessness causes the girls and sled to separate, and all fall scattered on the ground below. A brown bear comes up]
Bear
Rowr. {carries Lizzy away]
Boy Sledders
[crossing the finish line] Hooray!
Stan
We did it!
Girls
Awww. [walk away disappointed, leaving only one blonde carrying a sign: GIRLS RULE]
Kyle
We won! We won!
Butters
Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
Boys
Hooray!
Kyle
It's good to have you back, Cartman.
Stan
Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
Cartman
Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
Pip
Let's all hear it for Cartman's big, fat ass! [no one does. Cartman picks up a rock and throws it at him] Oh-ff. [falls on his face. The rock lands next to Cartman]
Cartman
Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
Stan, Kyle, Butters, Token
Naah.
Cartman
Sweet.
Alamosa Juvenile Hall, later, Romper's cell. He is reading
Guard
Hey! Romper Stomper! Get up! [Romper gets up] You got a visitor! [rolls the door aside and Cartman enters]
Romper Stomper
Eric!
Cartman
Hey, Romper Stomper.
Romper Stomper
Wow! I've never had a visitor before!
Cartman
Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
Romper Stomper
You did? [Cartman goes to the door to make sure the guards are gone, then returns to Stomper]
Cartman
You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
Romper Stomper
Yeah. [Cartman walks off to the toilet]
Cartman
[begins grunting. A few moments later, and a grin breaks out on Stomper's face. A big splash follows] Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
Romper Stomper
Whoa! [end credits roll]
Cartman
Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh. [splash. Romper is stunned] Ogh! Wait-
Romper Stomper
Oh, yeah!
Cartman
[grunts some more] Uh, what else? [splash] Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! [grunts some more, then, splash]
Romper Stomper
Oh, the monorail!
End of Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000


Timmy 2000
South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison's classroom. The student stream in and take their seats
Stan
Dude, did you do all your homework last night?
Kyle
Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
Stan
I know!
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together? [the class sits silently] Let's see, how about...
Cartman
[praying softly at his desk] Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.
Mr. Garrison
Wendy?
Cartman
Phew!
Wendy
1776.
Mr. Garrison
Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?
Cartman
[praying] Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
Mr. Garrison
[points to] Kyle?
Cartman
Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
Kyle
The Declaration of Independence?
Mr. Garrison
Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence? [Cartman drops low in his seat so as to hide behind Butters, seated in front of him] Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy? [the camera and the class's eyes move to Timmy, who's grinning]
Timmy
Timmiihh!
Mr. Garrison
No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again.
Timmy
Heh-aaaaaah!
Mr. Garrison
Timmy, did you not do your homework?!
Timmy
Erh Timmiihh!!
Stan
Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
Mr. Garrison
Don't call people names, Stanley!
Stan
But he is-
Mr. Garrison
Now, Timmy,—
Timmy
Haaaaah.
Mr. Garrison
—You need to work on your study skills!
Timmy
Doo-uhh.
Mr. Garrison
Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!
Timmy
G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!
Mr. Garrison
THAT DOES IT!
The principal's office. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey talk to Timmy
Principal Victoria
Well, Timmy. I just don't know what to do with you. You're getting very poor marks in school and the teachers are complaining that you aren't paying attention.
Timmy
Heh-aaaaaah!
Mr. Mackey
Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!
Timmy
Timmiihh!
Principal Victoria
Well, that does it! I'm suspending you, Timmy, until you can learn to respect your elders! [pulls out a suspension form and starts filling it out]
Timmy
Ehhha-a-a-ah.
Mr. Mackey
Huh- hold on just a second there, Principal Victoria. [she stops writing] I think I may know what the problem is. [walks to Timmy and stands behind him, checking him out ]
Timmy
[softly] Timmiihh.
Mr. Mackey
Yes, of course.
Principal Victoria
What??
Mr. Mackey
[Timmy is grinning, enjoying himself] I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, "Attention Deficit Disorder," or ADD. It's very common in kids his age.
Principal Victoria
Oh!
Timmy
[turns right and zooms away] Timmiihh!
Principal Victoria
Well, that certainly would explain it.
Mr. Mackey
It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?
Timmy
[zooms across the room in the other direction] Oolih oo livin' a lie, Timmehuh!
A clinic. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey have taken Timmy there to see a doctor
Clinic Doctor
Alright, this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not Timmy has Attention Deficit Disorder.
Principal Victoria
Good.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay.
Timmy
Timmih.
Clinic Doctor
Egh. Now, Timmy, I'm going to read you a book called, "The Great Gatsby," by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I'll ask you a few questions. Are you ready?
Timmy
Timmih.
Clinic Doctor
[sits] Okay, here we go. [opens the book and clear his throat] "In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since" ["since since since since..." The clock reads 2:01, but the hours begin to roll by: 3:24, 5:55, 9:09...] "so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." [closes the book. Both Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria are asleep, his head resting on hers.]
Timmy
Ha-a-a-a-a-h.
Clinic Doctor
Okay now, Timmy. Can you tell me: In Chapter 7, what kind of car did Gatsby drive?
Timmy
[fiddles around some, then turns aside] Timmih!
Clinic Doctor
[rises and slams the book on the floor] Well, that settles it!
Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria
[sit up] Huh??
Clinic Doctor
This young man definitely has Attention Deficit Disorder!
Mr. Mackey
[rubs his eyes] Oh oh, I nuh-I knew it.
Principal Victoria
What can we do for him, doctor?
Clinic Doctor
Well, ADD is fairly common in kids today. I'm gonna prescribe some Ritalin, and we'll see how that goes for little Timmy.
Timmy
[softly] Timmih.
South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Garrison's classroom
Mr. Garrison
Hurry up, children, let's take our seats. [Timmy rolls up with a note attached to his head] You'd better have done your homework last night, Timmy. [sees the note] What's this? [peels it off and reads it]
Timmy
Tim-mih.
Mr. Garrison
A note from the principal? "Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder." [puts the note down] Oh, brother!
Stan
He doesn't have to do homework?
Mr. Garrison
That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!
Timmy
Timmih.
Mr. Garrison
Very well, I guess you're excused from homework.
Kyle
Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
Cartman
Yeah, me too.
Stan
I've got ADD.
Kenny
(Me too.)
Other classmates
Yeah, I've got it. Me too. Yeah. It's gay.
The clinic, later. The doctor is reading "A Farewell To Arms," by Ernest Hemingway, to the class now
Clinic Doctor
"After a while I went out and left the hospital, and walked back to the hotel in the rain." [sighs and closes the book. Kenny bangs his head against the wall cabinet. Tweek, Kyle, and Bebe sleep where they sit. Cartman is asleep on his back. Token, Stan, Wendy, Clyde, and Kevin are drowsy.] Alright now, in Chapter 12, what kind of bottles did Miss Van Campen talk about? [Kenny bangs head head again] Anybody? [Kenny bangs head head again] Anybody?? My God, these children all have ADD! [scribbles onto his notepad quickly]
All the kids
[sleepily] Hooray.
Cartman
[sleepily] Hoo-ray.
Clinic Doctor
It's Ritalin for all of you! [writes out prescriptions]
A house. Rock music is heard. Next, Skyler and his band are shown practicing. They now have a name: Lords of the Underworld. They play, but don't sing, and thrust their heads down from time to time.
Drummer
Dude, we suck!
Skyler
Hey, that's not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!
Jonesy
Dude, we never win the Battle of the Bands! It's no big deal.
Skyler
[disbelieving] Not a big deal! This year's winner gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalooblaza, and that's no big deal?!
Mark
Hey, you guys, you'd better stop fighting.
Skyler
We've just gotta practice more.
Jonesy
Dude, we've been practicing for eight years, Skyler.
Skyler
Hey, am I the leader of this band or not?! Huh, let's do it from the top! [the band starts up again, then pause]
Timmy
[outside] Timmuuhh! [the band riffs] Coodalah Timmuh!
Jonesy
[stops] What was that?
Skyler
Huh-I don't know, man. [picks up the garage door opener and presses the button. The door rises to the sound of an angelic choir and orchestra and reveals the bright light outside. And in that light is Timmy.] Whoaaa!
Mark
Who is that?
Timmy
Timmiihh!
Skyler
You a singer, man?
Timmy
Rrrrr-laurlaurlah Timmehah! [no reaction, but later, the band practices again. Timmy is with them now.] Timmehuh! [the band plays on, then stops] Timmehh.
Jonesy
Dude, that's hot!
Skyler
Yeah!
South Park Pharmacy, day. Ms. McCormick receives her son's prescription.
Pharmacist
There is your prescription, Ms. McCormick. A hundred dollars' worth of Ritalin.
Mrs. McCormick
And he won't have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?
Pharmacist
We can only hope so. Next? [the camera pulls back to show a line of kids with their moms. Kenny and his mom leave, and Stan arrives with his mom]
Sharon
Oh, hi, Sheila.
Sheila
Sharon, your son has Attention Deficit Disorder too?
Sharon
Yes. I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the '30s.
Sheila
I know what you mean. Kyle gets so hyper, sometimes he runs around and screams like a little eight-year-old.
Kyle
...I am eight.
Pharmacist
Next, please? [Liane hands him the prescription] What do we have here- ah! The Ritalin!
Liane
Yes.
Cartman
That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
Liane
Mr. Pharmacist, this Ritalin doesn't have any side effects, does it?
Pharmacist
Oh, no no, your son may experience a small lack of energy, but that's all.
Liane
Alright.
Pharmacist
Oh, and he might start seeing little pink Christina Aguilera monsters, but that's to be expected.
Liane
Oh my.
South Park Battle Of The Bands. A four-member band is onstage. One member is on keyboards, a second is on drums, a third on guitar, and the fourth has the mic. The first and third have flaming hairdos
Band
Look alive, lettin' it feel (so light). Lettin' it feel so light.
People in Audience
Boooo!
Guy in flat top
You suck! [others laugh. The band clears out as the M.C. approaches the mic]
M.C.
Alright, that was "Sisters of Mercy Hold No Pain Against the Dark Lord," with their song, "Silk Blood On The Footsteps Of My Mind (Revisited)"
Singer
We got the best response. We'll be opening for Phil Collins for sure.
M.C.
And now it's time for our final band.
Guy in Audience
Thank God! [others laugh]
M.C.
Give it up for "Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld!" [the curtains part amid a smattering of applause to reveal the Lords of the Underworld and Timmy rolls up to the mic. The audience is stunned]
Skyler
1 2 3 4 [the Lords launch into their song]
Timmy
Timmih! [a riff] Timmih! Lehmeheuh! [confused looks on people's faces] Timmih!
Man 1
Duhude, that handicapped dude ruhules!
Man 2
Oo-yee-hee-yeh-hah!
Man 3
You guys are terrible! How could you laugh at that poor kid?!
Timmy
Timmih Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!

!The Lords
Lords of the Underworld.

Timmy
Timmih, Timmiih!

The Lords
Darkness fills my heart with pain.

Timmy
Timmih oo livin' a lie! [the four boys arrive]

Stan
Dude, it's Timmy.
Kyle
No way! [Timmy says something incomprehensible]
Man 3
They're ridiculing that singer! ["habah kulaa!"]Come on, let's get outta here! [leaves with three others]
Timmy
Sibilah Sibinlaahh! [keeps babbling]

The Lords
The Lords of the Underworld.

Timmy
Timmih, Timmih Timmitimmi Timmiih!

The Lords
Darkness fills my heart with pain. [the song ends. Someone is carried across the field by the crowd]

Timmy
Timmehahh! Timmeh Timmeh Sibinlah Timmih Sibinlah Timmih. Timmuh Timmuh Timmuh. [one last power chord] Timmeh!

Cartman
That was awesuhome!
Stan
Yeah, Timmy ruhules!
Woman
Boys! You shouldn't laugh at him! He's handicapped!
Stan
But he's funny.
Woman
How would you like to be handicapped?! Do you think that would be funny?! You're making him feel bad!
Timmy
[basking in the applause] Hehaahh!
Kyle
He looks pretty happy to me.
Woman
Oh, you people make me sick! [walks away]
M.C.
Dude, this is a no-brainer. This year's Battle of the Bands winner and the band that gets to open for Phil Collins at Lalapalablala is... TIMMY!
Crowd
[roars in approval] Wooo!
Jonesy
[flexes his arms] We did it, dude!
Skyler
[moves forward] Listen to them. They really love me. [bows] Wooo!!
Crowd
[responds] Wooo!!
Skyler
Yes! I'm a rocker! [he and Jonesy throw their arms up in victory]
PSB presents Charlie Rose
Charlie Rose
Tonight, we analyze the new rock sensation, Timmeo [a clip of it at the Battle of the Bands], the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm. [the crowd cheers and holds up "TIMMY" signs. A woman lifts up her blouse to reveal her bra] Already playing at several large venues this month [the band is shown coming off a plane. Cameras flash at Timmy with the Lords of the Underworld behind him], the band prepares for its biggest gig, Lolapalooblaza, where they will open for Phil Collins. But Phil Collins is not happy.
Phil Collins
[in the middle of a street holding his Oscar] Well, I thinks it's a horrible tragedy, idn't it? I mean, people aren't gonna see Timmy for his musical skills. They're laughin' at 'im, and I think you shouldn't laugh at people with disabilities!
Man
[appears in the background and points at Phil] Hah haha.
Phil Collins
Society has to learn how to be more compassionate! This is gonna stop if I have to stop it myself!
Bus stop, next day. Stan and Kyle await the bus
Kyle
Dude, did you see that stuff Phil Collins was saying about Timmy?
Stan
Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
Cartman
[arrives with Kenny and speaks mellowly] Hey guys, have you been takin' your Ritalin?
Stan
Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
Cartman
No, dude, you gotta try it. [hands a bottle to Kyle] It makes you feel good.
Kenny
[also mellow] (Good.) [Kyle takes a couple of pills, then tosses the bottle to Stan]
South Park Elementary, day, kitchen
Chef
Hello there, children.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
Hello, Chef.
Kenny
(Hello, Chef.)
Chef
How's it goin'?
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
Very well, thank you.
Kenny
(Very well, thank you.)
Chef
[incredulous] Everything's fine?? Why??
Stan
Because we're on Ritalin.
Chef
What??
Kyle
We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
Cartman
It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. [shakes two pills out of his bottle and swallows them]
Chef
So that's why all you children are acting so damned boring!
Kyle
That's correct, Chef.
Chef
Damnit, children, you don't need drugs to make you pay attention in school! In my day, if we didn't pay attention we got a belt to the bottom! Now they're tryin' to cure everything with drugs!
Kyle
Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
Stan
Oh boy oh boy.
Kenny
(Oh boy.)
Chef
Oh, it makes me sick! Those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin' about the side effects.
Stan
But there are no side effects, Chef.
Kyle
No, not at all. [Cartman looks away and a Christina Aguilera monster appears]
Christina Aguilera monster
Rown! [Cartman rubs his eyes, and she's gone]
Cartman
Did you guys see that?
Stan
See what?
MTV News. A satellite revolves around the logo
Announcer
You're watching MTV, the cool, brainwashing, twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image. We're so cool that we decide what's cool. And now, MTV News, the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country. Which is cool. Here's your host, Kurt Loder.
Kurt Loder
[framed by seven monitors showing the following: the MTV logo, The Cure's Robert Smith, a rotating Earth, Ozzy Osbourne, KoRn, Elton John, and Rick James] Why am I still doing this? I've got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years.
Announcer
[the logo takes up the whole screen] Kurt Loder didn't just say that. No way, he did just say it, but just to be cool. That's what makes him cool. You think Kurt Loder is cool. And now, the news that's cool.
Kurt Loder
Well, it's only two weeks until Lalapalalababa, and the headlining band has changed. Now headlining the event is Timmy [a shot of him], the new hit sensation out of Colorado. This news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline Lalapalabala, Phil Collins.
Phil Collins
[now in South Park with his Oscar] Well, I think the sad question is, "Where are the parents in all this?" I mean, that kid's parents are lettin' him be exploited, and they don't even seem to care.
Kurt Loder
[A limo with police escort pulls up to a house] And so, Phil Collins decided to travel to South Park and personally pay Timmy's parents a visit. [Phil gets out of the limo and goes to the front door]
Phil Collins
[in the living room] Well, I mean, why are you lettin' 'em do this to your son? Don't you see that everyone's just laughin' at him?
Richard
Richarrrrd!
Helen
Helennnn!
Richard
'Oodleahah.
Kurt Loder
Phil Collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play Lalapalablalala, and vows to do everything in his power to stop it. Phil Collins, by the way, divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old. I'm Kurt Loder, and that's the news.
South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison's class. The school bell rings
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, let's settle down! [the class is seated and attentive] Huhh I mean it; I want quiet! [the class is already quiet] My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin. [Clyde rubs his nose] Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?! [draws the words out slowly, but the class remains silent] Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex. [no one moves] Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!
Cartman
[Clyde is a bit shocked] What kind of smartass thing would I say, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
[grabs his head a few times] This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
Kyle
Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? [has the bottle out. Mr. Garrison thinks a bit, then goes for the bottle, opens it up, and chugs some pills down]
Cartman
There you go. [smiles, then frowns]
Christina Aguilera monster
[comes out from behind Mr. Garrison's desk] Rowr.
Cartman
Whah!
Mile High Stadium: "Tonight Only. TIMMY!!! Sold Out."
A singer
Thank you, Baltimore! Good night!
Jonesy
[exits the dressing room with the other band members] Alright, let's rock this house! Hello Miami!
Timmy
Timmiihh! [Skyler trails the others, and Phil Collins appears in a hallway intersection next to the dressing room]
Phil Collins
Excuse me, Skyler Morse?
Skyler
[stops and turns] Yeah?
Phil Collins
Nice to meet you. I'm Phil Collins.
Skyler
Oh, yeah. You're opening for us as Lalapalazabla.
Phil Collins
I just wanted to tell you that, well, I think that you're a great guitar player and song writer.
Skyler
Oh, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Gotta run. [turns and starts walking away]
Phil Collins
It's too bad those other guys are holdin' you back.
Skyler
[stops and looks back] Huh?
Phil Collins
Well, I mean, it's obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you. Strange, how everyone focuses n Timmy, idn't it? I mean, even the name of the band is "Timmy,"
Skyler
Nuh-nn, the name of the band is Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld.
Phil Collins
Look, I used to be in a band, too. Genesis. And all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back. But then, finally, I went solo. And that's when I started writing really great songs. But look, if you happen to be on the sidelines, you know, bein' more of a cheerleader than a player, well, then I guess you should stay on as Timmy's shadow.
Skyler
[dejected, walks away and looks back] Uh, thanks man. See ya.
Phil Collins
That should just about put an end to all this Timmy nonsense. [kisses his Oscar]
Mile High Stadium, later.
Timmy
Timmuh! [the Lords of the Underworld have finished their song]
Jonesy
[leads the others into the dressing room] Another great show, man. There must have been a hundred thousand people out there.
Skyler
[tosses his guitar aside] Yeah. All of them chanting "Timmy, Timmy."
Timmy
[rolls in] Timmih!
Jonesy
What's the matter, Skyler?
Skyler
The name of the band is Timmy AND the Lords of the Underworld, not just Timmy.
Timmy
Timmiihh!
Skyler
And the Lords of the Underworld!
Timmy
Timmiihh!
Skyler
It's always about you, isn't it?! I'm sick of it! Timmy gets all the applause! Timmy gets all the chicks! Well, you know what?! Forget you, man!
Mark
Skyler, Timmy is what made our band famous.
Skyler
[spins around and points] Shut up, Monsy! You can stay and deal with Mr. Egomaniac here, but I'm movin' on! [heads for the door] I don't need Timmy! [grabs Monsy's guitar on the sofa] I'm goin' solo!
Timmy
Timmiihh!
Skyler
[at the door] No! Don't try and stop me, man! [turns to exit] I'll see you on fame's backside. [leaves]
Timmy
Ooo livin' a lie!
Cartman's house, next day. The boys are on the sofa watching Terrance and Phillip. Stan has his Ritalin, Cartman has the remote... and a pan on his laps. He's eating bacon
Phillip
Terrance, what brand of pants am I wearing?
Terrance
[bends to look] Let me see. [Phillip farts on him and they crack up]
Phillip
How do you like that, Terrance?
Stan
Let's watch something else.
Kyle
Yes, let's. [Cartman starts channel-surfing, then stops]
Announcer
You're watching VH1.
The Boys
Ahhhh.
Anchor
Here's Lalapalalala's news. The hit group Timmy has broken up.
Stan
Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
Anchor
And so, Phil Collins is back on as the headliner. The opening band now will be Timmy's guitarist Skyler's new solo project, Reach for the Skyler.
Kyle
You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
Stan
Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
Cartman
I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
Kyle
Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
Stan
Sounds good.
Cartman
So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us. [a Christina Aguilera bug is crawling all over Kenny] Hooray. [looks] Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. [takes his pan and swings it at Kenny. It strikes, and Kenny's face is smashed in. Kenny falls forward, hits the floor, and a puddle of blood forms under him]
Stan
Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.
Kyle
Bastard.
The Marsh house. Several parents are gathered in the living room. Chef speaks
Chef
Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin' your children on Ritalin. [Along with Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Tweek's parents, Liane Cartman, Craig's parents, and another set of parents are present]
Randy
Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
Chef
I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative' to Ritalin. There's this doctor in Northern California who is doin' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. [puts in the tape. The VCR does the rest]
Dr. Shay
Hello, I'm Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder. [three kids are in a classroom setting, acting up. Dr. Shay enters] This treatment is fast and effective and doesn't use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child.
Girl
[Dr. Shay walks up to her and listens as she rattles off] I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara- [he smacks her behind the ear] Ah!
Dr. Shay
Sit down and study! [she looks at him scared, then picks up a book and opens it, looking at him all the while. He moves on to the boy in the middle desk]
Boy 1
Woohoo, let's go sledding, let's go race and race, let's go! [Dr. Shay smacks him too, making him turn aside. He turns back]
Dr. Shay
Sit down and study!
Boy 1
[looks at him, then starts crying] Wwaaahahahahaaha [Dr. Shay smacks him again. The other boy stops and looks]
Dr. Shay
Stop crying and do your schoolwork! [the boy opens his book. He and the girl start reading. The Dr. moves over to the other boy, and he just cracks open his book and reads. The doctor address the camera] If you would like more information on my bold new treatments, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, "You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again." Thank you. [Chef turns the tape off]
Chef
Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.
Sharon
That video had pretty colors.
Gerald
It sure did.
Chef
What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children's Ritalin too?!
Parents
Yes.
Chef
Awww, fudge it! [throws the remote aside. The boys enter]
Stan
Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
Chef
The what?
Kyle
Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala's, and because we're all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.
Parents
Yes.
Chef
Hold on a second: you children want to go see Phil Collins?
Kyle
Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
Chef
Oh my God!!
Kyle
Come, see him with us.
Cartman
Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it's Christina Aguilera again! [runs around] She's on my back! Hah! [leaves]
Chef
That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I'm going to go see that damn pharmacist!
South Park Pharmacy, after hours. The pharmacist and the clinic doctor are talking, and the doctor counts some money
Pharmacist
Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.
Clinic Doctor
That's easily another twenty grand apiece! [the pharmacist laughs and Chef arrives]
Chef
[pounds on the door] Hey, open this damn door. [the doctor and pharmacist cover the money and go to the front door.]
Pharmacist
Can I help you?
Chef
Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!
Clinic Doctor
Well, they've all been diagnosed with ADD. That's Attention Deficit-
Chef
I know what it is! But now you've got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.
Clinic Doctor
Huh?
Chef
All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don't!
Clinic Doctor
Hey now, don't tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-
Chef
You're damn right I'll tell you yo' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!
Pharmacist
Eh wuh, what?? [he and the doctor are shocked]
Chef
That's right! You've made them so dull and boring that they're actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!
Clinic Doctor
Mm- my God. What have we done?? [beings to weep]
Pharmacist
Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God! [beings to weep as well]
Chef
Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!
Clinic Doctor
We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it'll be hard to get it away from them.
Chef
Then we need an antidote!
Pharmacist
Yes, of course.
Clinic Doctor
Uh, what's the antidote for Ritalin?
Pharmacist
I have some right here. [takes a bottle from a medicine case] It's a compound called "Ritalout."
Chef
Alright. Come on, we've got to get the antidote to all the children. Quick! [rushes out]
Welcome to
LALAPALALAPAZA!!

Townsfolk file in. Music is piped in before the concert

Phil Collins
[the crowds clap to the rhythm]
Last night I went, "O!"
Bubudio
Last night I went "Bubudio"

Chef
[leads the doctor and pharmacist to a lemonade stand.] Here. We can put the Ritalin antidote in these drinks and hand them out to the children. ["Last night I went 'Bubudio.'" The pharmacist starts placing the Ritalout tablets in the drinks]
Phil Collins
Last night I went, "O!" Bububudio. [takes a bow. People clap a bit]

Randy
Wasn't that great, son?
Stan
Sure was, Dad.
Gerald
It's so wonderful to be on the same wavelength as our kids.
Chef
[arrives with a tray of lemonade] Here you go, Stan and Kyle. Free drinks on me. [Kyle reaches for his drink and takes a sip]
Stan
Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. [takes a glass. He and Kyle drink at the same time as Chef leaves]
Phil Collins
I know. I'd like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitled,
"You'll Be In... Me." [goes to the piano, sets the Oscar on the piano top and starts playing it] Thanks. You're inside of me. Deep inside of me. [Chef hands drinks to more kids] So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart.

Chef
Come on, drink it down. It's free.
Cartman
You'll be inside of me...

Christina Aguilera monster
[appears on his shoulder] Rowr.
Cartman
Huh? Oh no! Agh! [tries to shake it off as it nibbles on his shoulder] Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
Stan
I feel... different.
Kyle
Yeah. [the monster munches loudly on Cartman]
Cartman
Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh[the monster still munches on him as he rolls on the ground]
Chef
[arrives] Drink this, Eric. [pours the lemonade Ritalout into Cartman's mouth, and the Christina Aguilera monster dissolves] God help me! Heh, get it... [turns over on his stomach] She's gone! Thank God!
Phil Collins
[looks at the audience] Well, thanks! [continues playing. The camera focuses on Stan and Kyle...]
Stan
Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
Kyle
Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
Chef
[returns to the doctor and pharmacist] I think it's working.
Audience
Booooo!!
Phil Collins
[stops the music] Shut your filthy holes, you little bastards!
Stan
Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
Kyle
Yeah!
Phil Collins
You just wanna laugh at him.
Stan
No! [steps forward] You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
Kyle
Yeah! Tim-my! Tim-my!
Audience
Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!
A desert near town. Mark and Timmy stand outside, Jonesy sits on the running board
Jonesy
Man, it sucks not being part of Lalapalabala. [The cry begins to reach them: "Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Mark
Yeah. ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Skyler
[returns to the band] Hey dudes. ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Jonesy
Skyler, what are you doing here?! ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"] Isn't Reach for the Skyler supposed to play soon? ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Skyler
They booed Phil Collins off the stage. Everyone's chanting for Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld. ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Mark
["Tim-my!"] Oh, so now that they want us, you think you can waltz, um, back into our lives and be in the band again? ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Skyler
I don't expect anything. Timmy, I-gh... Well, I just wanted to say we had some pretty rockin' times, dude, and... maybe I let fame and Phil Collins go to my head... ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Timmy
Timmih! ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Jonesy
[stands] Wow. They really are chanting for us. ["Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Mark
Hn they want us back. ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Skyler
What do you say, Timmy? ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
Timmy
Rrr, rrr, uh, Timmih. ["Tim-my! Tim-my!"]
The Lords
Alright!
The Lalapalalapaza concert.
Host
Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it is my pleasure to introduce the reunion tour of Timmehuh!
Timmy
[rolls up to the mic] Timmiihh, and the Lords of the Underworld! [Skyler looks over at Timmy with pride, then starts the band up] Timmiihh! [he's learned to move like the other band members do] Timmih! Livin' a lie-ah! [Stan and Kyle grin. Kyle then waves. Chef, the pharmacist and the doctor sway to the music] Hidilah Timmy! [his parents, Richard and Helen, are there] Timmuh- Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!

The Lords
And the Lords of the Underworld.

Phil Collins
[being moved over the audience] Put me down, you filthy bastards! [he's turned face down, and his Oscar is sticking out of his ass] Awwww!
Timmy
Timmiihh uluh-livin' a lie!

End credits roll, and Timmy and the Lords of the Underworld play on.
End of Timmy 2000

Quintuplets 2000
The Marsh house, night. Some of the families are gathered there
Randy
Okay, is everyone ready to go?
Sheila
Oh, I'm so excited. I've always wanted to see Cirque du Cheville.
Sharon
Me too. We were lucky to get tickets. [calls out] Come on, boys! We're gonna be late. [the boys, dressed in their Sunday best, walk in with heads down in resentment]
Liane
Oh, don't they look precious?
Stan
Why do we have to dress up? Isn't this just a circus, with elephants and lions and stupid clowns
Sharon
No, Stanley. Cirque du Cheville is French-Canadian. They get acrobats and singers from all over the world and then do very artistic things..
Kyle
Awwww!
Grandpa
[rolls up] Why the hell do you wanna take these boys to see that fufu French theater crap? You're gonna turn them into poofders!
Sharon
Dad, Stanley needs to see the arts!
Grandpa
Well, he doesn't need to see a bunch of frogs prance around in tights and make-up wrappin' their peckers around each other's faces!
Sharon
Come on, everybody, let's go. [the others turn and head out the front door.]
Grandpa
[follows] Close your eyes and cover your ears, Billy! Remember, you're a man.
Cirque du Cheville, night. Folks are streaming in to get seats. Next, under the Big Top
Sheila
Oh, this is so exciting
Sharon
Oh, look at the funny clown, Stanley.
Stan
Where? [a clown appears next to him, and he looks up] Oh, no. [the clown pulls out an umbrella and a bicycle horn, squeezes the horn and gets showered by the umbrella. The adults laugh, and the clown offers him the umbrella] Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye. [the clown insists Stan take part, and the parents laugh at the sound of the horn] No, thank you. [the clown tries again] Go away, please.
Cartman
He doesn't want your dumbass umbrella, clown! Beat it! [Liane smacks him on the back of the head] Ow. [the clown tries once more with Stan. Stan rolls his eyes, takes the umbrella, and is showered by it when the clown presses the horn. The crowd roars with laughter as the clown revels in his cleverness]
Randy
You didn't know that was gonna happen, did you, Stanley? [Stan looks up angrily]
Cartman
[comments] Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! [the clown gets mad as Cartman talks, then takes the umbrella from Stan and walks away in a huff]
Announcer
[affecting a French accent] Ladies and gentlemen, please, no smoking and no flash-photography during Sarque du Son Bleu
Cartman
[echoes the announcer] Sarque du Son Bleu. [sticks his tongue out. A performer comes out and starts singing] Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
Liane
Eric, sshhhh. [the performer is joined by men rolling by in wheels behind him and others prancing by in front. The parents smile in awe]
Kyle
How long does this thing last?
Stan
Two hours.
Cartman, Kyle, Kenny
Awwwgh.
Cirque du Cheville, later. A troupe of twelve dancers leap high and drop down again. The parents are still in thrall, and their eyes follow the dancers' leaps. Cartman is now asleep. Some time elapses, and a singer sings her song. The other three boys are getting sleepy. The smiles are gone from the parents' faces. The singer is shown with a two-person high-wire act overhead. Little "birds" pop out from her dress and dance around. A new act appears, and Stan is looking away feeling bored. Kyle and Kenny seem more awake. An invisible man in a visible suit walks on, and a green man with big ears jumps out of the floor in front of him. The green man and the man shake hands, and the green man rips the man's right arm off. A new act comes on, and Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are really drowsy. The curtains open to reveal five girls, and they come forward to dance
Sharon
Ooo, these are the contorting quintuplets from Romania. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are curious. Each of the quints lays on her stomach and puts her feet over her back and on her head.]
Kenny
(Woohoo!) [Stan and Kyle stir, and Kyle nudges Cartman]
Cartman
Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? [the quints pile on to make an X, then roll off and reposition themselves into a circle]
Kyle
Whoa. [a few twirls, and the middle one is thrust into the air. The two girls on the outside leap up and land on the other two's heads and catch the middle girl, to form a pentagon. Then they form a large cat, then a yacht,...]
Stan
Damn, dude. [...then the Eiffel Tower, and finally, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The crowd cheers]
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
Yayy!
Kenny
(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)
Cirque du Cheville, dismissal. The crowd exits the tent
Sheila
Oh, that was wonderful!
Sharon
Yes. Too bad it was their last show, or I'd go see it again.
Kyle
Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
Cartman
Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
Kyle
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
Cartman
Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! [they pass "LE SOUVENIRS," a booth manned by a clown dressed in yellow.]
Clown
[the boys turn to see him] Don't forget to buy your souvenirs, folks. [the adults gather and clamor for the items on display. As they do, the boys talk]
Stan
Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
Cartman
Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
Kyle
Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Stan
Yeah. This one's moving out of town, so we could take over. [the boys turn to leave]
Kyle
Let's go practice. [they exit]
Dressing Room #1. "Vladchick Contorting Quintuplets" is written over a star.
Grandmama
Hurry up, girls. We must bundle up against the cold.
A Quint
Did we do good final show, Grandmama?
Grandmama
Very good, my girls. I only wish it weren't your last show. I love this country so very much. [a knock on the dressing room door, and two stern men walk in]
Romanian official
Mrs. Vladchick, it is time. It is time to return to Romania.
Grandmama
Yes, yes, of course. Just give me vone second to finish getting them ready. [the men leave, and she looks to the dressing room window. She walks over, opens the window, turns, and] This way, girls. Quickly. [the girls head for the window. Grandmama lifts them out one by one.]
Quint #2
Vhy are we going out the window, Grandmama?
Grandmama
Your mother did not want you to grow up in Romania. This is our only chance. [drops the girl off outside]
Romanian official
Nid kelmin da bushka.
Attendant
Nid kelmin da lushka velt
Romanian official
Nid kelmin da bushka ayn zolt! [the men laugh, the attendant looks at his watch]
Attendant
M-Mrs. Vladchick? [the men enter and find the open window and no one at all]
Romanian official
Dash fam da bushka!
Cirque du Cheville, outside the main tent. The two Romanian men rush out
Attendant
They're trying to defect! [they rush up to the end of a dock just as Mrs. Vladchick and her granddaughters take off in a dinghy]
Romanian official
[pumping a fist] Cauch! We need a boat. [sees two native men in a canoe, about to leave. He and the attendant walk over to them and gives one of the paddlers some money]
Native paddler in vest
Where to, Mack?
Romanian official
[gets on the canoe] Follow that boat. [the attendant gets on, and the four men paddle away]
The Marsh house, living room. The boys have bought a CD of the show, and Kenny sings to the instrumental of one of the songs. Kenny is wearing the costume the first singer wore. The other three are practicing... um... Stan tries to leap into Kyle's arms, but they end up tumbling on the floor. Cartman runs forth and does some cartwheels, but lands on a coffee table, breaking it to pieces.
Stan
Dude, this isn't working.
Kyle
It's Kenny's singing!
Kenny
(Hunh?)
Cartman
Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
Kenny
(I'm singing as good as I can!)
Stan
Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! [Grandpa rolls by and notices the boys in dance poses]
Grandpa
Aha, I knew it. They turned you into poofders.
Stark's Pond. Grandmama and the girls zoom away.
Romanian Official
There's nowhere to go, Mrs. Vladchick. Pull over! [the canoe has caught up to the dinghy. Mrs. Vladchick looks back, then looks forward. They are closing in on a dock full of explosives, and she looks on in horror]
Grandmama
Okay girls, the Cam Ay Alta. [the girls pile on Grandmama and form a tower, each female grabbing the head of the one below her. The top girl grabs a branch with a free hand, and all swing up in the air as one. The dinghy goes on with the canoe in pursuit]
Romanian Official
[In a high pitched voice] Be careful, Gabul! Be careful, Gabul! Yaaah! [the canoe runs into the dock and they both blow up. Pieces of the four men fall from the air.]
Top Girl
Did we do good, Grandmama?
Grandmama
Very good, Glacas.
The 'camera' pulls back to reveal the entire high speed chase took place on Stark's Pond which is about 7 canoe lengths long.
The Marsh house. Snow falls outside. The other boys have gone home
Stan
I'm tired, Grandpa.
Grandpa
No, Billy! You're gonna stay here and watch more MacGyver. We've gotta get all the Frenchy-poo fag-nasties out of ya. [the doorbell rings] Who the hell would be ringin' the doorbell at this time of night?
Stan
I don't know. [walks over and opens the door] Whoa. [before him are the contorting Romanian quintuplets and their Grandmama, all shivering. Randy and Sharon show up in their pajamas]
Grandmama
We are very sorry to disturb you. My granddaughters are cold and tired. Is there any possibility we could pay you for a place to sleep?
Randy
You're from Cirque du Cheville. [Grandpa shows up]
Grandmama
Yes. We- missed our train. If we could shelter here; it would only be for one night.
Randy
Well...
Sharon
Well, of course you can. Come in out of the snow. [the girls grin and enter]
Grandmama
Oh, thank you so much. [walks in]
Sharon
There's some spare bedrooms upstairs, Mrs....?
Grandmama
Vladchick. [Sharon escorts her and the girls upstairs]
Grandpa
That Grandma is not a bad piece of ass.
Randy
Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!
Grandpa
Well, it's good for 'im.
The McCormick house. Kenny is in his room with three books on his bed.
Kenny
[reads "Learning to Sing Better"] (Let's see... No, not there) [tosses the book away and picks up "The Essence of Voicing"] (Let's see. Nothing there) [tosses it away and picks up "Singing like Bocelli for Dummies"] (Let's see... here!) [pulls out a tape and pops it into his tape player]
Narrator
Hello, and welcome to: "Singing like Bocelli for Dummies." Lesson 1: Yaaayayeha!
Kenny
(Yaaayaya.)
Narrator
Lesson 2: Hehyayaya hehyayaya!
Kenny
(Hehyayaya hehyayaya!)
Narrator
Good: And now we'll do the entire piece, "Con Te Partirт" [music begins to play]
Kenny
[leafs through the book] (Con Te Partirт?) [leafs some more and find it. A rat crawls onto the bed as Kenny looks at the tape player, looks around and leaves. Kenny immediately improves and begins singing like a Prima Divo, yet still characteristically Kenny-muffled...](...Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.con te io li rivivrт. 'Con te...)[...and it becomes background music as the camera pans over to...]
'Camera' pans from the McCormick house across the railroad tracks to the Marsh house. Kenny's voice is so powerful it can be heard clearly in the Marsh upper bedroom. Grandmama Vladchick is in her nightgown combing her hair. Grandpa Marsh rolls by
Kenny
(...partirт.)
Grandpa
[startles Grandmama] Got everything you need there, do ya?
Kenny
(Su navi per mari)
Grandmama
Yes. You're avefully soo kind to my little granddaughters.
Kenny
(che, io lo so,)
Grandpa
They're quite agile little things, aren't they?
Kenny
(no, no, non esistono piщ.)
Grandmama
Yes, as I was back in my day. I was a contortionist, too.
Kenny
(con te io li rivivrт.)
Grandpa
Y'don't say. [strokes his chin]
Grandmama
Yes.
Grandpa
You...
Kenny
(Con te...)
Grandpa
...remember any of that stuff, do ya? [she looks flattered and intrigued.]
Kenny
(...partirт.Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.)[as Kenny sings, Grandpa returns to Mrs. Vladchick's room naked... and without the wheelchair. She lifts up her left leg over her head, then lets it go. Kenny's getting into the song. The tape speeds up a bit...]'(Io con te...!)
Grandpa
Ah. [A leg wraps around his chest] Oh. [a second leg wraps around his head] Ah! [an arm appears, then Mrs. Vladchick's head, then a third leg...] Oh. [Kenny is seen on bended knee on his bed during the last note, as Grandmama Vladchick and Grandpa reach climax.] Oh-oooh-oooh!
The McCormick house, Kenny's room. The music stops with a thump and Kenny collapses on his bed exhausted
Narrator
And now lesson 4: the complete works of Mozart. Let's begin.
Kenny
[looks at the radio] (Damn!)
The Marsh house, morning. Randy and Sharon are in the kitchen enjoying some coffee
Sharon
What should we do, Randy? I like these Romanians fine, but I hope that old woman isn't planning on staying here much longer.
Randy
Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.
Sharon
Poor dear must be tired.
Grandpa
[rolls in] You're damn right she's tired.
Randy
Huh?
Grandpa
Oh, nothin'. She's just gonna have a little trouble walkin' today is all. [rolls out].
The Marsh house, outside. Stan leads the other three boys in the side gate and to the backyard
Stan
Hurry up, you guys!
Cartman
What's going on?
Stan
Dude, you're not gonna believe this.
Kyle
What?! [they all turn, and the quints stand before them]
Quint 1
Hello.
Quint 2
Hello.
Quint 3
Hi.
Quint 4
Hello.
Cartman
No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
Stan
Yeah. They're quintuplets from Romania.
Kyle
What's a "quin-tuplet"?
Quint 2
Ve are twins, except there are five of us instead of two.
Kyle
But there's only four of you.
Quint 2
No no, Natalia is just playing mirror buddies with Nadia.
Nadia
[steps out from behind Natalia] Hello.
Kyle
So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
All five quints in unison
No, don't be ridiculous.
Stan
Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
A Quint
You have your own?
Stan
Well, not yet. Kenny has to get better at singing first.
Kenny
(Hey!)
Cartman
But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
Quint 1
Okay.
Quint 3
Sounds good.
Quint 2
Count me in.
Quint 5
Okay. [quint 4 says nothing, and the others look at her]
Quint 4
...Oh, and me.
The boys
All right!
The Marsh house, kitchen
Randy
Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up. [leaves, reaches Grandmama's room, and knocks] Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman? [knocks twice more] Ma'am? [opens the door, looks in, and flies are heard buzzing around. Mrs. Vladchick is stiff, mouth open, arms up as if holding someone. Randy shuts the door in horror, then opens it and looks in again to be sure, then shuts it again, horrified]
Grandpa
[rolls up] Well, all tuckered, is she? Ha ha ha ha.
Randy
[serious] No, Dad.
Grandpa
A little cottony in the crotch? Hr hr hr hr.
Randy
No, Dad, she's dead!
Grandpa
What?! [Randy opens the door and looks away, Grandpa rolls in to see for himself] Oh, dear Jesus!
Randy
It looks like she had a heart attack.
Grandpa
No wonder she didn't say good-night.
Randy
[stares at him, then leans away] ...Ew!
The Marsh house, the backyard
Stan
Okay, hold it, hold it. [climbs over Cartman and Kyle to form a tower. The quintuplets have executed their X formation. Stan is trying to stand when all three boys tumble to the ground. The quints break their formation and drop down]
The boys
Ow! [Randy and Sharon walk out and approach the kids]
Sharon
I don't know how to tell. You tell them. [they stop]
Randy
Uh, girls, we... have some bad news.
Quint 5
What?
Randy
Um... [Sharon holds his hand] Everyone who has a grandma, step forward. [Stan and Cartman step forward, then the girls] Uh, not so fast, girls. [Sharon gasps and glares at him. The girls step back, then realize what has just happened. They begin to sob]
Sharon
Randy! [amid the sobs, some of the quints have questions]
Quint 2
Grandmama is dead?
Quint 1
What are we going to do now? [Randy and Sharon stand there helplessly]
Cartman
[in a low voice] You guys, come here. [steps forward. The others join him] This is totally awesome.
Stan
What?!
Kyle
How can you say that?
Cartman
Because now we can convince them to stay here, and now our circus will kick ass!
Kyle
Oh, yeah!
Stan
[rushes up] Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
Randy
Well, Stan, it's not really our-
Stan
They have nowhere else to go. [presses hands together] Please?
Sharon
Well, for the time being I, I mean, of course they can stay.
Stan, Kyle
Hooray!
Cartman
Hooray!
The Marsh house, the backyard, some days later. Neighborhood men and women walk up to a fenced-in area of the yard in which the quints play with various toys and balls
Reporter
Tom, I'm standing at the home in South Park where five precious little girls have been rescued from Romania. Their mother passes away some months ago, and then their grandmother died trying to bring them here. But all is well now, and people are coming from all over the country to view the little tykes. [someone takes a picture] If you'd like to come down and visit the quintuplets, admission is only $5, and for a few dollars more ["FEED THE QUINTS! One Dollar" A man buys some fishsticks], you can feed them fishsticks.
A Quint
[hops up and down, then opens her mouth for a fishstick the man drops down to her] Mmm.
Reporter
Tom, it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call Romania.
Romania, daytime with grey sky. Pan across grey, dismal, identical blocky buildings. Government officials watch the report in a run-down office
Reporter
Yes, luckily for them, these quintuplets no longer have to live in Romania, the asshole of the world. [a last shot of the quints is seen] Back to you, Tom.
President
This is not good. It makes our country look poor and stupid.
Romanian Official
This could kill our tourism.
President
You know what to do. [they salute him and leave.]
South Park School of Music
Instructor
[at the piano] Alright, Kenny, let's start with some warm-up exercises. [plays the sequence C E G C G E C]
Kenny
[sings along] (Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) [his mom looks on. The instructor and Kenny move on to the D and E scales.]
Mrs.McCormick
Well, what do you think? Can you help him become a better singer?
Instructor
Well, he's got potential. Depends on how good he wants to be.
Kenny
(I wanna be really good)
Instructor
Well, if you wanna be a real singer, you need to go to a conservatory in Europe. There's no other alternative.
Kenny
(Europe?)
Mrs.McCormick
We can't afford that.
Instructor
Well, then, I'm afraid your son will always be a hack.
Kenny
(Awww.)
Mrs.McCormick
Well, Kenny, if it means that much to you, maybe we can bus it to Europe and... you can sing on the way to make money.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
The Marsh house, breaking news music is heard. Sharon rushes into the kitchen
Sharon
Randy, Randy, you'd better have look at this. [exits to the living room]
Randy
[follows her out] What? [The boys and the quints watch the news. Sharon and Randy join them]
Anchor Tom
...until the U.S. government receives this video, which was sent from Romania just hours ago.
Man
[reading a statement at gunpoint] Hello. This is Romanian father. I am desperate to have my girls returned to me in Romania.
Randy
Uh-oh.
Stan
That's your dad?
Quint 2
Maybe.
Quint 1
But we haven't seen papa for more than five years.
Man
How I've missed them all. Little Nahlal.
Voice
[hits the man on the head with the gun, k'chunk] Nadia!
Man
Nadia, my sweet Barshta
Voice
[k'chunk] Baltania!
Man
Baltania, eh anyway, my heart is aching for their return. I, I know the American government will do what's right. [the TV is turned off]
Kyle
Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
Stan
[gets up and runs to his parents] Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
Sharon
Well, I... think we... have to,... don't we? [looks at Randy]
Randy
I don't know.
Kyle
[the girls look at him] You don't wanna go back to stinky Romania, do you? It sucks there.
Cartman
Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
Sharon
We'll have to call the police and see what they want us to do. [she and Randy walk away]
Cartman
Damn, we might be screwed.
Stan
No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! [walks off]
South Park Train Station. Kenny and his mom await the train. Kenny launches into "La Donna E Mobile." Mrs. McCormick holds a "Trying To Get To Europe" sign. The other boys take the quints to South Park Funland
Cartman
[in a log ride with the other seven, passes a lumberjack scene] You see, in America we have... log rides! [Kenny and his mom are at a bus terminal in Denver. A couple passes by and drops some money into the hat. Next, Cartman and friends are at Burger Cook, a fast-food restaurant] Bacon double-cheeseburgers! [Kenny and his mom are now at Coyote Bus Lines (play on Greyhound Bus Lines) in St. Louis at night. A man peeks through a door, another man drops some money into the hat. Next day] Sheep-shearing contests!
22nd Annual Sheep Shearing Contest
A man shears a sheep with a shearer as the eight kids and four adults watch
A fan
Yeah. Woo hoohoohoo. Yeah. [the girls look on expressionless then #2 and #3 look at each other skeptically. Kenny and his mom are now at JFK International Airport in New York. Kenny gets some more money]
Cartman
[showing the others around a three-story shopping mall] And shopping malls! Hooray! [the girls are grinning. Kenny finally lands in Europe and goes out through gate 96]
Welcome To Europe! Coziest LittlePlace On Earth! Elevation 4200 ft.
Kenny
(Woo hoo!)
the U.S. Capitol. The Romanian father and two Romanian officials sit in Janet Reno's office
Romanian Official
[no beard] Mrs. Janet Reno, you must understand, the father has right to his children.
Janet Reno
[flanked by two agents in riot gear] Yes, but the girls seem to wanna stay here. Why don't you all stay here in America, and this whole thing can go away.
Mr. Vladchick
Okay. [the official smacks him with the back of the hand] Heh!
Romanian Official
Our home is Romania. We love it there.
Mr. Vladchick
Ah, yes, uwuh we love it there.
Romanian Official
If daughters will not return on their own, you must force them to return
Janet Reno
Gentlemen, this has to be handled very delicately. You don't understand Americans' power to protest.
Romanian Official
Protest?
Janet Reno
Look, people have it so good in America that they get bored very easily. And when people get bored they start protesting things.
All three men
Oh.
Janet Reno
But I want to assure you, and the Romanian people, that we are going to do everything in our power to make this as confusing as possible. [the Romanians already look confused]
South Park, the Marsh house, day. A crowd of protesters lobby in front of the house with signs like "No Go!", "We (heart) The Quints" and "Romania (with red cross-out circle stamp)".
Protesters
Let the quints stay! Romania is gay! Let the quints stay! Romania is gay!
Stephen Stotch
Fur is murder! Fur is murder! [notices the stares] Oh, what are we protesting here?
A Protester
[with a "No Romania" sign] Romania sucks!
Stephen Stotch
Oh, let's see [His professional protest sign has multiple pages and he flips through from "FUR IS MURDER" to "FREE KEVORKIAN," "SLEEPING BAGS KILL," then "ROMANIA SUCKS"] Here we go. Romania sucks!
Protesters
Romania sucks! Romania sucks!
Sharon
[looks out through the window. "Romania sucks! Romania sucks! Romania sucks!"] Oh my God! I didn't know this was going to become such a big deal.
Randy
["Romania sucks!"] That'll teach us for taking an old lady and her granddaughters out of the cold.
Lead Agent Collins
[backed by 11 other agents and a humvee] Attention, people inside the house! [Randy and Sharon look] You must return the quintuplets to their father! You have until... [lowers the bullhorn. An agent comes up and whispers] Oh yeah, that's good. [back on the bullhorn] You have until Easter Sunday to comply.
Protester
Nooo!
Protesters
Boooo!
Collins
What?! [the protesters gang up on the agents, beating them with their signs]
The Marsh house, Stan's room. Stan and friends are oblivious to the action outside
Stan
Okay, let's try it again. Hup!
A Quint
Hup! [she leaps into position to complete the arch. Kyle and Cartman dive through and get up]
Kyle
Alright!
Randy
[enters] Stan, we- [the sight of the undressed boys stops him]
Sharon
Stanley, we have some bad news. The courts have decided the girls must go back to Romania.
Stan
No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
Kyle
Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
Randy
I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. [he and Sharon walk away]
Stan
Now what do we do?
The Marsh house, outside, day. Several days have passed, and now the protest crowd is larger, and news cameras are present
Reporter
Tom, it is now Easter morning, and as the U.S. government promised, they are here to take the girls back to their father in Romania. Rumor has it that Janet Reno herself will be extraditing the quintuplets. [just then, a helicopter flies in and hovers over the house. Janet Reno, dressed in a bunny suit, waits in the open door to be lowered]
Soldier
Alright, Ms. Reno, let's go over the plan.
Janet Reno
Right.
Soldier
We'll drop you on the northwest corner of the backyard. You hop into the back of the house and find the quintuplets. When you see them, you say...
Janet Reno
"Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny."
Soldier
Good. And then hand them the Easter eggs filled with tear gas. Are you ready?
Janet Reno
Ready.
Soldier
Code blue!
Janet Reno
Code blue! [drops down onto the yard]
Romanian School of Music, day. Kenny is heard singing. He is onstage as his song ends, and his mom joins him with three other people
Music Instructor
Lad, we would like very much to have you here at the Romanian Music School.
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Mrs. McCormick
How much is all this gonna cost?
Music Instructor
Don't worry, Ms. McCormick, Romania is very poor country. Apartment is cheap. Food is cheap, Everything is cheap because we are so God-damned poor.
Assistant
Yes, your two hundred American dollars will last months here.
Mrs. McCormick
Wow, what a great country. Everybody's poor, like us.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
The Marsh house, day. Protesters and police mill around the front yard
Janet Reno
[enters the kitchen through the back door] Hello, girls. I'm the Easter bunny. [sees nothing but furniture before her. She pulls out a an assault rifle with scope and silencer then moves forth] Happy Easter, kids. Come see what I brought for ya. [Stan, his parents, and the quints watch TV in the living room, and Janet Reno peeks at them. Terrance and Phillip are heard on the TV. Janet Reno pulls back and flattens herself against the kitchen wall]
Phillip
Hey, Terrance, I think I have to fart. [Reno pulls out an Easter egg and throws it at the girls. It ends up right in front of them]
Terrance
Wait. Before you do, pull my thumb.
Quint 2
Oh, look. An Easter egg.
Randy
Oh, shi- [the Easter egg unleashes its tear gas, and all cough and choke]
Lead Soldier
That's it. Let's move, move move move, move! [breaks through the front door and leads the other police officers in.] Give us the kids, now! Now!
Officer 1
Down on the floor. Get down on the God-damned floor! [more officers stream in as Sharon drops down to the floor and assumes the fetal position]
Officer 2
Find them!
Janet Reno
[bursts through the master bedroom door] This is a bust! Hand over the quints! [police officers are already there looking for them under the bed and in dresser drawers. Reno joins them and heads for the closet. She opens a sliding door and finds Randy holding Stan in his arms and points her weapon at them thus comically recreating the famous image of the US Border Patrol agent pointing his MP5 submachine gun at six year old Elian Gonzalez held by his rescuer Donato Dalrymple] Hand over the children! Happy Easter. Hand over the children!!
Grandpa
[rolls in] What the hell's goin' on?! [all guns point to him]
Officer 3
Freeze, asshole!
Grandpa
Aw, go ahead and shoot me! I dare ya!
Officer 3
Don't push me, man!
Grandpa
Pull the trigger, you little pussy!
Officer 3
Gaahhh! [aims away from Grandpa and lets loose with gunfire]
Officer 4
Gun! Gun! [fires into the room. Reno drops down to avoid getting hit. Bullets riddle the wall]
Janet Reno
Down! Down! [outside, the protesters back away from the house]
Protester
Riot! Riot! [protesters now move forward against a wall of police]
Officer 5
Pepper spray! Pepper spray! [the police harden their line, pull out their cans and spray the protesters, who drop down immediately coughing. The house blows up. When the smoke clears, Reno and two officers are seen carrying the quints away. They reach a black van and toss the girls inside.]
Officer 6
Go ahead! In the van! [Reno goes in, followed by the other officers. One of them barks an order to the driver, and the van leaves the scene.]
Stan
[standing in front of the still burning ruins of his house] Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
Romanian School of Music, day. Kenny performs in front of a full house. He finishes his song and the audience erupts in applause. Roses rain down upon him as he takes his bow.
Music Instructor
Oh, your son is so talented, Ms. McCormick. The people of Romania love him.
Mrs. McCormick
Good job, Kenny.
Music Instructor
Mrs. McCormick, we would love for you and your son to stay here in Romania, with us. Will you consider it?
Mrs. McCormick
[She kneels down and places her hand on Kenny's head] Well, what do you think, Kenny? You'd have to leave your friends and your family behind.
Kenny
(Sure!)
Music Instructor
Alright!
The Marsh house, day. The protesters leave one by one. The Marshes stand in the bombed-out ruins
Sharon
Oh, Randy, it's gone! It's all gone!
Cartman
[arrives with Kyle] Dude, what the hell happened?
Stan
The government came and got the quintuplets. No more Cirque du Cheville for us.
Kyle
Damnit! How come every time we get a sweet idea, the government has to screw it up?!
Stan
Yeah! Well, not this time!
Cartman
Huh?
Stan
We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side! [addresses the mob] Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
Protester 1
Hmm.
Protester 2
Yeaahh.
Protester 3
I don't know. I usually like to stop protesting by 5:30.
Protester 4
Yeah, ah, do we get overtime for this?
Stan
Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.
Protester 5
Alright! [Fist pumps]
Protester 6
Yeah!
Protester 7
Down with Japan! [the mob moves away]
An office. Janet Reno and the two officers meet the Mayor and her aides for a photo-op. The photographer takes his shot.
Janet Reno
Alright. We just need to get a few more pictures of the girls reunited with their father so everyone knows they're happy. [The girls are shown with their grinning father. Two of them sit on his laps, the other three stand in front]
Photographer
Come on, girls. Smile. [the girls look downcast] We want you to look happy. Smile. [works a sock puppet on his left hand] Look at the silly frog. Who's got the silly frog? Look at him. I've got- Look at him. It's so silly. "I'm so silly." [the girls still have their eyes cast down]
Romania, day. A news report on TV
Stuart
Ah, hello? This is Kenny's dad, back in America. I miss my son very much. I would like to see him returned to me so that the U.S. government will buy me a new car and- [the butt of a rifle strikes the side of his head] Ow! I mean, bec- because I miss my son very much. [looks to his right] Man.
A United States Air Force checkpoint, later. Cartman, Kyle, and Stan approach, and a soldier intervenes
Stan
Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
Soldier
[Holds out hand to stop their progress] You can't see them, boys. They're happily reunited with their father.
Stan
[whistles a signal] Come on, angry mob! [the mob appears behind him. All of them move forward and overrun the checkpoint. A lagging protester runs over a fallen soldier]
Soldier
Aaa-a-a-aaa-ah.
The USAF office. Reno has taken her mask off and stands next to the girls. Behind her are six officers, and next to them are the two Romanian officials and Mr. Vladchick.
Romanian Official
[the bearded one] Alright, it is time for us to return to Romania.
Janet Reno
[hears something] What is that?
Officer 7
[at a window] It's the protesters. They're back.
Janet Reno
God-damnit! [Puts back on her Easter Bunny 'helmet'] We'll take care of them. Come on! [leaves the office]
Officer 8
Let's move. Move!
Officer 7
Come on, come on, come on.
Officer 9
Come oonn, come oonn. [they follow Reno out, leaving the quints alone in front of a poster that reads "Join the Army... It's KILLER!!!". The officers engage the protesters on a runway]
Officer 10
This is government property!
Protester
Let the quints stay! [Reno and Sharon head for each other]
Sharon
You ruined my house! [lays out Reno using a baseball bat to the Bunny helmet. The quints look out the window, then turn around. Quint 2 hops off the bench and walks to the office phone]
Quint 1
What are you doing, Nadia?
Nadia
I'm calling the only person in the vorld who can help us. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing. The other girls look at each other.]
A USAF airfield, later. Protesters and officers are still brawling. Stan and Kyle each kick an officer on the shin.
Cartman
Take that! [kicks an officer on the shin]
Quint 3
[heads towards the battlefield and addresses everyone] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! [the other four quints are with her. Weapons and signs are lowered]
Quint 1
All of you are acting like idiots!
Stan
Yeah.
Quint 1
None of you care about us. You only care about yourselves!
Quint 2
Look at you, Father. You walked out on us five years ago [he removes his hat and holds it tight], and now you act like you miss us sooo much! You are a liar and a fake!
Cartman
Yeah, you suck, dude!
Quint 3
And you Romanian leaders [both of them are there], you don't care about us! All you care about is making America look stupid!
Cartman
Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!
Quint 3
And you protesters! Don't you have anything better to do?! Get a life!
Cartman
Yeah!
Quint 3
And you boys are the worst of all!
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
Huh?
Quint 3
You know nothing about Romania, and yet you assume America is so much better! Maybe Romania isn't as nice as America, but it is our home! We are Romanian! All you care about is your own stupid circus! [at this point, a limousine pulls up behind them. It's from the Oprah show. The driver opens the back door and the girls head for the back seat]
Janet Reno
[has a protester in a headlock] Where are you going, girls?
Quint 1
The only place we can go. We're going on Oprah and then a book tour. [turns and climbs in, followed by three others]
Quint 5
Yes. You can all kiss our little white Romanian asses! [wiggles her ass at the crowd and climbs in. The limo leaves and everyone is left in a state of shock.]
Stan
Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
Cartman
Yeah, screw them!
Kyle
Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
Stan
Whatever happened to Kenny?
Romania, still grey and dismal daytime. Romanian protesters with signs bearing a picture of Kenny's head lobby in front of the house Kenny's in.
Romanian Protesters
Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! Let Kenny stay! [a van pulls up and police officers all the way from the U.S. pour out]
Officer 1
[sternly] Alright, people, the father wants his son returned to him! Hand him over to us!
Romanian Protesters
Boooo!
Officer 2
Shut up, Romanians! All right, let's go. Move move move move! [bursts through the front door. Officers pour in and look all over the place for Kenny. They enter the master bedroom, and look under the bed and in dresser drawers. One of them head for the closet and opens the sliding door and again the Elian Gonzalez scene is recreated with Kenny and his mother facing the police]
Officer 3
[seeing Mrs. McCormick holding Kenny] Hand over the boy, now!
Mrs. McCormick
Okay, okay!
Officer 3
I mean it, lady, you've got about-! [his assault rifle goes off, riddling Kenny with bullets. His mom is distraught and drops Kenny] Whoops.
End of Quintuplets 2000

Cartman Joins NAMBLA
Kenny's house, day. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny sit around a Monopoly-type board game in Kenny's room
Cartman
Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card! [tosses it in front of him] You can deny it, or cover it up.
Stan
Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
Cartman
[Front of board game box is seen with 'Kurtis' spelled incorrectly with a 'C'] It's "Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.
Stan
Um, deny it?
Cartman
Okay, let's see what Bill Kurtis says. [presses an electronic Bill Kurtis head]
Electronic Head
[trembles from side to side] Hello, I'm Bill Kurtis. Many believe that the U.S. Government... covered it up. I'm Bill Kurtis.
Kyle
Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card. [tosses it in front of him] You lose a turn.
Stan
Sweet.
Cartman
Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! [tosses the card in front of him]
Kyle
What?
Cartman
I just gave you AIDS.
Kyle
AIDS?! [looks confused]
Stan
Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
Cartman
Kyle has AIDS, and now loses 47 turns [Kyle turns angry] and 800 points. [camera pans back, and Kenny's parents appear at the door with arms around each other]
Mrs. McCormick
Kenny, your dad and I are thinking about having another baby. Wouldn't you like to have another brother or sister?
Kenny
(No.)
Stuart
[tickling his wife] We just might get workin' on it later tonight, huh huh huh. [they walk off giggling]
Cartman
God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
Stan
You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
Cartman
...You see. [stands] Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here [hovers his right hand at eye level], and all my friends are down here [hovers it at stomach level].
Kyle
You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
Cartman
Nononono! Me h'myah [hand at eye level], you guys myah! [hand at chest level] — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah. [hand at foot level. Then he straightens up] SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. [turns around, walks out, and towards the front door.]
Electronic Head
I'm Bill Kurtis.
Cartman's house, a few minutes later. Cartman paces the floor in his room. Next to him is a computer
Cartman
I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog. [looks at Clyde Frog for a few seconds, then] Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog! [walks over to the chair and hops on] I can meet new friends on the Internet! [clicks the mouse and presses a few keys, then the computer chimes. A list of chat rooms comes up] Here's a chat room: "Men Who Like Young Boys" [moves the cursor to the title and clicks on it] That's perfect. [starts typing] Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li- [replies start cascading over his message] Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316. [click on Tony's reply and starts typing] Hi Tony. [clicks and reads the reply] "So what are you into?" [replies] Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face. [clicks and reads the reply] "Kewl. Wanna get together? [softer] Smiley-face?" [replies] Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face. [clicks and reads the reply] "Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning." [replies] Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face. [clicks, then brightly] You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
Mel's Buffet, next day. Cartman enters and approaches a man seated alone in a booth.
Cartman
Hi, are you Tony? [the man looks unusually friendly]
Tony
Yeah. You're -Eric?
Cartman
Yeah! [gets into the booth and sits next to Tony]
Tony
[meekly, hands a bag to Cartman] I brought you some candy.
Cartman
[takes the bag] Wow, cool!
Tony
[hands him two books] And some books on Kama Sutra.
Cartman
Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends [Tony places his hand on Cartman's back and starts rubbing with an open smile]; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
Tony
Yahahahah like having your back rubbed?
Cartman
Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. [two agents burst through the main door and head for Tony and Cartman]
Agent
Hold it right there, scumbag!
Tony
[Quickly removes hands from Cartman] Huh?
Cartman
Huh?
Agent
[pulls out some handcuffs] We monitored your little online chat. [cuffs Tony] Now you're coming with us! [hauls him away]
Tony
[meekly] No! [the two agents whisk him outside]
Cartman
[concerned] What the hell just happened?
Kenny's house, early morn. Kenny's tossing in bed, apparently in a nightmare. His dreams are shown, and in each a parent carries a baby
Mom
You can't eat, Kenny. We have to save food for the baby.
Dad
Your mom and I are going out for a few weeks, Kenny. Take care of the baby.
Mom
Kenny, you have to change the baby's diapers!
Dad
You have to share your room with the baby!
Mom
The baby.
Dad
The baby!
Mom
The baby!!
Kenny
[wakes and sits up] (HAAAAAAAAGH!) [looks around]
Kenny's house, living room sofa, later. Stuart is tickling his wife again
Mrs. McCormick
[giggles] Stop it!
Stuart
Come on, let's go try to get you pregnant again.
Mrs. McCormick
Oh, alright. [they get up and move when Kenny arrives with glove and baseball]
Kenny
(Dad, I wanna play catch.)
Stuart
Huh? Uh, I'll play catch with your later, son.
Kenny
(But I wanna play now!)
Mrs. McCormick
Oh, go ahead. We can make love afterwards.
Stuart
Aw, alright.
Kenny's house, front lawn. Kenny stands in the driveway and Stuart stands in front of the tattered sofa
Stuart
Well alright, here comes a pop fly. See if you can catch it! [tosses it high, but straight for Kenny's glove. Kenny catches it] Good job. Now throw me one. [Kenny takes the ball out of the glove, looks at it in anger, and shoots it straight for his father's groin. Stuart doubles over in pain and covers his crotch] Ohp! Guhhogh! [groaning, he ends up on his side, then throws up]
Mrs. McCormick
[opens the door and rushes out] What happened?!
Stuart
Aw, he smacked me in the balls! [groans some more. Kenny tosses the glove to his mother]
Kenny
[goes inside] (Woohoo!) [Stuart groans some more, then vomits]
Cartman's house, day. He's back at the computer in his room
Cartman
Okay, we'll try this again. [starts typing as BigBoned] Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to- [More quickly than before, his screen fills with cascading replies. He picks one] Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy. [starts typing] Hello, HungDaddy. [reads the reply] "Hi. I'm eight and a half inches." Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf. [Says out loud:] Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets. [Types and says:] Midgets piss me off. Frowny face. [clicks and moves on] Lemme see, how about this one?
The South Park docks, day. Cartman walks towards the end, where a man in trench coat and baseball cap looks out over the water.
Cartman
[draws close to the man] Mister Hammerhead?
Mr. Hammerhead
[turns around and is instantly recognizable] Hi there.
Cartman
Mr. Garrison??
Mr. Garrison
[startled] Haah! Eric!
Cartman
You wanna be my friend?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, crap!
Cartman
That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
Mr. Garrison
Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing! [four agents appear and head for him]
Agent
Alright, scumbag, we got you!
Mr. Garrison
[voice quivering] Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me.
Agent
Nice try, buddy! We monitored your little online chat—now, you're coming with us! [the four agents, two on either side of Garrison, take him away]
Mr. Garrison
No-o!
Cartman
Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
South Park Clinic, day. Stan and Kyle stand before a picture window.
Kyle
See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines. [elderly people are seen hooked up to them] Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
Stan
Oh, man, that's terrible.
Kyle
I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this. [plants his lips wide on the glass and blows out] Waaaaah! [as the seal takes hold, his cheeks puff up and the inside of his his mouth shows clearly — it is a blow face. Stan smiles]
Stan
Haha, he-yeah ha. [makes his own blow face] Haaaaah.
Kyle
[makes the blow face and wags his tongue at the patients] Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
Stan
[does the same] Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
Cartman
[walks up] Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
Stan
[looks and then faces him. Kyle follows] We're making faces at sick people.
Cartman
No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being "mys-teriously" arrested, huh?! [Stan and Kyle are confused and look at each other]
Stan
We don't know.
Cartman
I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
Kyle
We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
Cartman
Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
Stan
You're not more mature than us, Cartman!
Cartman
YES I AM!! [Stan and Kyle back up a bit. Cartman turns and walks away]
South Park Police Department, day. Mr. Garrison and Tony are in the cell, and Officer Barbrady sits at a desk with his feet up
Mr. Garrison
I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
Well, the FBI said I have to hold you here, so that's what I'm gonna do, Mr. Complainy Pants.
Mr. Garrison
O-ogh! [returns to the bed and sits]
Tony
Do you like having your back rubbed?
Mr. Garrison
Eat me, pervert!
Tony
Okay. [some commotion is heard outside. A group of men is seen approaching and the front door opens. The men walk in and approach the desk]
Man
We demand you release these men at once!
Officer Barbrady
Who are you?
Man
We are NAMBLA, the North American Man Boy Love Association, and we heard about these political prisoners you're keeping?
Officer Barbrady
Political prisoners? No, these are child molesters.
Man
Loving young boys has been around since the time of the Romans, pal! There's nothing wrong with it! We are an organization dedicated to showing that sex between a man and a young boy can be a beautiful thing!
Other NAMBLA Men
[ad lib] Yeah, uh-huh.
Officer Barbrady
[stands up] Uuuh, I don't know who you are, but these men aren't going anywhere until I hear from the FBI.
Man
Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
Other NAMBLA Men
Hate mongerer! Hate mongerer!
Officer Barbrady
Okay people [the men fall silent], I think you'd better move along before I arrest more of you!
Man
All these men wanted was to love a young boy! [pounds the table a few times] There is nothing wrong with love!
Mr. Garrison
I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age. [gasps and shrieks] Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!
Man
You haven't heard the last of us, officer! Together we are strong. [turns and heads for the door] Come on, men! [the others follow him out, chattering]
Officer Barbrady
[sits back down and plops his feet up] Wow, they've got activists for everything these days.
South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch, night with eery lightning overhead and thunder heard. Dr. Mephesto and Kevin are at a lab table
Dr. Mephesto
I've done it, Kevin. I've successfully spliced this chipmunk with a piece of provolone cheese. [the "cheesemunk"in the box groans] Do you know what this means, Kevin? No more will the world have to look in two different places for squirrels and provolone cheese. No more will mankind have to pick- [the doorbell rings] Who could that be? [walks over and opens the door] Why, it's little Eric Cartman.
Cartman
Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
Dr. Mephesto
Well of course, come in.
Cartman
[follows Mephesto and Kevin in] You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
Dr. Mephesto
[stops and faces him] Oh, Eric, I'm afraid it's not that simple. Genetic engineering has not yet evolved to the state where I can just make people.
Cartman
Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
Dr. Mephesto
Oh. Well, I happen to be a member of an organization that can help you. It's called, NAMBLA.
Cartman
NAMBLA?
Dr. Mephesto
Yes. I have been a member for several years. I'm sure they'd let you join. You l-look about right.
Cartman
Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! [turns and walks out]
Dr. Mephesto
Sure!
South Park Inn. "No Vacancy" "Welcome NAMBLA." Inside, the NAMBLA leader speaks to the group in a meeting room. On either side of him are portraits of men with boys on their laps. More picture line the walls
Man
[henceforth, NAMBLA leader] Fellow members of NAMBLA. As you know, hn hn, we continue to be discriminated against. Recently, the FBI has started to arrest men, who are doing nothing more than trying to start a sexual relationship with a young boy.
Members
Awwww.
NAMBLA leader
And now that all ethnic groups, homosexuals and women's are protected under civil-rights laws, [pounds on the podium] we want the same!
Members
[weakly] Yeah.
Eager Man
Yeh-hehah-hah.
NAMBLA leader
What we need is proof that young boys want to be members of NAMBLA. That they want love from us. We need a poster child, to show the world that it is a beautiful and wonderful thing and a- [Cartman enters and takes a seat. Men in the back row look on with some awe.] Can we... help you?
Cartman
Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
NAMBLA leader
You... do?
Cartman
Sure.
NAMBLA leader
[greatly relieved] Oho, thank you. Thank you, Jesus.
Cartman
[looks around] ...Sweet.
South Park Clinic, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny stand before the picture window. Stan and Kyle make blow faces again. The patients are dismayed. Kenny soon tries to make a blow face but his ever present hood is still on. His parents walk up
Mrs. McCormick
Well, Kenny, the doctor confirmed it. I'm pregnant! You're gonna have a little brother or sister.
Kenny
(No!!) [the camera zooms in on him]
Mrs. McCormick
Yup, it's for sure!
Stuart
And he fixed my shattered left testicle, too!
Mrs. McCormick
Don't be out too late, Kenny. We need to start movin' stuff out of your room. [the parents walk away]
Kyle
Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.
Stan
Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
Kenny
(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) [turns around and walks away in his parents' direction]
Cartman
[rushes up from the other direction] Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I got into NAMBLA and you gu-uys didn't!
Kyle
What are you talking about, fatass?
Cartman
Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! [turns and walks away]
South Park Pharmacy, day. Inside, Kenny in his normal outfit, but with a blond wig, approaches the counter.
Pharmacist
Can I help you, young lady?
Kenny
[wearing a blonde wig] (Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)
Pharmacist
Oh, you want some morning-after abortion pills. Well, they're right over there. [points to them. Kenny looks]
Kenny
(Thanks.) [walks over and looks at them. He sees "Morning After Abortion Pills," "Baby - B- Gone," "Get it outta me! (has an unknown, real woman's face pictured)" "Fetus Flusher" "Pregnant No More Super Size." He takes the "Pregnant No More" pills to the counter]
Pharmacist
Uh, I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't sell that to you without permission from your parents. [Kenny hands him a note that reads: I hereby give my daughter permission to abort her baby -Mother] Oh, well, alrighty then. Cash or charge?
Kenny
(Cash.)
Kenny's house, day. Kenny's in the kitchen mixing a drink. It consists of cocoa, vodka, ...and the entire bottle of "Pregnant No More" pills. All 999 of them. In a mug. He finishes, drops down, and heads for the living room
Kenny's house, living room. Stuart reads the paper, and Mrs.McCormick is knitting. Kenny enters with the mug
Kenny
(Look, Mom. I made you something to drink.) [a rat climbs onto the sofa headrest; Stuart shoos it away]
Mrs. McCormick
Oh, well that's very sweet of you, Kenny. You made my favorite drink for me.
Kenny
(Yeah.) [presents the mug]
Mrs. McCormick
But unfortunately, now that I'm pregnant, I can't drink.
Kenny
(What?)
Stuart
Well, I can still drink. [grabs the mug and starts chugging away]
Kenny
(No! Daddy!) [looks on as Stuart finishes the mug off]
Stuart
Ogh, that hits the spot. Makes me forget all about my shattered balls. [seeing Kenny looking at him] What? Wwhat's the matter? Uh, why don't you go make me another one of... of... [his stomach starts to churn, and he holds it] Who-o-oa.
Mrs. McCormick
What's the matter?
Kenny
(Uh oh.)
Stuart
Oh, God, I'm gonna crap my pants! [rushes to the bathroom]
Kenny's house, bathroom. A sign saying "CRAPPER SWEET CRAPPER" hangs on the wall. Stuart drops his pants and briefs, hops on the toilet, and starts crapping
Stuart
Oohhh, God! [farts and craps in pain] Oooh, my balls! [Kenny appears at the door. Stuart turns around and vomits into the toilet. He alternates between crapping and vomiting, farting all the while] Ooh, God [more alternating between pooping and vomiting as Kenny just stares]
Photo-Dojo, day. Members of NAMBLA surround the photographer as he takes pictures.
NAMBLA Member
Just a few more pictures, Eric. You make a perfect poster child.
Cartman
Thanks, dude. [poses in his beefcake swim pants for several shots before a curtain that says "I LOVE NAMBLA"]
NAMBLA leader
[arrives with some other members] Uh hey, Eric, we have a surprise for you. We want to have a big dinner and dance honoring you as our new poster child.
Cartman
Really? Awesome![continues to pose in various ways as camera shutter sounds are heard]
NAMBLA leader
Yes, and we you to um... invite all your young male friends. [the guys behind him start to drool]
Cartman
Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature, [looks back at the camera and mumbles] excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
NAMBLA leader
Great, hnn. You go invite your little friends, and we'll get the hotel ready.
Cartman
KIIICK ASS!
Kenny's house, day. Kenny's on the sofa watching television.
Mrs. McCormick
[off-screen] Kenny?? Don't forget to clean out your room so we can paint it for the baby. [Kenny hops off as one commercial ends. Another one draws his attention.]
Announcer
[echo on] Hey, are you feeling down? You need some excitement. And North Park Funland has just opened its newest ride! The John Denver Experience! [the ride is demonstrated] You'll be Rocky Mountain High with this, the most EXTREME, INSANE RIDE EVER BUILT.
Two Guys
["ACTUAL TESTIMONIAL"] It was-
Guy 1
[holds up right thumb] -fun.
Guy 2
[holds up left thumb] -fun.
Announcer
Note: people with heart conditions and expectant mothers should not ride the JOHN DENVER! Open now! Come on down!
Kenny
(Mom!) [walks away]
North Park Funland, day. People file in. The McCormicks are in line to go on the John Denver Experience
Stuart
Are you sure you should be going on this thing?
Mrs. McCormick
Oh, it's all right. [in a low voice] You know, I think maybe Kenny's been a little worried about the new baby. We have to show him that he's still our little boy. [the line moves forward. Kenny and his parents find seats in the first row. The ride itself is wrapped in the body of a small plane, with a wing serving as a ramp]
Operator
[speaks into a muffled PA system] Folks, please keep your hands and arms inside the John Denver Experience at all times. There's no sense in trying to unloop at the latch at any time during the ride at the John Denver Experience. Have fun.
Stuart
What did he say? [the ride swings up smoothly, but at the top it swings into high gear, slamming into the platform during one swing, into a building during another swing, and back and forth this way a few times. Mrs. McCormick is enjoying it quite a bit. The ride ends with a slam into a large pool, where the plane rests upside down] ...John Denver Experience.
North Park Funland, John Denver Experience exit. Riders exit. The McCormicks are the last ones out
Stuart
Oh, God, my nose! I think I broke my nose!
Mrs. McCormick
Come on, Stuart, let's just get you to a bathroom.
Stuart
Oh, I'm not gonna make it! I'm gonna be sick! [heads for the nearest trash can and vomits into it. A woman carrying her baby moves away. He grabs his stomach] Oh, my stomach! [pulls down his pants and poops in the trash can] Oh, my nose! [sneezes blood into the trash can] Gross! [vomits, poops, and sneezes, and this goes on for quite a while. Kenny simply slaps his hand to his head and rolls his eyes.]
South Park, day. Cartman runs into the boys in front of the South Park Clinic
Cartman
Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
Kyle
They are?
Cartman
We're gonna have a big, mature party at this hotel, and I can invite all my mature friends that I want. And that means I'm gonna invite everybody! Except for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah!
Stan
[angry] We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
Cartman
Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
Kyle
We don't wanna go!
Cartman
You can't go.
Kyle
We don't WANNA go!
Cartman
No, you CAN'T go. [turns around and walks away] Hey, Clyde, Butters, check this out
Stan
Dude, maybe we do need to start being more mature.
Kyle
Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
Kenny's house, day. He is asleep again in his room. Another nightmare appears. The scene is a delivery room at Hell's Pass Hospital. Kenny's mom is about to give birth, and Dr. Doctor is there with a nurse and Stuart
Dr. Doctor
You're doing fine, Ms. McCormick. [sees Kenny sneaking a peek] It's alright, Kenny. Come see the miracle of life. [Kenny approaches and is covered in amniotic fluid as his mom's water bursts]
Kenny
(Eeww.)
Dr. Doctor
I can see its head!
Ms. McCormick
You can?
Dr. Doctor
Push, now. Push hard! [Ms.McCormick holds onto Stuart's hand hard and pushes the baby out. The doctor shields his face] Oh my God. [the nurse screams in horror]
Ms. McCormick
What is it?? [the baby is shown; it is a mutant with long claws and a nasty disposition]
Dr. Doctor
[turns to run] It's ali- [the mutant baby decapitates Dr. Doctor, the nurse, and Kenny]
Stuart
Oh my God, it killed Kenny!
Ms.McCormick
Bad baby, bad!
Kenny
[sits up awake] (Huh. Huh??) [looks around and realizes he's awake] (That does it!) [jumps off, goes to the bathroom and gets a plunger. Then he leaves the restroom]
Kenny's house, living room. Mrs. McCormick is reading a book when Kenny enters with he plunger
Mrs. McCormick
[lowers the book] Oh, hi Kenny. What are ya doin'? [he lifts the plunger and aims it at her] Uh what are you doing, Kenny? [he fixes his gaze on her] Kenny, what are you going to plunge?
Kenny
[rushes at her with the plunger] (AAAARRRRHHH!)
Mrs. McCormick
Aaaaaaah! [jumps off the sofa and runs away] AAAAA! [Stuart arrives as Kenny pursues his mom]
Stuart
Kenny, what the hell are you doing?! [follows them out]
South Park Inn, day. Schmaltzy music plays as the camera looks at a large sign that says "I LOVE NAMBLA HONORARY DINNER" and has a picture of Eric posing under a spotlight at its center. Present in the ballroom are Cartman, Butters, several other boys, and the men they've partnered up with. The doors open and in walk Stan and Kyle, with their partners.
Cartman
[sees them] What the hell? [hops off his chair and walks towards them] Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
Stan
We got invited too, fatass!
Cartman
Hunh. [rolls his eyes] Well, I guess nowadays, they allow any old schmucks into NAMBLA.
NAMBLA Leader
[now at the podium, a little giddy] Fellow NAMBLA members, it is great to see you all here. It seems like we have finally found a city that won't oppress us.
NAMBLA Membe
Oh, yeah. [others cheer]
NAMBLA Leader
First and foremost, I wanna recognize Eric Cartman, for putting us in touch with all of you pretty, young boys.
Cartman
[graciously, amid some applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [takes a bow] Thank you.
NAMBLA Leader
Now, I know that many of us have already found partners in this fahine city, and I'd like to take a minute to hear some testimonials from members.
Stan
This is boring.
Kyle
Yeah. [yells] HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
Member 1
Ho hohohoho
Member 2
Woohoohoohoohoo. [others react similarly, lustily]
NAMBLA Leader
[barely containing his glee] Ho, goodness! What a gift from God! Aha ha, we'll... "get" ...to it very soon, I assure you. But first, I'd just like to hear from a couple of you on your progress. Uh yes, Patrick.
Patrick
Uh I, I found a little eight-year-old named Buttehers. He's a beautiful [Butters lights up], bright, little boy.
Butters
Well, uh I sure am, I guess.
Patrick
And his skin is as soft as fresh linen. [the other men savor the statement]
Stan
[to Kyle] That seems kind of... weird.
Butters
Well, my skin is ssspringtime sssoft, I suppose.
NAMBLA Leader
Wonderful, heh hn. And how about you, Mr. Harris?
Mr. Harris
[with a stammer] Well, I want to announce that I may have found the dream boy of the decade. He's sexy, sassy, and full of spunk. His name is Timmy.
Timmy
TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?
NAMBLA Leader
Wuhell, members, I know we're all eager to get acquainted with our new partners and, so why don't we turn down the lights and start to dance! [the DJ starts the music again, and the boys and their partners take the dance floor. Stan and Kyle stay in their seats, as do Cartman and his partner.]
South Park Elementary, 8:05 p.m., Cafeteria. The main doors are closed as the FBI shows up in force.
Lead Agent
Alright, I want those perverted bastards all taken in. Got it?
Agents
Got it!
South Park Elementary, 8:05 p.m., Cafeteria. Inside, Mephesto holds court on the podium in front of a NAMBLA banner, but this NAMBLA is different...
Mephesto
[Kevin at his side] Hello, NAMBLA members. As the South Park representative- [the doors fly open and the FBI agents fill the room]
Lead Agent
[heading for Mephesto] Hold it right there!
Agent 1
Freeze!
Agent 2
Don't nobody move!
Mephesto
What's going on? [four rifles and a shotgun are pointed at him]
Lead Agent
Alright, sickos. Where are the children?! [the NAMBLA members look at each other confused]
Mephesto
What children?
Lead Agent
This... is... NAMBLA, right?
Mephesto
Yes.
Lead Agent
The North American Man/Boy Love Association?
Mephesto
[startled] What? No! [Points to the banner behind him] We're the North American Marlon Brando Look-Alikes. [a shot of the members is shown, and many of them do look like Marlon Brando]
Blond Agent
Aw, crap! We got the wrong NAMBLA.
Mr. Garrison
Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place. [gets up and walks out]
Mephesto
Don't tell me that that other NAMBLA is actually in South Park?!
Lead Agent
You know of them?
Blond Member
Know of them? We've been fighting with them for years over the rights to nambla.com!
Brunet Member
Yeah, those perverted bastards!
Blond Agent
Wow. You guys really do look a lot like Marlon Brando.
Mephesto
Thank you. Now, let's go get those other NAMBLA bastards before they hurt any of South Park's children!
Members
Yeah! Yeah!
Black Member
And let's kick their asses for stealin' our domain name!
Members
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
South Park Inn, evening. NAMBLA members and their boys are still dancing. The NAMBLA leader steps up to the podium
NAMBLA Leader
[Cartman stands next to him] Alright, members, that's enough of that. [the music is stopped] It's time for all of us to retire to our respective rooms, and get to know our new young boys. [NAMBLA members rub their hands react lustily]
Member 3
All right.
Member 4
Alright.
Kyle
Dude. Being mature is boring!
Stan
Yeah.
NAMBLA Leader
Everyone come up and grab your room keys and we'll head upstairs, hm hm.
South Park Inn, upstairs. French music begins to play, and the men and boys appear at the top of the stairs and go to their respective rooms. After a few moments...
The Boys
Aaaaah! [all pour out into the hallway]
Stan
Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
Kyle
I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! [music resumes. All the boys turn and head for the stairs, only to see shadows moving up the wall, and they stop in their tracks]
Stan
Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! [the boys run into room 1A. Mephesto shows up and leads the other look-alikes onto the hallway]
Mephesto
Alright, Marlon Brandos, they've got to be here somewhere. Let's try this room. [they enter 2E. The FBI then arrives amid much commotion]
Lead Agent
Let's get those perverts! [the agents fan out and enter all rooms except 1A and 2E. A waiter heads for the stairs with a tray, but naked NAMBLA members pour out of their rooms and startle him. The tray flies off his hand]
Waiter
Sacrebleu! [picks up the tray and heads back to the room he left. The NAMBLA members go into 1A]
The Boys
Whoa! [pour out of 1A and head down the hall to 2E. The door there opens and the Marlon Brandos peek out]
The Boys and The Brandos
Aaah! [the boys run to 1E, the Brandos go back into 2E, and the doors to both are shut]
Mrs.McCormick
[enters the hallway from the stairs] Kenny, no! Leave me alone [heads into 1C]
Kenny
(Come here, mom! Let me get it!) [follows her in. The agents pour out of the rooms and switch places, again avoiding 1A and 2E. Stuart arrives and looks around]
Stuart
Kenny?? [enters 2C. The waiter again heads for the stairs with the tray]
Waiter
Zis time, I will not drop zeh food. [makes it to the top of the stairs, but drops the tray when the NAMBLA members exit 1A] Allo!
NAMBLA Leader
It's clear. The cops are gone. Where's the boys?! [the NAMBLA members enter 2A]
Waiter
[picks up the tray and goes back down the hall, angrily] Sacre bleu! [the door to 2E opens and the Marlon Brandos step out]
Mephesto
I think the boys went in here. [the Brandos enter 1E]
The Boys
[all exit 1E] Aaaaaah!
Timmy
Timmih! [all enter 2D. A poodle on a ball exits 1C and enters 2D. The NAMBLA members exit 2A and head for 1C]
NAMBLA Leader
Maybe the boys are in here. Oh bo-oys? [the NAMBLA members enter 1C. Kenny's mom and Kenny exit 1C]
Mrs. McCormick
Kenny, GIVE IT UP!
Kenny
(Come on!) [both enter 2C. The waiter heads for the stairs again with the tray, but Marlon Brandos and FBI agents pour out of 1E]
Waiter
[falls backwards] Waaah!
Lead Agent
Alright, you're under arrest!
Mephesto
No! You've got the wrong NAMBLA again!
Lead Agent
Damnit!
Agent
Hey, we didn't try that room! [Brandos and agents head for 2A and enter. Two guys in vintage bikes ride across from 2D to 1D]
Waiter
[exasperated, gets up with the tray] Sacre bleu. [walks away, having given up on the stairs]
South Park Inn, a room. The boys are safe, but tired
Kyle
[panting] Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
Cartman
They're all over the place.
Timmy
Timmiihhh!
Token
[Token joins the group] What are we gonna do?!
Stan
Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
The Boys
Yeah.
Cartman
Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
Kyle
How?
Cartman
Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team. [the other boys are shocked at the thought] And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. [presents him]
Butters
Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?
Cartman
Now, are you a team player or not?!
Butters
Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
Cartman
Well, Butters, there is no I in "team."
Butters
Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
Cartman
Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
Butters
Well uuh-uuh-alright then. [heads for the door. Stan sees him out and Cartman closes the door]
Cartman
Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
South Park Inn, hallway. Butters is there all alone
Butters
Well, alright men. Here, here I come. [puts his hands over his eyes and moves across the hall] I'm ready to take one for the team. [enters 1D.]
Stuart
[exits 2D] Kenny?! Kenny, I've had enough of your shenanigans! [enters 1E]
NAMBLA Leader
[inside 1E] Oh, one of the boys just came in. [the members surround him and being their activity...]
Stuart
What the-? No, wait, no, WAH, NO, WAAAAAH! [Butters steps out of 1D, listens in at the door to 1E, turns around and walks away.]
South Park Inn, outside. The inn has been cleared, so everyone stands outside. An ambulance awaits a victim, who is soon on a stretcher
Mrs. McCormick
[voice shaking, approaches] Are you alright, Stuart?
Stuart
[sobbing] Don't touch me! I've had my nuts broken, body poisoned, have been made love to in the ass by three dozen 40-year-old men—I just wanna go home and take a, a hot bath! [the NAMBLA members are in cuffs]
Lead Agent
[to NAMBLA Leader] We've been after you for a long time, buddy! Do you know your rights?
NAMBLA Leader
Rights? Does anybody know their rights? You see, I've learned something today. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Our forefathers came to this country because... they believed in an idea. An idea called "freedom." They wanted to live in a place where a group couldn't be prosecuted for their beliefs. Where a person can live the way he chooses to live. [Stan, Kyle, and Cartman look at each other] You see us as being perverted because we're different from you. People are afraid of us, because they don't understand. And sometimes it's easier to persecute than to understand. [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then at the NAMBLA leader]
Kyle
Dude. You have sex with children.
NAMBLA Leader
We are human. Most of us didn't even choose to be attracted to young boys. We were born that way. We can't help the way we are, and if you all can't understand that, well, then, I guess you'll just have to put us away. [shots of the agents, then the Brando look-alikes, then Stan and Kyle, who look at each other, then at the NAMBLA leader]
Kyle
[slowly, for emphasis] Dude. You have sex with children.
Stan
Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
Kyle
Seriously.
Lead Agent
Alright, that's enough. You're all going to be put away for a long time. [The agents escort the NAMBLA members away. The members groan. The boys gather around Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]
Kyle
Well, Cartman?
Cartman
Well, what?
Kyle
Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
The Boys
Yeah!
Cartman
Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
Stan
And now, do you still think that you need to hang out with older, mature friends?
Cartman
No, I guess you guys will blossom into maturity someday. Just don't take too long. [the paramedics finish putting Stuart into the ambulance and head for the cab]
Paramedic
Okay, let's roll. [the siren goes on. The ambulance goes into reverse and crushes Kenny under its rear wheels, then speeds off]
Hell's Pass Hospital, Delivery Room. Mrs. McCormick has a new baby in her arms, and Stuart looks at it with her
Nurse
[voice-over] Dr. Flores, dial 18-
Stuart
Coo, cootchy-coo, coohoohoohoo, cootchy-coo.
Mrs. McCormick
Our little angel, yes.
Stuart
Oh, he's so beautiful. I know it's been hard on both of us losing poor Kenny. But this new baby kind of reminds me of him. [a shot of the baby reveals a boy in a little orange parka with the hood tight on his face, like Kenny before him]
Mrs. McCormick
What should we name him?
Stuart
Well, seeing as though Kenny passed away, maybe we should name him ah,... Kenny.
Mrs. McCormick
Yes. Kenny's such a great name. My little Kenny, a brand-new Kenny. (The new Kenny then mumbles)
Stuart
God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened.
Mrs. McCormick
Fifty-second.
End of Cartman Joins NAMBLA

Cherokee Hair Tampons
South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Garrison's classroom. But this day, a substitute teacher enters with a bag of stuff and makes an announcement.
Mr. Wyland
Good morning, children. Mr. Garrison is away today. I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Wyland. [writes it on the chalkboard. A shot of the class reveals Kyle missing]
Cartman
[in a low voice] Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
Mr. Wyland
Now, I understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers. [Cartman points at Craig] But if we all behave and respect each other, I'm sure we can make this a fun and productive day. Let's start with roll call. Let's see, mmmmm. [runs his finger down the list] Eric Cartman?
Stan
[raises his hand] Here! [he, Kenny, and Cartman laugh heartily]
Mr. Wyland
Alright, and how about Stan Marsh?
Kenny
[raises his hand] (Here.) [he, Stan, and Cartman laugh heartily]
Wendy
It's not that funny, you guys. Jesus.
Mr. Wyland
Okay, and where iiiiss… Kenny McCormick?
Cartman
[raises his hand] Here. [he, Stan, and Kenny laugh heartily. A few seconds later his nose bleeds a white liquid all over his desk] Oh, hoho. Ow.
Stan
Dude, what the hell was that?
Cartman
Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
Stan
...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
Cartman
Huh?
Stan
You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
Cartman
Not with me, man.
Mr. Wyland
Alright. Look, why don't we skip roll call? Here's what we're gonna do today. [reaches into the bag and pulls out some glue and glitter] I've been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — Kyle Broflovski?
Stan
[drawn out] He's fakin'!
Mr. Wyland
Well, I've been told that in Mr. Garrison's absence, our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for Kyle. So I got this large piece of poster board, and we're all gonna come up and use glitter.and glue to decorate it.
The Class
Awww. [the kids leave their seats and head for the front of the class. Cartman remains in his seat]
Cartman
[drawn out] He's fakin'! [the other kids get busy decorating the card]
Mr. Wyland
Kenny, you come and decorate the get-well card, too.
Cartman
But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
Mr. Wyland
I don't care! Get down here and do it!
Butters
Hey, watch it! [Mr. Wyland looks down at the group] Hey, what are you doin'? [the kids back away to reveal Butters decorated, not the poster board. A sign hangs on him saying "Get Well Kyle"]
Stan
Now, that's a get-well card! [the others laugh. Cartman soon joins them, but his nose begins to leak that white liquid again. He covers his nostrils and continues laughing]
Denver, day. The Denver School Administration building is shown. Inside, the South Park School Board is meeting. Principal Victoria is present among the three people seated around a horseshoe-shaped table.
Chairman
Mr. Garrison, after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a... hiatus from teaching. Indefinitely.
Mr. Garrison
What??
Board Member
Frankly, your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting. [a look of disbelief comes across Mr. Garrison's face]
Chairman
Did you know that not one of your students knew who Sam Adams was?
Mr. Garrison
Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!
Chairman
...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn't even your educational record that we're most concerned about. [reviews a sheet of paper] It's your somewhat substantial police record.
Mr. Garrison
[stomps his foot down] Oh, whatever!
Principal Victoria
Mr. Garrison, last week's charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-
Mr. Garrison
That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! [points to his puppet]
Board Member
All we're saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little [does quotes with two fingers on each hand] "child molestation" thing dies down a bit.
Mr. Garrison
[rises from his chair] Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.
Chairman
We're sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice.
Mr. Garrison
[crestfallen] Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore. [approaches the chairman] I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... [pulls them out and sets them on the table]
Chairman
Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?[Grabs back his revolver]
Kyle's house, day, Kyle's room. He's in bed delirious and mumbling. His door opens and in walks Sheila with Sharon and Stan.
Sheila
Kyle, Stan and his mother came over to visit you.
Sharon
Hello, sweetie. [Stan walks over to Kyle's bed]
Stan
Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher. [Kyle mumbles once more] Kyle?
Sheila
They say it's his kidneys. Kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down.
Sharon
Well, the kids at school made you a card, Kyle. Look. [Butters walks into the room still decorated from head to toe in glitter and glue, and he carries the sign in his right hand]
Stan
Go on, Butters!
Butters
Ho, I don't wanna!
Stan
Butters, go on!
Butters
Oh, uhuh alright, then. [starts to sing]
We're so sorry you're not feeling well
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
[brings out a cane and dances]
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, "Get well soon!"
And "Please don't die on us."
[pulls a rip cord and a bunch of balloons inflate automatically around him. Kyle babbles some more]

Stan
Dude, you really are sick, huh?
Kyle
I don't know, I...
Sheila
I don't know what to do, Sharon. They wanna have him go into surgery, but they're so dangerous.
Sharon
Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.
Sheila
Really? In People?
Sharon
There's a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It's run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."
Sheila
Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.
Sharon
Why don't we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.
Sheila
Okay. I'll get our coats. [turns and walks out the door. Kyle babbles some more]
Butters
Can I go now?
South Park Elementary, Mr. Mackey's office. Craig waits outside on a bench.
Mr. Garrison
[lying down on a couch] I don't know what I'm goin' tuh do, Mackey. Teaching is all I know.
Mr. Mackey
[in a armchair] Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do.
Mr. Garrison
I've always wanted to write a novel.
Mr. Mackey
Well, there you go, m'kay?
Mr. Garrison
But I never know what to write about.
Mr. Mackey
Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?
Mr. Garrison
Besides teaching?
Mr. Mackey
Yes.
Mr. Garrison
...Poontang.
Mr. Mackey
M, m'kay
Mr. Garrison
I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.
Mr. Mackey
Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, that's it. [sits up brightly] I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!
Miss Information's New Age Shop. The sign is framed by two antlers and its entrance is a curtain of beads. In the picture window you see a pyramid with an eye on one side, a crystal ball and stand, a little elephant, and some charms. Outside, under the window, is a bed of flowers. Inside, Miss Information talks to Stan, Kyle, and their moms. Kyle looks fatigued
Miss Information
You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins.
Sheila
Toxins?
Miss Information
All the horrible food we eat—the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.
Sharon
Wow, that's amazing, Miss Information!
Sheila
You hear that, Kyle? You don't need surgery after all. [Kyle coughs]
Stan
Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?
Miss Information
What?
Stan
Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?
Sharon
Don't be a smartass, Stanley.
Miss Information
Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.
Sharon
Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. [Kyle begins to babble]
Mr. Garrison's house, night. A second-story window casts a shadow of Mr. Garrison at his laptop computer. He types and we hear the words as he says them in his mind...
Mr. Garrison
Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts Oh yeah, now this is getting good [sips some wine] Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard. [taps his chin with his left index finger. The computer screen is shown as the words are typed] His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his [pauses] penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples [music cuts off. He thinks] Uh, let's see... [taps his chin with his right index finger] Diana's nipples...[The words on the screen are shown halted at 'nipples'] [aloud] Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck. [turns his body to one side] Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat.

Kyle's house, morning. At Kyle's bedside, Sharon, Sheila, and Liane talk to each other while Stan keeps vigil. Three other mothers are there
Mrs. Tweak
Oh my, he looks terrible.
Blonde Mother
Yes, poor little dear.
Miss Information
[arrives] Good morning, everyone.
Blonde Mother
[walks up to her and brings her in] Oh, thanks for coming, Miss. Information. Kyle seems to be getting worse. [Miss Information walks to Kyle's bed as Stan watches. She raises her arms and waves them over Kyle's body]
Miss Information
Huuuuuuuuuh [lowers her arms] Oh, I don't agree. He seems much better.
Sheila
Really?
Stan
What?
Miss Information
Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter.
Sharon
Oh, that's great news! [Kyle barfs and Stan steps out of the way]
Sheila
Oh no!
Miss Information
Nono, that's good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system.
Sharon
Ooooo.
Stan
Those aren't toxins. That's the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.
Sharon
Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!
Stan
Don't be a smartass?
Miss Information
Now, don't be fooled. As Kyle's body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!
Sheila
Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.
Other mothers
[ad lib] I agree. Yeah. That's right. [Stan looks defeated]
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Dr. Doctor is in his office filling out a form
Nurse
[over an intercom] Mr. Marsh is here to see you.
Dr. Doctor
Alright, send him in. [from his desk, golf balls, a cup, and a set of golf clubs can be seen. Stan enters] Oh, Stanley.
Stan
Hi, doctor. [takes a seat]
Dr. Doctor
How can I help you?
Stan
Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
Dr. Doctor
He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine.
Stan
But I don't think it's working.
Dr. Doctor
Alright, Stanley, I'm going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die.
Stan
[overwhelmed] Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
Dr. Doctor
I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn.
Stan
...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
Dr. Doctor
That's very brave, Stan, but I've already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren't a match for kidneys. In fact, [looks at a sheet of paper] there's only one person in South Park with the same blood type as Kyle.
Stan
Who? [Dr. Doctor turns the sheet around, and Cartman's picture is on it. A close-up reveals that Cartman has AB-negative blood] Oh, shit.
Cartman's house, day. Cartman and Kenny are playing at dogfights in the air, and Kenny makes sound effects while maneuvering a yellow ship
Kenny
(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.) [crashes the ship into a soldier]
Cartman
"Coming in for attack, Captain." Pipew, pipipew [grabs for the yellow ship] Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
Kenny
(No, no.)
Cartman
Come on, Kenny, you have to give me the subspace cruiser [pulls the cruiser his way] so I can destroy the Gengrins on Crespus 5.
Kenny
[gets up as Cartman speaks] (Unngh. Stop, no! No, it's mine!) [pulls the cruiser back] (There! It's mine!) [the doorbell rings and the two boys tug at the ship in opposite directions]
Cartman
No, mine. M'yah! [the ship breaks in two, with Kenny getting the short end] Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha [his nose spurts out white fluid again] bluh oh, ha-ow! [blocks his nostrils]
Liane
[walks up] Ooh, sweetums, did you laugh too hard again?
Cartman
Yeah.
Liane
Well, some more of your little friends are here to play with you. [Stan enters with a sick Kyle in his arms]
Cartman
Okay, mom.
Liane
[genuflects and speaks softly to Cartman] And don't get too close to Kyle. He looks like he might have the AIDS. [Stan leaves Kyle and walks up to Cartman]
Cartman
What's goin' on, guys?
Stan
Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
Cartman
Oh-kay.
Stan
Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
Cartman
Uh huh.
Stan
What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
Cartman
Oh, I think I see where this is going. [Kyle moans]
Stan
His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
Cartman
Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
Stan
Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
Cartman
[sings and dances]
No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!

Stan
But you only need one, fat boy!
Cartman
'No no, no no, nono no!
Nonono, no no!

Stan
Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
Kenny
[miffed] (It's not that's fucking serious.) [Kyle coughs twice]
Cartman
Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
Stan
Oh my God!
Kyle
How much?
Cartman
I don't know. How much is your life worth to you, Kyle?
Stan
Cartman, you are so going to hell when you die!
Cartman
Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
Kenny
(Ten million dollars??)
Stan
What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
Cartman
What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Stan
Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. [they walk away]
Cartman
Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah. [they return to the floor to continue play] "Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire." Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
Miss Information's shop, next day. A line of folks wait to enter the shop while a few shoppers exit with their purchases. Inside, the shop is busy.
Man 1
Ooo, free-range aspirin!
Man 2
All-natural cell phones! [Two stoners, who appear to be Richard 'Cheech' Marin and Tommy Chong, appear at the door with boxes of stuff]
Miss Information
Oh, look everyone. These are our two resident Native Americans. Chief Running Pinto, and Carlos Ramirez. [shoppers gather around the men]
Man 3
[amid the chatter] Ooo.
Man 4
I'd like to buy some more stuff.
Man 5
Come in. Come here, guys.
Man 6
Do you have any new holistic items for sale?
Carlos Ramirez
Oohh, oh yeah. Aah... [holds up a decorated clothes hanger] Here, uh, this is a- uhh, dream...catcher.
Woman 1
Oh, a dreamcatcher. I'll buy one. [other women start ordering them]
Chief Running Pinto
[holds up an item] Yeah. And these here are Cherokee hair tampons. They're, like, tampons made with all-natural hair from the Cherokee people.
Sharon
Ooh, a tampon made from Cherokee hair—now that sounds natural.
Miss Information
Native Americans are more in tune with the earth than we are.
Chief Running Pinto
Oh yeah. We love the earth, man.
Carlos Ramirez
Oh yeah, the earth is great.
Miss Information
[walks up to Sheila] Mrs. Broflovski's son is a little sick. Perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing.
Chief Running Pinto
Oh, sure. We could do that, man. We'll give him, like, a, a brain enema, or somethin'.
Carlos Ramirez
[laughs] uh'hm, ho ho hm.
Sheila
Wonderful!
Miss Information
[takes Sheila along] Why don't you follow me over to the cash register and I'll take a deposit. [the other shoppers crowd the two men]
Man 7
D'you have anymore stuff to sell? We wanna buy more stuff.
Man 8
Yes. Much, much more stuff.
Chief Running Pinto
Sure, uh, we just gotta go back to our truck- I'm, I mean our horses and grab some more junk. [Ramirez starts to laugh] Come on. [turns to leave]
Miss Information
Good-bye, Native Americans. The spirit of Maya is with you.
Carlos Ramirez
Oh yah. You too and junk. [they head out the door and away]
Chief Running Pinto
[off-screen] That's funny, man. [Stan walks in]
Sharon
Oh hi, Stanley. Look, I'm buying you some more all-natural toothpaste.
Stan
You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
Sharon
That's right.
Stan
Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
Miss Information
Well, of course the doctor told you that, because he wants to make money. Holistic medicine is about NATURE. [to Sheila] Two-hundred and thirty-three dollars. [Sheila pays, and Miss Information rings it up]
Sheila
Everything's going to be fine, Stan. We're bringing Kyle in tomorrow to see the Native Americans personally.
Stan
Isn't it possible that these Indians don't know what they're talking about?
Sharon
You watch your mouth, Stanley! The Native Americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us!
Stan
And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
Sharon
Enough, Stanley!
Miss Information's shop, curbside. Kenny is sitting there. Stan exits the store, walks over to him, and sits down next to him. Somber music plays
Stan
Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.
Kenny
(I know.)
Stan
I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
Kenny
(Uh huh.)
Stan
I guess maybe I've always taken friends for granted, like they'd always be there. If a friend died, I don't know what I'd do. [Kenny gets mad, Stan gets resolute] Well, I'm not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die. Kenny, go round up all the kids in town who want to help Kyle! Round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 7:30! Kyle's gonna live! [walks away]
Kenny
(Rrrh!)
Mr. Garrison's house, night. He's back at his laptop. He's typing with only his left hand now, while Mr. Hat sits on his right hand
Mr. Garrison
[We hear Mr Garrison's thoughts]
Chapter 18. Diana had never slept with another woman before, but it was an erotic thought she often fantasized about. [out loud]Oh yeah, Mr. Hat. Hot lesbo scene comin' up! And as Rebecca's naked body lay before her, Diana couldn't help but feel aroused. [Words on the computer screen are seen typed] "Go on", Rebecca said softly, "Touch me." Diana leaned down slowly and brushed Rebecca's bare stomach with her fingertips... It felt good. Like a penis. A soft, but sturdy penis that felt warn to the touch. In Rebecca's mind, she suddenly felt like she was surrounded by penises. They were all around her, flopping all around and slapping her face. It was as if she were in a redwood forest of penises. [unconsciously, his right hand (Mr Hat hand) lowers down towards his crotch and is soon out of view, but the arm moves around some...] They presented themselves tall and mighty all around her, with... [catches himself masturbating] Mr. Hat, what the hell are you doing?! [looks around to see that no one is watching, then happily] Oh, Mr. Hat!

Bus stop, night. Stan waits with a book under his arm.
Stan
[checks his watch] Come on, where are they? [looks around. Three boys approach from his left: Kenny, Butters, and Timmy]
Stan
This is it??
Kenny
(Uh huh)
Timmy
Timmiiihh!
Stan
This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
Butters
Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
Stan
[quite disappointed] Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
Butters
Huh, where are we goin'?
Stan
We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. [the others look are shocked]
Switch to live action. Daytime in a middle class American backyard. A dyed sandy haired, middle-aged, white woman speaks with her sandy haired daughter while seated on the patio lounge.
Mother
[Smiling, empty-headed into the distance]
Daughter
[hesitantly] Mom... Do you ever have those heavy flow days?
Mother
[Places her hand comfortingly on her daughter's thigh] Oh absolutely sweetheart, everybody does.
Daughter
[Camera zooms in on her face] Mom, remember the movie The Shining where the elevator doors are opening up..
Mother
[Camera switches to close-up on mother's face] Oh honey what you need is a more absorbent tampon. [grabs her daughter's hand and shakes hands in emphasis]
Daughter
[Camera zooms back out] Like what?
Mother
Well, what's the most absorbent thing in the world?
Daughter
[Looks down, plays with her hair and mulls it over] Well... Cherokee hair I guess. [Camera zooms back on her face] But what does that have to do with me?
Mother
[Camera zooms out and mother grabs a box]
Because now there is all new, natural [Camera zooms in on mother who fakes a broad smile and holds a purple box of 'All Natural Cherokee Hair Tampons' with a Native woman that looks like the Land O' Lakes butter symbol] Cherokee hair tampons. [Broadens her fake smile].

Live action continues. Petri dish, on a table, with tampon is shown in front of tampon box while a light brown hand pours dyed blue water over the tampon. The tampon swells quickly.
Female announcer
[Speaking like an authority]
A cotton tampon can hold only so much liquid. [Scene slides over to another petri dish with tampon in front of box where the hand pours blue liquid on that tampon that swells more slowly] Other tampons also come up short. [Scene slides right again to a Cherokee woman laying on the table with her hair spread flat along the table] But Cherokee hair has been known for ages to be strong and powerful [The hand pours dyed blue water along the Cherokee woman's splayed hair, which doesn't absorb any of it, while the woman looks up at her hair] Each tampon is hand woven [A white woman's manicured hand holds up a hair 'tampon' bundle up with cross-hatched orange yarn, bead wrapped center and a white pull string for extraction] from over 200 strands of Cherokee hair and then bound together with these decorative native beads.

Live action continues. Front yard of suburban home. Daughter runs up to mother who is trimming the roses.
Daughter
You were right mom! All natural Cherokee hair tampons really did the trick. [Mother smiles back fakely and continues working]
Mother
And when you're done using them [She holds up Cherokee tampon] they make a great toy for Jessie. [Mother and daughter smile broad, fake smiles] Go get it boy! [Mother tosses Cherokee tampon off camera]
Jessie
[Tampon flies into the grass where Jessie, the white terrier grabs it and shakes it] Grrr... grrrr
Chief Running Pinto (Tommy Chong in his stoner voice)
[Camera shows mother and daughter smiling huge, fake smiles with their arms about each other peering into each other's face with the text 'Cherokee Hair Tampons' on the screen below. Mother mouths 'I love you'] Let the wonders and the mysteries of our people, like, change the way you think about tampons.
Cartman's house, night. Cartman is asleep in his bed... tossing and turning
Cartman
No! NO! Hip- hippies all around me. Help! Mommy! Huhuhippies!
Cartman's house, outside. Stan and the others approach, and Stan looks in the lower window. Stan now has a hand saw on his right hand
Stan
[softly] Okay, it's clear. [slowly opens the front door] Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
Timmy
Timmiihh!
Stan
Sshhh!
Timmy
[whispering] Timmiihh.
Stan
If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
Kenny
(Okay)
Timmy
[softly] Timmiihh.
Stan
Alright Butters, let's go. [they walk away and up the stairs, then down the hall, but Stan stops in his tracks] Uh-oh, Cartman's pig. [Fluffy is seen sleeping in her own little bed. Stan and Butters try to sneak past, but she opens her eyes] Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay. [Butters accidentally steps on Fluffy's tail and she squeals in panic. This wakes Cartman, who blinks and heads for his door half-asleep] Come on, we gotta get outta here! [runs a bit, then has his back to the wall as Cartman opens the door and walks out] Oh, no!
Butters
Oh well, we're busted. [Cartman continues towards Fluffy, Ignoring the boys]
Cartman
[smacks her] Shut up, Fluffy! [she quiets down and Cartman goes back to sleep, closing his door.]
Stan
Oh, phew.
Cartman's house, later. Cartman's nightmare returns
Cartman
Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! [Stan rises from the other side of the bed with the medical book, and Butters rises, too]
Stan
Okay, here we go. [opens the book and leafs through. Pictures of the heart, fingers, liver, and cutaway of the male genitalia are shown. Stan giggles softly and turns the page to a picture of the kidney] Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
Butters
I hope it's not too bloody; I'm wearin' my favorite pants.
Stan
...vein right, well- [brings out the saw] Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up. [Butters pulls the sheets, Stan the shirt, and something more is in their way] No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
Cartman
[rises quickly] whatwhatwhatwhat? [sees Stan and Butters] Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
Stan
You suck, Cartman!
Cartman
[faces them] Maybe so, but at least I was smart enough to wear a Kidney Blocker 2000!
Stan
God-dammit, don't you care that Kyle is gonna die?!
Cartman
I do! I do care! Look how much. [a blank expression is on his face] Look. Look how much I care. [the expressionless face persists]
Harequin Romance Book Publishing CO. Mr. Garrison has finished his novel and is now inside talking to a publisher
Publisher
First and foremost, Mr. Garrison, I would like to thank you for choosing Harequin Romance.
Mr. Garrison
Yeahyeahyeah. So, did you read the book?
Publisher
Uh yes, Mr. Garrison, we did read your book. [taps on it a few times]
Mr. Garrison
Well, what did you think?
Publisher
Well, uh, frankly, Mr. Garrison, n-we don't know if the Harequin Romance label is appropriate for you.
Mr. Garrison
Ooohhh, why not??
Publisher
Mr. Garrison, uh... are you aware that the word "penis" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel?
Mr. Garrison
Well, I'm sure there's lots of naughty words. It is a romance novel.
Publisher
Nnnno, I don't think that this book really qualifies as a "romance novel."
Mr. Garrison
No?
Publisher
[clears his throat] No. No, this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call... gay. Really, really gay.
Mr. Garrison
What the hell are you talkin' about?!
Publisher
It's just that the focus really seems to be on the... male organs.
Mr. Garrison
Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!
Publisher
It is.
Mr. Garrison
Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs! [the publisher has no answer] Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!
Publisher
[taps his chin] Hmmm.
South Park, next day. Stan and Kenny sit on the curb in front of "South Park Pianos"
Stan
[despondent, voice cracking] There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
Kenny
(You never seem to care when I die!)
Stan
[sobs] My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it. [begins to break down] Oh, God, he's my best friend... [weeps]
Kenny
[stands up] (Well now, that does it! I have had enough of this bullshit! Screw you, Stan. I'm going home!) [walks away. Above him, a man is hauling a piano, but realizes the ropes are tearing]
Mover
Look out! [the piano snaps from the ropes and crushes Kenny] Oops.
Stan
Awgh! I'll never see Kyle again! [weeps]
South Park, Miss Information's shop, day. More people line up to buy holistic stuff. Inside, Carlos Ramirez and Chief Running Pinto field orders.
Mrs.Tucker
Four dozen Cherokee hair tampons, please.
Chief Running Pinto
[hands them to her] No problem, man. Pay Miss Information up front. [she walks away with the tampons and Carlos glances at her ass]
Man 7
Hi, uh, I have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever I watch VH1.
Carlos Ramirez
Oh, here, try this, man. Ah, this is allll-naturalll ball juice. [the man takes it and drinks. Carlos and Chief Pinto chortle]
Man 7
Wow, I feel better already! [walks away. Carlos and Chief Pinto laugh some more.]
Miss Information
[joining the two men] And next we have Mrs. Broflovski's son. [Sheila drags Kyle in by his jacket collar]
Sheila
[let's him drop to the floor] Okay, here he is.
Chief Running Pinto
Ahahem, that kid looks really sick.
Miss Information
Yes. He really needs his toxins flushed again.
Chief Running Pinto
No. I mean, he looks REALLY sick, man. You should take him to, like, a doctor.
Customers
[look at each other] Hmm?
Sheila
But you're more in touch with the earth.
Chief Running Pinto
Look, bein' in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin', man.
Sharon
It's okay. We trust that you know what you're doing. [Carlos and Chief Pinto look at each other. Kyle groans]
Carlos Ramirez
No, man, that kid needs a doctor! And besides, we're not actually Native Americans. I mean, I'm- I'm more like a- a Mexican.
Customers
What?!
Man
Hu-uh?!
Carlos Ramirez
Yeah. A Mexican.
Man 7
Uugh. [spits out the ball juice] Ptu, ptu.
Man 8
I didn't know that.
Gerald
Oh my God! [Mrs.Tucker, who had purchased the 48 tampons screams in horror and covers her crotch area]
Sharon
How dare you deceive us like that!
Chief Running Pinto
Hey, we never said we were Native Americans, man. Miss Information said that.
Carlos Ramirez
Yeah. She said nobody would buy anything from Mexicans. [the customers blink in anger, then gather around Miss Information]
Miss Information
Uh, toxins are your enemy. [the customers enclose her]
Woman 1
Kill her! [the pummeling begins. Carlos and Chief Pinto just laugh at the sight]
Carlos Ramirez
Funny.
South Park, Miss Information's shop, later. Stan, Sheila, and Kyle are still there
Stan
So NOW can we take Kyle to the hospital?
Sheila
Yes, of course, but we don't have a kidney donor!
Stan
That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
Cartman's house, morning. A cock crows, and Cartman's radio sounds the alarm. Cartman rises on his bed and stretches
Cartman
Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA! [jumps back. His Kidney Blocker 2000 lies at the foot of his bed over streaks of blood] That son of a bitch!
Stan's house, moments later. Cartman approaches and pounds on the door. Stan quickly opens it.
Cartman
[fuming] Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!
Stan
Dude, please. Kyle needs it.
Cartman
It's MINE! Not yours, MINE! Give it back right now, or there's gonna be HELL to pay!
Stan
Alright, alright, here. [hands him a bloody kidney. Cartman reviews it.]
Cartman
Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
Hell's Pass Hospital, sometime later. Dr. Doctor is in his office.
Nurse
[over an intercom] Doctor, Eric Cartman is here- [Cartman enters unbid before she finishes speaking]
Dr. Doctor
Why, hello there, Eric. [Cartman stands on the chair and slaps the kidney down on the desk. The doctor looks on]
Cartman
You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in! [sits] Please.
Dr. Doctor
Oh, I see. [holds the kidney up] Are you sure that now that it's already out, you don't wanna just let your friend Kyle have it?
Cartman
No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
Dr. Doctor
Well, alright then. We'll get you prepped for surgery. [puts the kidney down and holds up a clipboard] If you'll just sign this release. [sets it in front of Cartman]
Cartman
Thank you. [signs the release form]
Hell's Pass Hospital, still later. Cartman and Kyle are in the recovery room surrounded by their parents. Stan and his parents are there, too. Balloons, a smiley-face and two banners, "I HOPE YOU GET BETTER!" and "GET WELL SOON", decorate Kyle's side of the room
Sheila
How are you feeling, boubbie?
Kyle
Better, thanks.
Stan
You look a lot better.
Sharon
Yeah, it looks like Western medicine really did the trick.
Kyle
Hey, thanks for going through all that to save my life, Stan.
Stan
Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
Chief Running Pinto
Yeah. [to Cartman] Hey, man, we're glad you're getting better, too.
Cartman
[wakes up] Heh. Hey, what what's going on?
Stan
Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!
Cartman
Huh?
Stan
It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
Dr. Doctor
Yes, but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release.
Liane
Isn't that funny, sweetie?
Cartman
Aarrrrrr! I am SO PISSED OFF!
Mr. Garrison
[enters the room and walks to Kyle's bed] Oh, here's everybody. [in his hand is a book]
Stan
Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?
Mr. Garrison
Boys, I have an announcement to make: I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. I've become a best-selling author! And Kyle, I want you to have a signed copy as a get-well present. [hands the book to Kyle, who looks at it]
Kyle
Oh. ...Thanks?
Cartman
[livid] I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
Stan
Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. [laughs a long time with Kyle]
Kyle
[white liquid spurts out his nose] Huh? [covers his nose] What the?
Cartman
Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
End of Cherokee Hair Tampons

Chef Goes Nanners
The Mayor's office, day. The mayor is at her desk, flanked by her assistants. Before her are Chef and Jimbo. The meeting starts
Mayor
Gentlemen, I understand you are here to present both sides of an issue. I wanna hear you both out and do this in a civil and constructive manner so that I can give you both the time and attention you deserve. Jimbo, why don't you begin?
Jimbo
Mayor, it's about the South Park flag.
Mayor
[instantly exasperated] Oh, Jesus Christ, not this again!
Jimbo
We cannot change the South Park flag, Mayor!
Chef
Mayor, as I've said before, I find that flag to be racist and insensitive!
Jimbo
Chef, I respect you very much, but you have to understand that this has been the South Park flag since some of our ancestors, like my great-grandfather, founded this land!
Chef
That flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites! How can a black man not be bothered by it?!
Mayor
Ahalright, Chef, I'll have my assistants hold up the flag. [the one with the bang goes to get it] and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it. [the assistant returns and gives one end to Johnson. They unfurl the flag between them. The flag shows a black figure dangling from a hangman's noose, and two white figures on either side of him rejoicing. "South Park" is written underneath]
Chef
You don't see anything wrong with that flag?!
Jimbo
Chef, what about the baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, huh? Should they change their name because it's racist?
Chef
Yeah!
Jimbo
No, because it's their history!
Chef
Look, I have gone to every quiet protest I could! I have written everyone; I've put up signs! But now I'm telling you [points to the mayor and emphasizes], THIS FLAG WILL BE CHANGED!
Jimbo
And I'm telling you it WON'T!
Mayor
[rolls her eyes] Oh, boy.
South Park Elementary, day. The class bell rings and the kids are in their seats. Timmy is now shown with the class.
Mr. Wyland
Okay, children, in Mr. Garrison's absence, I would like to turn the class's attention to current issues. Some people think the South Park flag should be changed, while others believe that changing the flag is wrong. I think this is a perfect subject for your debate club.
Class
[Timmy stays quiet] Aaaaah!
Mr. Wyland
I see that you've already had a lot of interesting debates this year. [points to a chart with three debates on it] Pro-Choice vs. Cartman, Pro-Gun Control vs. Cartman, a-and People Against the Clubbing of Baby Seals vs. Cartman. And apparently, the winner of all your debates so far has been… Cartman.
Cartman
Thaaat's ri-ight.
Kyle
Cartman doesn't always win! He just gets pissed off and goes home so we can't debate anymore!
Class
[including Timmy] Yeah.
Cartman
Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
Stan
You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
Cartman
Yes I do!
Craig
No you don't!
Cartman
Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! [rises from his seat, heads for the door, and exits]
Kyle
Told ya.
Mr. Wyland
Alright, children, well, unlike Mr. Garrison, I want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams. Tomorrow, you'll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on. [the class stares back blankly]
Jimbo and Ned's lodge, after school. They're sitting on the front porch.
Jimbo
This is about history, kids. [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and two others are present] If you don't have respect for your past, then you can never expect to- BIRD! [he and Ned each take a shot at it, and it tumbles away, falling dead into a large pile of dead birds on the road behind the boys] -then you can never expect to have a future. Nowadays, everyone wants to change mascots and flags because they're not [does quotes with his left index and middle finger] "politically correct." Well, where does it end? I mean, people are gonna start sayin' that the Denver Broncos are offensive to horses. And then we'll have to- a SQUIRREL! [He and Ned take shots at it, and it falls dead from its branch] And then we'll have to change everything, and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten. But to REALLY understand the South Park's flag's importance, you need to know about South Park's history. Ned here's a big history buff, and he can tell you the whole story. Ned?
Ned
Nnneh, in 1867, fourteen pioneers from the East Coast traveled across the Plains-
Stan
Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
Kyle
Yeah, we got it.
Jimbo
You sure?
Stan, Kyle
Yup.
Jimbo
You boys go make me proud now and win that debate- Chris Peterson! [he and Ned fire away, and Chris yells and dodges the bullets, then runs off] God-damnit, we missed him again!
South Park Supermarket, after school. Chef is at the entrance with a petition in his hands. With him are Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, and Butters. Some folks head for the store…
Chef
Sign up to join me, and come marching to the Mayor's office in protest of the South Park flag! [the shoppers brush on by and enter the store, and the doors close] You see that, children?! Nobody wants to get involved! [the doors open and Randy Marsh walks out with a bag of groceries. Chef notices] Randy! Sign up to march with me against the South Park flag on Wednesday?
Randy
Oh, uuhh, look, Chef, you know I'm-m not a racist, but uh, I just don't really feel strongly one way or another about the flag.
Chef
Well, alright, Marsh, you're entitled to your own opinion. [Randy walks away and Chef looks at the kids] That's how it is in this town. I haven't gotten one signature on this damn sheet, and I've been here all day!
Wendy
We'll march with you, Chef.
Chef
That's nice, but I need the support of some registered voters. [Mr. Mackey walks out with some groceries. Chef stops him] Ey, Mackey! Sign up to march on Wednesday?
Mr. Mackey
Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon.
Chef
Alright, fudge it, Thursday. Anyone else wanna go Thursday?
Principal Victoria
[arrives] Thursday's no good, we've got choir council.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, yeah.
Principal Victoria
What about next Sunday?
Chef
Fine! Next Sunday!
Man 1
You mean, during the ball game?
Man 2
Oh, yeah. We can't do Sunday.
Chef
Monday??
Principal Victoria
Oh, I can't do Monday.
Man 3
[arrives] I could do Tuesday.
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, Tuesday morning's good.
Man 1
You know what would be better for me is Saturday afternoon.
Man 2
Saturday is perfect for me.
Principal Victoria
Yeah. How about Saturday at 11:30?
Man 3
Mm hmm.
Man 2, Woman 2
Yeah.
Man 1
Yeah.
Man 3
That sounds good.
Man 2
Mm hmm.
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, I think that's the best day.
Chef
Okay! On Saturday, we march!
Man 2
Oh, march? What are we marching for?
Chef
To bring down the South Park Flag!
Man 2
…Oh. [the adults begin to disperse]
Man 3
Oohh, I gotta go.
Man 1
I know what I may like. I don't like marching
Woman 2
Uh, marching's really not for me.
Man 2
See you later.
South Park Elementary, next day. Mr. Wyland's class. He's at the chalkboard tallying up the votes. There are eight votes on each side of the board: eight on the left for "FLAG SHOULD CHANGE," eight on the right for "FLAG SHOULD STAY THE SAME"
Mr. Wyland
Well I've counted up all your secret ballots, children, and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay, and half think the flag should be changed.
Wendy
How could any of you think that flag should stay the way it is?!
Mr. Wyland
Save it for the debate, Wendy. Now I'm going to assign the debate leaders. Who wants to lead the "Flag Should Stay The Way It Is" team?
Stan, Kyle
Me. Me. Me. Me.
Wendy
[upset] Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!
Stan
Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag.
Kyle
Yeah, me neither.
Mr. Wyland
Alright. Stan and Kyle, [turns and writes on the board] you can both be the team leaders for the "Flag should stay the way it is" team. [turns around. Their names are there now] Now, who wants to lead the "Flag should be changed" team? [an angry Wendy raises her hand. Cartman looks over at her, then raises his hand and chuckles] Okay, Wendy and Eric can team up. [writes their names on the board]
Wendy
[mortified] Nooo! [Cartman chuckles some more]
Mr. Wyland
Alright, children. Do your homework, and let's get ready for a great debate!
South Park Elementary, cafeteria. Kids enjoy their meals. Craig enters the kitchen, followed by Stan, Kyle, Butters, and someone else
Stan, Kyle
Hello, Chef.
Chef
[in a foul mood] My name isn't Chef anymore, children. I've converted to Islam.
Stan
Islam??
Chef
From now on, my name is [points to his apron] Abdul Mohammed Jabar [points to the rest of his name on a sign held by an Arab assistant] Rauf Kareem Ali. [proceeds with preparing the trays] With everyone in town so insensitive about the flag, I find it no longer fitting to use my slave name!
Stan
Well, we need help with our debate club. We have to explain why we think the flag should not be changed.
Chef
You WHAT?! [plants his fists on the counter while the assistant struggles to keep his half of the name sign in line with Chef's apron] You don't think they should change the flag?!
Kyle
Not really.
Stan
Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
Chef
[moves to his right and sets the ladle and a pot down] Well, that figures you don't! Because your cracker-ass parents turned you into little cracker-ass cracker-racists! I never thought I'd live to see this many of the people I considered friends turn against me!
Stan
But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
Chef
But nothin'! [picks up the ladle and throws it down] "But" my ass! Fix your own damn food! [hurries out, and his assistant quickly follows. Stan and Kyle look at each other, confused]
South Park Elementary, school library. Wendy has assembled her team and leads them through preliminary items. In her team are Bebe, Clyde, Butters, Token, Kevin, and three others. Cartman is not there yet.
Wendy
Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-
Cartman
[enters] It's okay, I'm here.
Wendy
[glares at him for a few seconds] Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
Cartman
[begins pacing] Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
Wendy
[stunned] What??
Cartman
That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility! [starts barking orders] Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
Butters
Wwuhuh-o-kay! [hops off his chair. Wendy watches him leave]
Cartman
The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
Clyde
Right. [the others disperse, leaving Wendy and Cartman facing each other at the round table.]
Cartman
[takes out some Cheesy Poofs] Mmmm.
Wendy
[walks up to him] Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.
Cartman
You're right. We'll need to look like we prepared a case, too, so that they look all the weaker. Good plan. Sooo, what's the issue again?
Wendy
The South Park flag!
Cartman
Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?
Wendy
D'aaaaahhh!
Cartman
Whoa! Calm down, ho. [eats some poofs]
South Park City Hall, day. A Channel 4 field reporter is on scene. Chef is in the background dressed in a daishiki facing the Hall, with his fist up. Two groups of people are there, one on either side of him. The mayor and her assistants look out over the scene from her office
Reporter
["NEWS 4 LIVE!"] Tom, I'm standing out front of the South Park Mayor's Office, where both sides of this debate have gathered.
Chef
Change the flag!
Jimbo
Don't change history!
Mayor
Oh brother, what now?!
Chef
[background, as the reporter speaks] Change the flag! Change the flag!…
Reporter
Earlier, the South Park townspeople voiced their opinion.
Man 4
[angry] Well, I think the flag is racist! [turns pensive] Huh, but then again, it is part of our history.
Man 5
Well, I guess the flag is part of history, …but I can see how it is racist.
Man 6
[flatly, slowly] I think it is history. I think it is racist.
Reporter
Well, one things for sure, tensions are high and pressure is mounting on the South Park Mayor to do something.
Chef
[background, as the reporter speaks] …Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! Change the flag! [the mayor simply looks down] In the 1960s there was a monk [shows a photo of Thích Quảng Đức in flames] who set himself on fire to protest! You have left me no choice! [lowers the photo] To protest your lack of humanity, I will now do the same thing! [raises a portable gas tank and a lighter, then pours the gasoline on a Tibetan monk and sets him on fire]
Monk
[in flames] Huh! Haaaaaaaaaaaah! [dies]
The KKK
[arriving] White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
Reporter
[stunned, then speaks] What's this? Uh, Tom, it looks as if the KKK have shown up to express their opinion.
KKK Leader
[walks up to Jimbo and extends his hand.] Hello, brother. [Jimbo and his group turns to see the Klan] We are here to support your noble cause.
Jimbo
Huh? Uh hey now, uh. We don't want your support. We're not racists; this is about history.
Ned
Yeah.
KKK Leader
Well, whether you want our support or not, we're on your side! [he and the rest of the KKK face right and march away]
The KKK
White Power! White Power! [Jimbo and the others watch them leave] White Power! White Power! [they take up positions in front of City Hall, facing Chef. A familiar figure is chanting with them] White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
Sheila
[arrives] Mr. Garrison, you're a Klan member?
Mr. Garrison
NO, no, [steps out] but Mr. Hat is. [points to the puppet, which is dressed in a Klan robe and bends down a few times as if to say "hello"]
Mr. Garrison
[Voicing Mr. Hat] White Power! White Power!
Mr. Garrison
Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat.
The KKK
White Power!
Chef
Change the flag!
Jimbo
Don't change history!
Mayor
Ooh, Jesus. What a mess.
South Park City Hall, Mayor's office, later.
Mayor
Chef, we realize that you find the South Park flag racist, and we certainly understand your case. [shot of an angry Chef] We have been diligently working on this problem, put in a lot of hours, and we have finally altered the flag in a way that we think will make you very happy. Gentlemen? [her assistants lift up a flag and carry it to a clear area, then unfurl it for Chef to see] There. Is that better? [It looks the same…]
Chef
No, damnit!
Mayor
[points to the black figure] No, but look! He's got a little smile now! [a close-up reveals closed eyes and a smile] See? He's happy. Much better, don't you think? [Chef just rises and walks out. The mayor lumps in her chair] Well, some people just won't work with you at all. This is getting out of hand. How do I absolve myself of an responsibility with this?
Johnson
Mayor, the-ee South Park Elementary children are discussing the flag issue in their debate club on Friday.
Assistant
We… could use the debate as an excuse to hold a vote on the issue.
Mayor
Yes, of course. Let the children be responsible. Everybody loves children. Tell the press. South Park Elementary will be holding a vote on Friday!
South Park Elementary, school library. Wendy has three stacks of books to pore over, Cartman is playing with his toys
Wendy
This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-
Cartman
I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone![as Bog Monster] O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
Wendy
If we could show a parallel between the South Carolina case-
Cartman
[as Captain Candycone] Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts![as Bog Monster] Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts![as Captain Candycone] I'll kick you in the nuts!
Wendy
Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!
Cartman
You won't let me help.
Wendy
That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
Cartman
[thinks a moment…] …Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it. [Wendy remains mad at him. He does Bog Monster] Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih. [she averts her gaze, then breaks into a smile] Wendih. Seriouslih. [she chuckles] The Bog Monster speaketh.
South Park, the offices of Brovlofski and Jackson, Attorneys At Law. Kyle and Stan have assembled their team there. Kenny, Craig and Tweek are there with two others.
Kyle
Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want. [Kenny chows down tablets from a blue bowl before him] Who wants to read them? [no one responds]
Stan
Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
Kyle
Kenny, how many of my dad's mints are you gonna eat? Jesus!
Kenny
(Plenty. This is 'cause my family's poor.)
Kyle
I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
Kenny
(Ah, fuck you!) [gives him the finger]
Stan
I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
Kyle
Dude, you're just saying that because she's your girlfriend.
Kenny
[burps] (Hey, can I have a drink of water?)
Kyle
Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. [Kenny hops off and walks to the dispenser]
Stan
Yeah, you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints. [Mr. Broflovski enters]
Gerald
[stops behind Kenny's chair] Hey, boys, how's the research coming?
Kyle
Pretty good, I guess.
Stan
Do you think they should change the flag?
Gerald
Oh, uuhh. I don't know. [picks up the empty bowl]
Kyle
Kenny ate all the mints, dad.
Gerald
Oh, those weren't mints, those were antacid tablets.
Kyle
Oh.
Stan, Kyle
Kenny! [Mr. Broflovski looks in anticipation]
Kenny
[drinks the water, then looks at them] (What?) [the tablets start to fizz] (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!) [as his voice rises, his body balloons and foam comes out of all possible orifices. Then he bursts and parts of him fall all over. Some antacid squirts out of somewhere. At the table, body parts and antacid cover some books, parts of the table, and on parts of everyone left. The other students and Mr. Broflovski laugh. Stan and Kyle clap somewhat]
Stan
That was a good one.
South Park City Hall. The KKK is still rallying. Mr. Hat keeps Mr. Garrison in place
The KKK
White Power! White Power!
KKK Leader
Do not change the flag! It is a symbol of white power!
The KKK
White Power!
Mr. Garrison
[now next to the leader] Oohh, I'm sorry, Chef. Mr. Hat is a racist son of a bitch.
Mr. Garrison
[Voicing Mr. Hat] Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker!
Mr. Garrison
[shocked] Dugh! [covers his mouth. Chef looks at him an angry disbelief] Ogh. Waaaaah! [runs away]
Chef
[approaches one group] How can you all just stand by and let these racists do this?!
Officer Barbrady
Well, Chef, it's freedom of speech. We don't like it, but we can't arrest them for talking.
Reporter
Should the Klan be allowed to rally on the steps of the Capitol? Here's what some people think.
Man 7
Well, I think they are racist, but I… do think freedom of speech is important.
Man 8
Well, I, for one, believe in freedom of speech. …Mmm but then again, I think they are racist.
Man 9
Well, I believe that they are racist, but I do believe that all-
Chef
[shoves the man out of the way] Aw, the hell with all of you indecisive bastards!
Reporter
On Friday, South Park Elementary will present its debate, and after the debate, there will finally be a vote. Preliminary polls show three in favor of changing the flag, three against changing the flag, and 4382 undecided. [Results show on screen in text beside him]Z So the pressure in on those South Park kids!
KKK Leader
Well, that's enough rallying for this afternoon, members. Let's take a hot shower!
The KKK
Hot shower! Hot shower! Hot shower! [they march away]
Jimbo
[to Ned] Ned, nobody's gonna vote for our side if it's the side those KKK members are on. Come on, we gotta put a stop to them.
South Park Elementary, school library, night. Wendy and Cartman are both laboring over books. Between them is a tray of Oreo cookies.
Wendy
I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.
Cartman
[aloof] Uh huh.
Wendy
Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
Cartman
Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
Wendy
Huh?
Cartman
I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
Wendy
[mulls over the argument] Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.
Cartman
Yeah.
Wendy
Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. [takes a cookie]
Cartman
Cool.
Wendy
Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. [starts eating]
Cartman
Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make "quadruple stuffs."
Wendy
Hey, that's what I always do, too!
Cartman
No way!
Wendy
Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.
Cartman
Me neither. [Romantic music starts to play]
Wendy
Aha ha.
Cartman
Huh.
Wendy, Cartman
Well, anyway, let's get back to work. [two kids speak in unison]
Cartman
Whoa.
Wendy
Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag. [reaches for a cookie] We can show that the- [Cartman's hand rests on hers. Their eyes meet and the music crescendos]
Cartman
[withdraws his hand] Ur, s-sorry. [shoves the plate to her a bit] Go ahead.
Wendy
No. [shoves the plate back, Music fades.] You go ahead.
South Park transition music. Mr. Garrison's house, night. The living room. Mr. Garrison enters
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?
Mr. Garrison
[Voices Mr. Hat] There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
Mr. Garrison
Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.
Mr. Garrison
[Voices Mr. Hat] But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
Mr. Garrison
Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!
Mr. Garrison
[Voices Mr. Hat] I'm going whether you like it or not!
Mr. Garrison
Oh yeah?! [sits in his armchair and waits] I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final! [looks away] Let's just see you try and go without me! [looks back again, and his right hand is bare] Mi-Mr. Hat?
South Park, the woods. The KKK rallies around a burning cross.
The KKK
White Power! White Power! White Power! [Jimbo and Ned rise up out of the brush and look at the rally] White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power! White Power!
Jimbo
[softly, during the rally] Alright, Ned. We've got to be careful. These are really evil men we're dealing with.
Ned
Mmm-okay.
Jimbo
Damnit Ned, doesn't that thing have a volume control?
Ned
No.
The KKK
White Power! White Power!
KKK Leader
[walks in and stands in front of the burning cross, raising his arms to quiet the group] Good evening, brothers. Our first order of business tonight is to have Brother Anderson update us on last week's minutes.
Brother Anderson
Last week we decided we hate blacks and Jews. A lot!
KKK Leader
Alright. And now it's time for us all to come together, and… do our cake raffle.
KKK Members
[ad lib] Oh, cake raffle. [Jimbo and Ned look at each other]
KKK Leader
This week's winner is… [reads the ticket] uh, 2 9 7 4.
Ticket 2974 Holder
[jumps for joy] I won, I won. [moves forward] I won the cake! [takes it and returns to his place]
KKK Leader
God job, brother. [smattering of applause. Jimbo and Ned look on.]
Happy music plays. A green and flowering meadow under a brilliant orange dawn. A happy Wendy walks in and grabs some flowers, then sniffs them deeply. She then looks behind her to find a topless Cartman sitting on a white steed under a bright yellow sun. Romantic music swells. The steed neighs
Wendy
[turns and runs to him] Cartman! [Cartman gets off the steed and runs to Wendy, his hair billowing in the wind]
Cartman
Ahh! [they run into each other's arms and tumble down, laughing all the while. At the bottom, Wendy's on her back and Cartman is on top of her]
Wendy
Say it'll be like this forever.
Cartman
Okay, It will be like this forever.
Wendy
Oh, Cartman! [Cartman looks at her, his hair billowing in the wind]
Wendy's room, night. She rises in bed with a start. That scene in the meadow was a dream
Wendy
AAAAAAaaaah! [pants heavily, then dunks her head in the fish bowl on the little desk next to her bed.] Brrrrr. What's wrong with me? [hops down and heads for the bathroom, flips the lights on, goes to the sink, hops on a stool, and checks out her tongue and eyes, while Russel Crowe poster behind her stares on] Ahhh. It's okay. Get a grip, girl. [hops down and heads for the switch. She's about to turn off the lights when a voice stops her]
Cartman's voice
Wendih. [she looks at the Russell Crowe poster next to the switch] Wendih. [Rusell's face stretches into one of Cartman]
Wendy
[shocked at the hallucination] Aaaah!
Cartman's voice
[the face reverts to Russell's as the voice fades] Wendih, look at me.
Wendy
[turns around, looks up, then sits down with her face in her hands] Oh God, please don't let this be happening.
South Park, the woods, deep in the night.
KKK Leader
Alright brothers, listen up! [two more members looking suspiciously familiar show up, and the leader starts to pace back and forth] As you know, this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag. But lynching minorities is history! So what are we gonna do about it?!
Member 1
Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll burn down the Capitol!
KKK Members
Yeah!
Member 2
Let's say that if they change the flag, we'll never leave this town!
KKK Members
Yeah!
Jimbo
[in KKK disguise] Let's say they should change the flag!
KKK Members
Yeah! [turn to see the new member] Wah?
KKK Leader
Uh what's that, brother?
Jimbo
I think we should switch sides!
Ned
Me too. Nnn-that's a good idea.
Jimbo
Look, we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us, right?
KKK Members
[rolling reaction] Yeah, m-hm.
Jimbo
So, whatever side we're on is the side that's gonna lose, right?
KKK Members
[rolling reaction] Right, yeah.
Jimbo
So why don't we all say that we want the flag changed. That way, most folks'll vote to keep it the way it is.
KKK Leader
That's a great idea, brother!
KKK Members
[jubilant, jumping] Yeah!
KKK Leader
Alright, it is decided! We will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed, so that they will all vote against us!
KKK Members
[ad lib] Hooray, yeah! [the two new members leave]
A Member
We're smart! [the two members head into the brush]
Jimbo
[both members take off their hoods] That worked perfectly, Ned.
KKK Leader
Well alright, now that that's out of the way, it is time to play, "Whose got the silliest thing on under their robe?"
KKK Members
[ad lib] Yeah, woohoo! [a member walks up to an organ and sits. He begins to play "If You're Happy And You Know It…" The rest form two lines and clap.]
The contest. The first member walks down the middle and shows off his boxers with a heart design. The second comes in and shows off his lederhosen. The third comes in and shows off bikini briefs and garters. The fourth comes in and shows off a yellow bird costume.
Jimbo
[Watching from the bushes with their hoods now off]Jesus, Ned, these guys are completely nuts.
Ned
Mm-yup.
the fifth member comes in and shows off his hand-walking skills, and the sixth one shows off his penis… Jimbo and Ned walk away from the scene
Jimbo
[stops] That is the most insane thing I've ever seen. I can't believe those people are on our side. I mean, is our side that crazy? [some headlights pass over them and they shield their eyes. A station wagon rolls up with Chef behind the wheel. Jimbo waves hello.] Oh, hello, Chef. Big debate tomorrow, I guess. [Chef glowers at them for a few seconds. Dramatic music plays.] Oh, Jesus, the robes! Chef, this isn't what it looks like. You've gotta listen to us!
Chef
I ain't gonna listen to nothin'! This whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass! [peels off. Mud flies behind the Town & Country and splatters Jimbo and Ned]
Jimbo
Ned, I'm starting to think that maybe history ain't worth defendin' sometimes.
Scene-change music. Wendy's house, morning, before school. Living room
Wendy
[leads Bebe in] Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.
Bebe
Sure, what?
Wendy
Bebe, I'm attracted to Cartman.
Bebe
[shrieks and covers her ears] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Wendy
[ashamed] I know.
Bebe
Why would you tell me this? Why would you tell anyone this?
Wendy
Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-
Bebe
Alright, look. When two people work closely for a long time, sometimes they feel what's called, "sexual tension." Sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with.
Wendy
You mean, I should kiss him? [looks away embarrassed]
Bebe
Kiss him and get it out of your system.
Wendy
[dreading] Oh God.
South Park Elementary, the gym. Mr. Wyland is shown behind a podium, and the South Park flag hangs from some rafters behind him. Two tables are set up, one for each side of the debate. Behind the "FLAG SHOULD STAY THE SAME" table are Stan, Kyle, and two other boys. Behind the "FLAG SHOULD CHANGE" table are Wendy, Cartman, Token, and Butters.
Mr. Wyland
Well I certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club. [the bleachers are shown. The mayor, Chef, Jimbo and Ned, and others are present] I r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well, so, perhaps the children can shed some light on us. We'll start with Wendy Testaburger on the "Flag Should Be Changed" team. [Wendy hops off her seat, then looks at Cartman and strokes her chin, then steps up to look at the audience. She looks again at Cartman. He's been watching her all the while, wondering where this is all headed]
Wendy
[Piano music implying a pending dramatic moment approaches. Wendy looks at the audience] The- [looks at Cartman] the- uh, [clears her throat] aheh ahum, [looks at Cartman] the… the- uh, [closes her eyes and pushes her hands out as if to push away the feelings swirling within] Ahhhhh, [exhales softly, then sighs] The first argument we- [her eyes snap back to Cartman, who's still watching her. Stan and Kyle watch as well] ah… [resets] Let me start over. [looks at Stan] The uh- [loses her rudder] oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment? [steps down and kisses a surprised Cartman full on the lips while she makes high pitched, humming sounds] Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...
People in Audience
[ad lib] Oh. [Stan's jaw drops]
Really Shocked Man
[off camera] Oh, God! [Butters' and Token's jaws drop. So does Chef's. Wendy finally releases the pucker, sighs in happy relief, and goes back to the podium]
Wendy
[confident now] There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. [steps down as people clap. Stan is still in shock that Wendy kissed Cartman. She sits down, Cartman looks at her, then places his hands behind his head in a supreme air of confidence and looks away]
Mr. Wyland
Okay, and Kyle and Stan's team, your main point? [Kyle moves to the podium while Stan remains stunned]
Kyle
Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill. [an astonished Stan looks as Cartman puts his right hand on the back of Wendy's chair and points at her with his left, winks, then does a victory hand dance. A smiling Wendy remains oblivious to this showing off] And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. [returns to his seat amid a smattering of applause]
Chef
[stands up] Whoa whoa whooaa! You just missed the point entirely!
Kyle
Huh?
Chef
I'm not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin' killed, It's because it's racist!
Kyle's Team
[minus Stan who's mouth is still hanging open as he stares at Wendy] Racist??
Chef
Children, don't you even know what this argument is about?! That flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people.
Kyle's Team
[minus Stan still shocked] Ooooooohhh.
Chef
Ooooooohhh?!
Kyle
W-we really didn't see it that way.
Chef
But that's a black man up there!
Kyle
Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
Chef
Well of course it matters when- [catches himself] …Oh my God. Wait a minute. You children didn't even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people, did you?
Kyle's Team
[except stunned Stan] No.
Chef
[deducing, marveling] Why, that is- that is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard.
Mayor
What?
Mr. Wyland
What?
Chef
Don't you see? All this time I thought these little crackers had turned racist, when actually they were so not racist that they didn't even make a separation of black and white to begin with. All they saw when they looked at that flag was five people.
A Few People
Awww.
Some KKK members
Awww.
Kyle
Yeah. [Cartman is still showing off, Wendy remains oblivious, Stan remains shocked]
Chef
I'm sorry, children. I was wrong about you. But I still the flag needs to be changed. But now I realize that I almost let racism turn me into a racist.
Jimbo
Yeah. You know, uh I suddenly found myself on the side of Klan members. I've never had anything against blacks, Chef.
Chef
Oh, I know you don't, Jimbo. I've known you for almost ten years. You're a good man.
Jimbo
We've been way too divisive over this, Chef. Maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with.
Chef
I think that's a much better start than me tryin' to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers.
Audience Members
[relieved, ad lib] Ooh, huhuh. Oooh [Stan's astonished gaze was fixed on Cartman and Wendy all that time while Cartman continued his happy hand dance.]
Kyle
Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now. [waves his hand in front of Stan to get his attention] Stan?
South Park City Hall, day. The Mayor has called a town meeting at City Hall and now stands at her podium with the town gathered before her. Something hangs above her covered by a brown curtain
Mayor
This has been an interesting week in South Park. We've all done a lot of growing this week. [shot of the crowd, some of them smiling] Everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue. But now we have learned once again that black, white, yellow, brown, or whatever, we are all just people. And so, I am very excited to unveil our new South Park Flag! [The curtain falls away to reveal the same flag, only with the five people, including the hanged man, holding hands. The crowd cheers. From left to right: a white man, a yellow man, the hanged black man, a red man, and another black man]
Stan
[recovered, looks at the flag] Wait, I don't get it.
Kyle
No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
Chef
Hooray!
Jimbo
I have to admit it, that is a lot nicer.
Wendy
Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. [the applause begins to die down]
Cartman
Me, too!
Wendy
[applause stops, background music plays] I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.
Cartman
[fronting] Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.
Wendy
I'm totally back to normal. See you later. [the crowd disperses behind her as she pats Cartman's shoulder]
Cartman
Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho, [finger points at her] huhuh, he, haha.
Wendy
Hahaha. [looks off to her right] Stan. Stan, wait up! [hurries away to catch up to him. Cartman looks at her, then away, then at her long, then away, than at her quick one last time, then looks down and sighs. He turns to his left and walks away, dejected]
End of Chef Goes Nanners

Something You Can Do with Your Finger
A large city at night. Klieg lights pierce through the air as a large crowd gathers in front of a large building.
Announcer
Tonight, Stellar Productions presents the boy band of the decade! [women scream, jump, and shout. Signs saying, "FINGERBANG RULES" "FINGER BANG" "WE LOVE FINGER BANG" AND "FINGER BANG 4EVER" bob throughout the audience] It's Fingerbang, live from Madison Square Gardens! [the interior is shown, with cheering crowds. A heralding sound effect plays, and spotlights flicker around the stage. A burst of fireworks cues the music and the familiar silhouettes of four boys are shown on stage. A few women faint]
Fingerbang
[the lights go on them, and it's the boys, dressed in white outfits. Their hats are all white, too. A green shirt indicates Kyle, a blue one Stan. Kenny wears an orange visor over his white hood. All wear headsets]
Fingerbang!
[they each spin towards the audience once, then stop]
Bang-bang!
Fingerbang-bang!
[they spin back to their first positions]
Bangbangbang!
[all step forward and do their routine]
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you ever-y night

Cartman
[steps forward for a solo bridge as the others sway back and forth]
And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl

Woman
[as Cartman sings] Cartman, I want youuu!
Cartman
[continues] My... girrrrrrrl... [lifts up his shirt to show off the right breast—um, pec. The others turn to their right while maintaining their gaze and pointing their gun fingers at the audience. The music builds as women scream at the sight]

Fingerbang
[Cartman rejoins the others and all point their gun fingers at the audience, then resume the routine]
Fingerbang!
Bang... Bang bang bang
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang!
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang--

Cartman's room, night. He's tossing and turning joyfully in his sleep. The song continues playing in his mind:
"--you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright"

Cartman
Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm-- [wakes up, then looks angry] Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-dammit! [suddenly thinks] Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million, don't you? That's it! [rushes out of bed]
Cartman residence, day. Cartman has Stan, Kyle, and Kenny over in the living room.
Cartman
[pacing back and forth] Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives. [stops and faces them] God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million.
Kyle
...How?
Cartman
Boy band.
Stan
Boy band?
Cartman
Boy band.
Kyle
I'm not being in any [crosses his arms over his chest] faggy boy band!
Cartman
There's nothing faggy about $10 million, asshole! This was a message from God!
Stan
Dude, we don't have any musical talent.
Cartman
That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass! [pulls out a tape from his back pocket] I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
Kenny
(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
Cartman
Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall. [intense] So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
Kyle
Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
Cartman
So?
Kyle
So, all boy bands have five members.
Cartman
What?
Kyle
'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members.
Stan
He's right.
Cartman
[throws down the tape] Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!
Marsh residence, night. The family is gathered for dinner, enjoying ham and turkey
Sharon
Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?
Stan
Well, I guess.
Sharon
What did you do?
Stan
Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. [Randy reacts, and Shelly takes notice]
Sharon
Oh well, that sounds nice.
Randy
[to Sharon, angrily] No, it does NOT sound nice! [to Stan] Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band.
Stan
Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
Randy
[rises] If all your friends jumped off a cliff, [jabs his finger at Stan] would you do that too?
Stan
[voice shaking] Cartman says we can make $10 million.
Randy
You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! [storms out]
Shelly
Geez, what's up Dad's ass?
Cartman residence, next morning, "BOY BAND AUDITIONS TODAY!!" Music begins. Inside, Butters is singing his song in front of the sofa
Butters
[holds two fingers on his right hand up to indicate a hopping bunny]
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
[scoops up imaginary mice, makes two fists, and bops the right one with the left]
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
[shimmies down with hands outstretched. The auditors look half-asleep]
Down came a white angel and she said
[the angel (left finger) reprimands the bunny]
"Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
[the piano player seems familiar. The angle bops the bunny]
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head"
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
[slaps his right hand with his left, and one finger goes down, leaving a worm]
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
[grins, then does a little kick forward]

Cartman
[through the mic] Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
Butters
Ah, I can do it again.
Cartman
[through the mic] We'll let you know, Butters.
Butters
Ahah-oo well, alright then. [walks off to his left, unsure]
Cartman
Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
Kyle
It was?
Stan
Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that.
Cartman
Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better</> do it better than that. [into the mic] Next!
Stan
[reads from a list] Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.
Cartman
Kyle's brother?
Kyle
I promised my mom I'd let him try. [Ike hops in with some sheet music]
Cartman
Christ's sake..!
Schroeder
What key?
Ike

[hands him the sheet]
G.
[hops back to the sofa as the kid plays]
Itsy bitsy spider, out the water spout--

Cartman
[through the mic] Next!
Ike
Oh Danny Boy, the parson's calling
Clang, clang and clang

Cartman
[through the mic] Next audition!
Ike
E F G, H I J K L-M-N-O-P

Cartman
[through the mic] Goddammit, NEXT!
Ike
One on a teacher on a palm tree
"G-U-B, When the teacher wanna punch me"

Cartman
[through the mic] Not the next song, the next PERSON! [Ike goes for his sheet music, then returns to flip Cartman off.] Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. [the front door opens and in walks Wendy with her sheet music. She walks to the piano player, gives it to him--]
Cartma
Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a boy band! [a grinning Wendy suddenly frowns and her head hangs.]
Stan
Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.
Cartman
[moves the mic away] No way!
Kyle
Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
Cartman
Okayokay, fine. Wow me.
Wendy
[cues the player]
Miiis-suuus Landers was a health nut; She cooked food in a wok
Mr. Harris was her boyfriend, and he had a great big-

And if you all don't like it, I don't give a flying fuck!
[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny applaud]

Cartman
Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. [Wendy is angered]
Kyle
Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
Cartman
Dude, she's a chick!
Stan
Come on, nobody's gonna notice.
Cartman
"Nobody's gonna notice"?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! [Wendy looks down at her chest]
Stan
She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
Kyle
Me too.
Kenny
(Me too.)
Cartman
Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
Wendy
[exults] Yeah!
Cartman's house, next morning, early. A rooster crows. Cartman has his band in his room, and they are still drowsy. Stan is about to fall over...
Cartman
Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
Stan
Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
Cartman
We have to rehearse all that we can! [moves away] Now, check this out: [returns with a box of clothes and sets it on the floor] My mom made us costumes!
Stan
Costumes? [the band gathers around the box]
Cartman
Yeah. [starts handing out the costumes] This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... [she looks a little embarrassed]
Stan
Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
Cartman
'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough.
Kyle
[dryly] I wanna be the tough one.
Cartman
[looks back blankly] ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
Kyle
[determined] I wanna be the tough one!
Cartman
You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
Kyle
Jews are tough!
Cartman
Since when?!
Kyle
Since Abraham, fatass!
Cartman
Alright, fine! Here! [tosses the tough costume at Kyle, knocking him down] Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! [moves away. The band dresses. Kenny is a baseball player, Stan is a fighter pilot, Cartman is an Elvis impersonator, Kyle is a tough dude with nose ring and Fu Manchu mustache]
Stan
Hey, Cartman, what does "fingerbang" mean, anyways?
Cartman
I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you... [waves his finger around] pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
Kenny
[chuckling] (Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)
Stan
Kenny says that's not what it means.
Cartman
[testy] Okay, Kenny, what does "fingerbang" mean, then?
Kenny
(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)
Cartman
...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
South Park Mall, day. South Park is not so small anymore. Two guards on the second floor relax against a glass railing
Veteran Guard
[with a drawl] Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous.
Cartman
[leading the band members through the mall] Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
Veteran Guard
[blocking the way to Mall Management] Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?
Cartman
We're goin' to see the mall manager.
Veteran Guard
Do you have the proper clearance?
Stan
[to Kyle] Uh oh, mall cops.
Veteran Guard
You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir.
Cartman
[pleading] But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do, [the veteran guard pulls out a small bottle of pepper spray and shakes it up] so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the-- [the veteran guard sprays his face all over] Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-dammit..! [squeezes his eyes shut and rubs them]
Kyle
Jesus Christ!
Cartman
Oh, God, I can't see! [rubs his eyes]
Veteran Guard
Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again. [Cartman walks off and the others join him. Stan retrieves the boom box. Then] You see, you put your life on the line every day.
Stan
Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager.
Cartman
[coughs a few times] The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! [all join him down the mall]
South Park Mall, later. The two guards are watching shoppers move along. A blond man with two bags walks by.
Veteran Guard
Ey! [the man turns to look at him] What are you doin'?
Man
Nothin'. Just... shopping.
Veteran Guard
Move along, sir. [the man leaves and the veteran looks at the rookie] You see, sometimes you gotta just do that. Keeps shoppers on their toes — try it. [the rookie gets determined and a woman and girl walk by]
Rookie Guard
Ey! [they turn to look at him] What are you doin'?
Woman
Nothing. Why?
Rookie Guard
Move along, ma'am. [she leaves looking angry]
Veteran Guard
That's what being a mall cop is all about. Hyeuup.
Rookie Guard
Cool.
Cartman
[over the PA system] Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. [crowds rush off to get their Nissans]
Veteran Guard
Jesus, they're gonna start a riot! [both cops follow the crowd while Cartman and friends return to the mall manager's office]
Cartman
Alright, guys, here we go. [enters the office with the others] Hello, sir!
Manager
[a harried man who's speech is nearly emotionless with odd exclamations] What? Hey. Who are you? [the office is a bit unkempt. Stacks of paper here and there, hanging out of cabinet drawers, scraps on the floor and desk...]
Cartman
We... are Fingerbang!
Manager
O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
Cartman
We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
Manager
What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
Cartman
Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
Manager
Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?
Cartman
Alright! Let's do it, boys! [moves aside and sets the boom box down, then sets the tape to play. He returns to the group, and they begin. All of them are all off-key, They all sing too ahead of the music and Wendy's voice is squeaky and lags behind the others...]
Fingerbang
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
I'm goin' to fingerbang-bang you ever-y night

Cartman
[goes into his solo, and back into his dream]
And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--

Manager
[cuts him off] Alright, that's enough!
Cartman
--you're my fantasy, you fanta--

Manager
Thank you.
Cartman
[backs up into the band] Well, so can we play here?
Manager
What?? ...No.
Cartman
No??
Manager
Who?? No!
Cartman
Why not?!
Manager
Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?
Cartman
You don't think we're any good, do you?!
Manager
No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese.
Cartman
Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. [goes to get his boom box]
Manager
Wow. That was your best? [Cartman flashes an angry look at him, then walks off in a huff.]
South Park Mall, later. The five are sitting on a bench on the first floor
Kyle
Wow. I feel so rejected.
Stan
Yeah.
Veteran Guard
There you are! You're the hoodlums who got on the intercom and started an orange smoothie riot!
Stan
Uh-oh.
Veteran Guard
I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--
Kyle
Run for it! [the five bolt and rush out of there]
Veteran Guard
Go get 'em, rookie! [gives the rookie a stern look; the rookie just looks back]
Stan's house, later. Shelly's eating cereal, Sharon is at the sink. Randy enters
Randy
Where is Stan?
Sharon
Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band.
Randy
What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
Sharon
Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it.
Randy
And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! [turns around and walks out]
Shelly
Mom, what's up Dad's ass?
Sharon
It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now.
Chef's house. Cartman arrives and rings the bell
Chef
[opens the door and appears in a towel around his waist] Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric.
Cartman
[eyes downcast] Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
Chef
Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. [a blonde woman comes up behind Chef]
Cartman
I just don't know what I'm gonna do. [lets himself in] Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. [goes to the sofa and pulls out some Cheesy Poofs to eat]
Chef
[sits next to Cartman] Alright, Eric, what's the matter?
Cartman
Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean, [with feeling] I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? [the woman sits on Chef's left side and strokes his arm]
Chef
Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect.
Cartman
What's the Gomlich effect?
Chef
The law of physics that states, "If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."
Cartman
So how do boy bands use that?
Chef
All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy! [the blonde gets cross and scoots away; Chef quickly makes amends] Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. [she goes sweet on him again]
Cartman
Thanks!
Chef
You're welcome. Now, go away!
Cartman
Okay. [Chef watches as Cartman drops down and heads for the front door, exits...]
Chef
A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
Cartman
[outside] Cucumber in the pants. Got it. [and closes the door]
South Park Elementary, playground, day. Nine kids are there: the five band members and the four other girls in class. Cartman is talking to Bebe, Red, Annie, and Milly. He seems to have taken Chef's advice...
Cartman
Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, "Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!" Okay?
Bebe
Are we gonna get paid now, or after?
Cartman
I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. [Timmy sits in the cameraman's chair]
Timmy
Tiimmmaaayyy! [Cartman inches his way to the group sideways]
Kyle
Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
Cartman
Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. [the band walks across the ground in front of the girls]
Girls
[ad lib] Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.
Cartman
Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!
Timmy
Huhaaaaah!
Cartman
Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
Bebe
We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
Other Girls (Red, Annie, and Milly)
Yeah.
Cartman
Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
Girls
...Matt Lauer.
Cartman
...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
Bebe
Oh... Okay. [Cartman positions himself in front of them]
Cartman
Roll camera!
Timmy
Timmuh! [the band tries again]
Girls
AAAGGGGHHH! [the band scatters away from the screaming. Cartman falls, then gets up]
Cartman
Jesus Christ!
South Park Elementary, playground, later. The band is still shooting the video. Bebe and Red hug Cartman tightly.
Fingerbang
Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night

Cartman
Aaand cut! [music stops] Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
Bebe
Okay, so where's our money?
Cartman
Oh uh, Kyle has it. [the girls move to Kyle. Cartman walks away]
Randy
[arrives] Stanley, what the hell are you doing?
Stan
We are making a music video.
Randy
You get in the truck right now! [points at it]
Stan
Dad, I was just a--
Randy
[pointing] Get in the truck! [Stan walks to the truck dejected]
The road, the Marsh truck. Randy drives Stan home.
Stan
Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
Randy
Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.
Stan
Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
Randy
Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
Stan
No.
Randy
Well, maybe it's time.
Stan
Dad!
South Park Mall, late morning. The guards relax on the second floor railings. A stooped man with a clear vessel filled with a green substance walks past them
Veteran Guard
Ey! What are you doin'?
Madman
I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!
Veteran Guard
Move along, sir.
Madman
Wuh? [walks away]
Cartman
Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. [crowds of mall shoppers head for the orange smoothie machine]
Veteran Guard
God dammit! [he and the rookie give chase]
Cartman
[enters the manager's office] Hello again!
Manager
What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
Cartman
I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
Manager
Oh. What?
Cartman
[retrieves a TV cart with VCR and pops the VCR in. The video pops up] If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! [at first, only the boys' hats are seen, near the play elephants. The camera spins right, then down, and the girls' feet are seen. The camera spins up and left, and finally rests on Timmy]
Timmy
Timmiihh! [The camera turns left again and catches a glimpse of the girls, then ends up on Cartman, and zooms in on the cucumber]
Cartman
Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. [the camera gets a glimpse of the four girls, then moves off them a second after Cartman appears]
Timmy
Haaghh. [waves at the camera, then moves his wheelchair back and dances to the music] Timmih, livin' a lie!
Cartman
Son of a bitch!
Manager
Hey. This video is dumb.
Cartman
[dead air on tape] You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
Manager
Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side. [gives a warning face] For a little while.
Cartman
Really? You will?
Manager
Only for twenty minutes, though.
Cartman
That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
Manager
Oh. Okay. [static shows up on the video]
Cartman
Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! [a previous recording is shown:]
Mr. Mackey
Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? [he's handcuffed against a brick wall. Mrs. Cartman appears as a dominatrix]
Liane
You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. [points to it, then spreads her legs and pisses into it as he watches]
Mr. Mackey
Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? [Cartman is shocked at what he sees; the manager is pleased]
Cartman
Aw, Mom!
Manager
Wow. What?
Marsh residence, later. Stan sits on the sofa as Randy paces the floor back and forth
Stan
It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?
Randy
Because I said so!
Stan
Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
Randy
Let 'em be pissed off, then!
Stan
I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--
Randy
No!! [walks over to the china cabinet] NOOO!! [smashes his head through its glass doors, causing the dishes to slide out and break up. Stan is distraught, and Randy stands up, ashamed and shocked at his behavior. He walks back to Stan, then turns away defeated]
Stan
Dad? What the hell is going on?
Randy
...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver. [a flashback starts. A young Randy is at lower left corner of the choir, and the choir begins this song: "Everything will wait / Weave all ye little reins..."] I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. [the audience claps. The producer is in the second row of spectators. The choir members split up and the producer rushes up to Randy]
Producer
Kid, can I talk to you?
Randy
Uh sure.
Producer
Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town.
Randy
Ohh, thanks.
Producer
Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
Randy
What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
Producer
Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?
Randy
Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
Producer
Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--
Randy
[interrupting] No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.
Producer
I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. [slips a business card into Randy's coat pocket and pats it]
Randy
And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
Randy
[walks by Denver High] See ya. [walks away]
Randy
...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
Randy
See ya. [waves, turns and walks away, leaving a distraught girl with mouth open]
Randy
...And I left my family.
Randy
See ya. [gets into his beat-up pale-yellow car and drives off, leaving his parents at the front door]
Randy
And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. [the five are recording their first song]
Producer
Take 112!
Ghetto Avenue Boys
You've... got... it!
You know you've got... it
[Randy: Girl]
What you've got is it!

Randy
It's obvious to me, girl

Randy
The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. [the song continues as he speaks, and the scene changes from the studio, to a poster, to a concert as the camera leaves the poster]
Ghetto Avenue Boys
Shirl! You've... got... it!
It... is what you've got, girl!
What you've got is it!

Randy
Now, give it to me, 'cause...

Randy
[more scenes from his glory days] I had everything. A huge house, [the backyard pool: he's resting on an inflatable chaise longue while women surround him] and all the women you can imagine. [nine bikini-clad women are in his bed, and he's rolling back and forth over all of them] And then one day, just as quick as it started...
Mr. Allens
[the Ghetto Avenue Boys enter to rehearse, but...] Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.
Randy
Hey, Mr. Allens.
Mr. Allens
Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.
RandyWho are they? [five new guys are in the recording booth]
1
Mr. Allens
These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band.
Randy
But, w-we're still selling records, right?
Mr. Allens
Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band.
Randy
I'm 19.
Mr. Allens
Get a life, Marsh! [the Ghetto Avenue Boys turn around and walk out the door] Alright, guys, let's take it from the top.
Randy
They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
Tow Truck Driver
[wearing a "Tacos" hat] See ya. [tows a blue sports car away]
Randy
...the women all left...
Women
See ya. [the women pour out of bed and leave]
Randy
...and they took back my house.
Randy
[gets kicked out of the house] Ugh..! [the producer stands at the French doors]
Mr. Allens
See ya. [Randy gets up and walks away]
Randy
The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
Woman
Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?
Man
Sure, I remember you! [starts mocking] You got it, baby... You got it, baby [he and the others begin to laugh, and it soon gets overwhelming. Randy looks around, scared. The flashback ends]
Randy
[voice full of emotion] And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.
Stan
Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
Randy
I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world. [Stan is listening] That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley. [bitterness creeps in] It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. [walks off]
Stan
[left with his thoughts] ...Oh-kay.
South Park Mall, afternoon. Most of Fingerbang is on the plaza stage, peeking out from behind a curtain with the band's name on it. People begin to gather in front of the stage.
Kyle
Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. [the band regroups]
Cartman
Where the hell is Stan?!
Kyle
He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
Cartman
I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
Manager
[approaches] Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?
Cartman
Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member.
Manager
Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. [the cart is shown with Swiss cheese and sausage, and a pissed-off vendor]
Cartman
Yeah. We'll start right away. [the manager walks away. Cartman turns to Kyle] We'll have to do it without him.
Kyle
Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Cartman
Oh, god-dammit!
Marsh residence, later. Randy is sitting at the foot of his bed, reading from an issue of Teen Heat dedicated to the band. The camera zooms out from the magazine cover to Randy reading
Stan
[enters] Dad?
Randy
Huh? Yeah?
Stan
Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
Randy
[thinks, then lowers the magazine] Come here, Stanley. [Stan approaches and sits next to his dad] Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.
Stan
Yeah.
Randy
You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
Stan
Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
Randy
Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.
Stan
Really?
Randy
Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
Stan
Alright! [father and son get up and leave the bedroom. Randy tosses his magazine aside]
South Park Mall, afternoon. Everyone is waiting for Fingerbang to sing
Man
What's happening here?
Woman
I don't know, uh. I guess nothing.
Man
Hm... Well, let's just walk away then. [man and woman leave]
Cartman
God dammit! People are walking away! [drops back behind the curtain]
Manager
[arrives again] Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart.
Cartman
Just another minute.
Manager
Sorry. Get out! [the band members walk sullenly away]
Cartman
[stops and looks up] Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
Wendy
[rushes up to Cartman and points] What's that? [a grinning Randy and Stan arrive in an elevator]
Kyle
It's Stan! [the other members have returned]
Cartman
Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! [walks off smiling as Stan arrives]
Kyle
Dude, where the hell have you been?!
Cartman
[approaches the manager] Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?
Manager
Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up.
Cartman
We will! [moves to the front of the stage and addresses the audience] Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, "I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall." [the manager takes offense] And so, without further ado, all five members of the...
Kenny
[while Cartman talks] (Uff--!) [an elevator crushes him and Cartman stops. Everyone around, including Cartman, is stunned. The doors open and the occupants exit]
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Cartman
[traumatized] No! He can't be dead!
Kyle
Dude, he's pretty dead.
Cartman
No! We were so close!
Manager
Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!
Cartman
But we have to perform!
Kyle
We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!
Stan
Oh, yes we do.
South Park Mall, later. The stage is set, the intro begins
Cartman
Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
Fingerbang
[the new fifth member: Randy]
Fingerbang!
Bang bang [audience members look at each other]
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang [people begin to leave]
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
[Janitors wearing face masks scrape Kenny's remains off the elevator]
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
[the veteran mall guard swivels his hips around happily as the rookie looks on]
I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
[Cartman: I'll just...]
Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night!

Cartman
Chuh! [only four shoppers remain to clap for them] Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
South Park Mall, later. Janitors continue cleaning the elevator that crushed Kenny, the sausage and cheese cart is rolled back on stage, and Fingerbang sits on the edge of the stage, dropping pieces of their costumes into the pit below
Kyle
We made two dollars.
Stan
You were great, Dad.
Randy
Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
Little Girl
Can I get your autograph?
Cartman
Ok-Okay, okay.
Veteran Guard
[arrives with the rookie and moves the girl aside] Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am.
Little Girl
[looks at the guard] I actually don't really know who they are, I was just getting an autograph and-- [the veteran guard sprays her with pepper] A-a-agg-g-ggh!
Veteran Guard
Move along, ma'am. [the little girl runs off stage] Eh, that was pretty good, kids. Maybe you can come perform at my Elks Club sometime.
Cartman
Okay, yeah, maybe. [the mall cops walk away] God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
Kyle
Yeah.
Cartman
I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', "Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"
Kyle
...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
Stan
Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
Randy
[looks at Stan and pats him on the back] Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. [gets up and moves off the stage]
Stan
I don't think they sell those anymore. [gets up and follows his dad off; Wendy gets up and follows him]
Kyle
Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? [gets up and follows the others off the stage. Cartman gets up and follows him]
Cartman
Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy. [the stage is empty now, but Cartman returns and looks up] You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. [turns and walks off again]
End of Something You Can Do with Your Finger

Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?
South Park, the church, day. The congregation is heard singing along with an organ. Inside, the town has assembled for services
Congregation
I walk hand-in-hand with Jesus
Over at the park by where he lives
I tell him all my problems
[the cantor is shown at the pulpit]
And sometimes he tells me his
What a friend I have in Jesus
[Stan, Kenny, and Cartman are shown]
I can say that honestly
[other townsfolk are shown]
He's not like all my other friends
Who really don't care about me.
Amen.

Stan
[to Kenny] Bo-ring.
Cantor
And now Mr. Mackey will read his favorite psalm for us, Psalm 46. [steps out of the way]
Mr. Mackey
Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay. [Cartman starts talking to Stan and Kenny] Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea...
Cartman
[as Mackey speaks] Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation. [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation." [stops]
Mr. Mackey
God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay. [Stan resumes conversing with the other two] Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place- [interrupted by the priest]
Stan
[as Mackey speaks] Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. "It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's..."
Cartman
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation [Stan and Kenny begin to laugh] to increase the population of the younger generation."
Kenny
(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
Cartman
No no, no. Separation.
Stan
"It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's-"
Priest Maxi
BOYS! You are in CHURCH! [Liane raises her arm and slaps Cartman across the back.]
Cartman
[falls off the pew and onto the floor] Ugh!
Mr. Mackey
-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay. [walks from the pulpit back to his seat. The priest replaces him]
Priest Maxi
Thank you, Mr. Mackey. Hello, everyone. Today, we're going to talk about hell. [an organ swells into a dreadful chord. The boys are afraid] Hell is not a very nice place. Burning, searing, flames. Screaming, torture. For eternity. Once you are in hell, you cannot escape. You live forever in horrible pain, in burning agony. All sinners are there in misery, dying over and over and over. [the camera begins to descend through the floor, past the foundation, several layers of dirt, a sewage pipe...] If you be cast down into this black bog of stench, then woe is thou, [...more layers of dirt and some fossils...] for Satan has made it the most miserable place in the universe! [...and finally, an inferno full of skulls] And he will be your ruler! [the camera stops at this sign: "Welcome to Hell"] Your ruler of pain and agony!
Hell. Music is heard, and the camera pans right, past this sign: "Don't Forget! IT'S LUAU SUNDAY!!!"
Singers:
Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
[Satan joins them]
Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
[Jerry Garcia is seen]
Everybody loves a hukilau-

Gene Siskel
I do!
Singers
Where the laulau is the kaukau at the luau
[A monster band plays]
We throw our nets out into the sea
[Satan does throw out a net]
And all the ama-ama come swimmin' to me
[two demons retrieve the net, with fish in it]
Are we going to the Hukilau?
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?

Hula Dancers
Are we going to the Hukilau?

Men
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?

Hula Dancers
Everybody loves a Hukilau,
[a hula dancer's head falls off]

Singers
Where the laulau is the kaukau at the luau
[Three other tortured souls watch as Satan and George Burns meet at the spit and Satan roasts the man attached]

All
'We throw our nets out into the sea.
[Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin motion for the nets to be dropped]
And all the ama-ama come a-swimming to me
[The demons harvest the catch, Tiny Tim surfs and plays his ukulele]
Are we going to the Hukilau?
[A three-person band of monsters sings and plays, then a group shot of Satan and others]
The Huki Huki Huki Huki Hukilau?
Huki... Luki... Lau?...
[the camera pulls back to show everyone. An Aloha sign appears above.]

Satan
Yeah!
Demon
Hennnh! [bites a damned soul]
Man
Aaawwwwwww! [the others laugh]
Gary
Great luau, Satan.
Satan
Thanks. See ya, Gary. Thanks for comin'. Oh- Hi, Marsha.
Walter
Satan, a few of us are gonna go pound some brews. You wanna join us?
Satan
Oh, I'd love to, Mr. Matthau, but I can't. Chris and I just moved to the west side and we have to unpack.
Walter
Oh, well, maybe next time. Great luau!
Satan
Bye.
Hell, a marina. Boats, yachts, and one big ship are docked on the liquid lava below. A complex of buildings is shown. A woman somewhere screams. At the main entrance the sign reads, "RIVER STYX CONDOMINIUMS. UNITS STILL AVAILABLE." Inside his condo, Satan sets up a ceramic doll display and hums a bit
Satan
Chris?
Chris
[off-screen] Yeah?
Satan
Did you, uh, see my "Boy With An Umbrella" Hummel?
Chris
Uuh, no, but there's still some boxes coming from the movers.
Satan
Oh, okay, thanks. [the doorbell rings.] Oh, that must be them now. [goes to answer the door, and opens it] Just put the boxes by the-
Saddam
Hello, Satan! [opens his arms wide and grins big. He has two suitcases, one on either side of him]
Satan
[stunned] Saddam...
Saddam
[cuddly] Did you miss me, buttercup?
Satan
No, it can't be! You're dead! I killed you!
Saddam
Yeah, you killed me. So? Where was I gonna go? Detroit?
Satan
Oh no. [looks up] Oh, God no.
South Park, the church, day. Priest Maxi finishes his sermon. Fear is shown across the faces of many of the congregants
Priest Maxi
A place of everlasting agony and pain! Hell awaits all sinners and all who do not accept Christ! [Stan grits his teeth, Cartman's jaw drops, Kenny trembles a little] Children in this town have not been attending Sunday school after Mass! And adults have not been coming to Confession! If this does not change, I promise you, you will be going to the black pit of Satan's world! [Cartman grits his teeth] That is all. Peace be with you. [congregants rise and file out of church. Randy and Sharon Marsh are the last two adults out]
Randy
Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon.
Sharon
Yeah. [Stan, Cartman, and Kenny run up to them from behind]
Stan
Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.
Sharon
[she, Liane, and Randy spin around] What?
Stan
We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! [turns around, runs to the altar, and turns right. Kenny follows him]
Cartman
Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. [runs out after the other two.]
Randy
Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.
Priest Maxi
[comes up behind them] Hell is a very real place, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. I'm trying to save their souls and the souls of everyone in this town from the wretched lake of fire!
The wretched lake of fire — I mean, Hell, the River Styx Condominiums, Satan's front door. Satan has taken refuge behind the door and peeks out
Saddam
Come on, guy. Just let me in so we can talk.
Satan
I don't want to talk to you, Saddam! This isn't what I need in my life right now.
Chris
[peeks out from another room] Is that the movers, Satan?
Satan
[hides his disdain] Ah. Yeah. Yeah, it's just the movers
Chris
Oh, well, tell them I'm leavin' their check on the counter. [disappears]
Satan
Okay, Chris.
Saddam
Satan, look: I know our relationship wasn't perfect. Okay? I know that. I was too busy tryin' to take over the world to give you what you needed. But I've changed, Satan. [flashes his charm]
Satan
[sarcastically] Oh, why, I haven't heard that one before.
Saddam
COME ON, can't we just go out for a burrito? [Satan thinks about it. Saddam appears dressed for a fiesta and shakes the maracas around] ¡Me gusta burrito mucho!
Satan
I can't, Saddam. I'm with Chris now.
Saddam
Who?? Screw 'im! He can't pound your ass like I can!
Satan
Good-bye, Saddam!
Saddam
Wait. Wait, I'm sorry, heh. But Satan, you can't deny what's between us. [pats his hair] You can try, but you know we belong together.
Satan
My life is good now, Saddam. Chris treats me well. You and I are through. Good-bye. [closes the door, sighs, and walks off to his left, past a window]
Saddam
[pops up outside the window] Hey, come on, guy! Give me a break! [Satan looks, then lowers the blinds, and continues walking]
South Park, the church, day. Sunday school is in session, apparently at the church basement. A nun and eleven children sit around a table. Clockwise: the nun, a blonde girl, Clyde, Butters, Token, Kenny, Stan, Cartman, Pip, Bebe, Tweek, and a blond boy. A Twister game in on one side of the room, a bicycle on the other
Nun
Hello, children. I'm Sister Anne. And I'll be teaching you so that you can all receive your First Communion.
Stan
[quite afraid] Are we gonna go to hell?
Sister Anne
Well, hopefully not. That's why you're gonna need to receive Communion.
Cartman
A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
Stan
What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
Cartman
Yeah, what if we haven't?
Sister Anne
It doesn't matter, because we are all born with Original Sin. Now, let me explain how Communion works. [brings out a golden dish with round wafers on it] The priest will give you this round cracker, [lifts up and displays a wafer] and he will say, "The Body of Christ," and then you eat it. [silence]
Cartman
Jesus was made of crackers?
Sister Anne
No.
Stan
But crackers are his- body.
Sister Anne
Yes.
Kenny
[thinks a while, then] (What?!)
Sister Anne
In the Book of Mark, Jesus distributed bread and said, "eat this, for it is my body."
Cartman
So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
Sister Anne
Nononono!
Butters
Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?
Sister Anne
The Body of Christ! [confused faces all around]
Stan
Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
Sister Anne
No!
Stan
No??
Butters
Huh-I can't whistle if I eat too many crackers.
Sister Anne
Look: all you have to know is that when the priest gives you the cracker, you eat it! Okay?!
Kenny, Stan, Cartman
O-kay.
Sister Anne
And then, you will drink a very small amount of wine, for that, is the Blood of Christ.
Cartman
[unconvinced, closes his Bible] Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! [rests his head on his left hand]
Sister Anne
Eric, do you wanna go to hell?!
Cartman
[startled] Nno!
Sister Anne
Then stop questioning me.
Cartman
But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
Sister Anne
No. Because before you can take your first Communion, you have to have your first Confession.
Stan
Confession? [Kenny snaps to attention, jarring music plays in the background]
Sister Anne
You'll be getting in the Confession box with a priest and confessing all your sins, so that God can forgive you. You kids will all have to go to your first Confession this Tuesday, so I want you all to go home tonight and think long and hard about all your sins, so that you can tell the priest everything. [All the kids look towards Stan Kenny and Cartman, who's faces are stricken with fear]
Kenny
(OH, SHIT!)
Hell, the River Styx Condominiums, Satan's kitchen. He and Chris are washing dishes. He soaks, Chris rinses
Chris
Those were some great pork chops, Satan.
Satan
Yeah.
Chris
Hey, you. [puts a dish away] You've been actin' strange all night. What's up?
Satan
[jittery] Nothing. Why?
Chris
Well, it's... just that you've washed that same dish seven times now, silly.
Satan
[sheepish] Oh, huh. Sorry, huh-huh. [holds a plate in his hands, then gives it to Chris]
Chris
[puts it away] Come on, Satan. You know you can tell me anything. What's up?
Satan
Well, Chris, Saddam showed up today.
Chris
[stung] Oh. [thinks] Woww! [sighs] I wasn't ready for that.
Satan
He showed up spouting all kinds of things about how he's changed and he still loves me...
Chris
I thought you... killed him.
Satan
Yeah, well, where was he gonna go? Detroit?
Chris
...Do you still love him?
Satan
No, Chris.
Chris
It's okay of you do.
Satan
Well, I mean- [sighs] Of course, there's a part of me that will always love him, I... But I also know how abusive he was—I'm much happier with you.
Chris
Well, you know what I think we should do? I think we should all get together and just talk, like adults.
Satan
What?
Chris
We're all grown men here, Satan. I wanna just go meet this guy.
Satan
No, Chris, you don't understand. Saddam is fucking crazy.
Chris
Oh, I know he's got the whole bad-boy thing going. But I think that's what you were attracted to. But I can be a pretty rough tumbler myself. [tosses a plate into the air. It falls onto the floor and breaks up, startling him] Oops! [bends down to pick up the pieces.] Aw, butternuts! [Satan just glances away]
South Park, curbside. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny are seated there. Cartman has pen and notebook in hand
Stan
Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
Cartman
Oh yeah, okay.
Stan
And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
Cartman
Right, I already got that one.
Kyle
[stops by] Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?
Stan
We're trying to remember all our sins. Sister Anne told us we have to confess all our sins or else we're gonna go to hell.
Kyle
Uhwuwhat?
Stan
Have you confessed all your sins yet?
Kyle
No-o-o-o-o!
Cartman
Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
Kyle
Oh good. I don't?
Cartman
No, you're already going to hell.
Kyle
I am not!
Cartman
You are, too!
Stan
Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
Kyle
I'm gonna go ask my mom! [walks away]
Stan
Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
Cartman
Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
Kenny
(What?)
Butters
[rushes in with Timmy and Token] Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
Stan
What, Butters?
Butters
Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
Timmy
Timmiih!
Cartman
What'd we do to Timmy?
Butters
No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
Timmy
Timmiih!
Cartman
Oh yeah, you're right. I guess Timmy's pretty screwed.
Stan
Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
Kenny
(What are we gonna do?)
Stan
I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
Hell. Satan sits on a boulder with four demons and a small monster off to his left
Satan
[pensive] I don't know what I'm gonna do. I can't deny my feelings for Saddam, but... my life is so much better now with Chris. [the monster gives him some commentary in gibberish] Yeah. It's like Chris is so perfect in every way, but there's just something about Saddam that I'm more attracted to. [the monster makes a suggestion] In what way? [the monster tells him] Yeah, you're right. Saddam would just treat me bad again. I'm just gonna have to not see Saddam. Put him out of my mind and focus on Chris. If I don't see Saddam, then I won't have such strong feelings for him. Thanks guys. [turns right to walk away]
Chris
[arrives] There you are.
Satan
[turns right] Oh hi, Chris!
Chris
I've been lookin' all over for you. I have to tell you somethin' that might make you... a little mad.
Satan
What?
Chris
Well, I called Saddam Hussein and invited him over for dinner tonight.
Satan
You WHAT?!
Chris
I just think we all need to get this out in the open.
Satan
Oh, Chris! Rraarr! [raises his arms in fury and points his right hand away. Lightning comes out from his index finger and scorches a tree.] Rraahh! [points his left hand away. Lightning comes out from his index finger and scorches the aboriginal monster he was talking with earlier.]
Chris
[walks up to Satan] Come on, Satan. We're all adults here. He was an important person in your life, for better or for worse. So, I wanna know him. If he sees that I'ma real person too, then... well, maybe he'll see how happy we are together.
Satan
No, Chris! He'll try to kill you is what he'll do!
Chris
Satan, we're not in junior high school anymore.
Satan
[incredulous] Oh, dear God. [slaps his hand to his face]
South Park, the church. Stan sits on a bench praying. A confession box stands nearby with two doors, one of which is open. Apparently, he's already confessed his sins.
Stan
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
Cartman
[approaches] How was it?
Stan
Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!
Cartman
Huh?
Stan
The guy in there said I have to say 54 Hail Marys. Now I can't remember if I was on number seven or eight.
Cartman
Who's in there?
Stan
I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
Cartman
Well, here goes everything. [walks to the penitent side of the confession box and enters.]
The confessional, inside. Cartman sits and faces the partition.
Cartman
[hesitantly] Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
Priest Maxi
[in the confessor's side] Blessed art thou, child. Now, what do you have to confess?
Cartman
Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
The church, inside, next to the confessional. Stan continues his prayers
Stan
...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Ble-
Kenny
[arrives] (Hey, dude.)
Stan
God damnit!
Kenny
(What??)
Stan
[notices someone and points] Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy. [he and Kenny walk over to her. She's kneeling before a table of candles and a portrait of Jesus] Sister Anne?
Sister Anne
Oh, hello, children.
Stan
We have a question.
Sister Anne
[rises] Okay, shoot.
Stan
Where do handicapped people go when they die?
Sister Anne
[thinks a moment, then] The handicapped are just people like you and me, so the same rules apply. They need to be baptized, take Communion, and confess their sins.
Stan
But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
Sister Anne
Uugh. This really isn't a question for me, it's for the priest. [begins to hurry away] I'll see if I can find him. Bye. [Stan and Kenny look at each other]
The confessional, inside. Cartman goes through his extensive list of sins
Cartman
And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
Priest Maxi
Your [clears his throat] con- confession does not leave this box.
Cartman
Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
Priest Maxi
[guarded] Oh. Well, Uh arr-I'm sure he would forgive you if he knew.
Cartman
No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. [Cartman looks up for a response, but nothing happens]
Priest Maxi
[after a pause] I... see.
Cartman
Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week. [the priest grows more concerned and his jaw drops] And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog. [Priest Maxi's worry has turned to anger he's trying to contain] And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of- [an arm tears through the partition and grabs Cartman by the throat] -eh- Ow! [throttles him back and forth] D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow! [the priest pulls him up into the partition a few times] Eh! Oh! Help. [The confession box rocks back and forth] Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
Sister Anne
[arrives and knocks on the priest's door as Cartman screams] Father! I need to talk to you. Father! [an angry Priest Maxi exits the box] I have to ask you a question.
Priest Maxi
Okayokay, fine! [walks away with Sister Anne]
Cartman
[the door opens and he falls to the floor] Uh-huh- [Stan and Kenny rush up] Oho! Ohoho.
Stan
What happened??
Cartman
I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God. [Stan and Kenny get afraid] He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
Hell, River Styx Condominiums. The doorbell rings at Satan and Chris's condo. Chris walks to the door and opens it
Chris
Oh, hello. You must be Saddam Hussein.
Saddam
And you must be Mr. Assface. [cocks his head in an open grin] Just kidding. You're Chris, right? Thanks for inviting me to dinner, guy. [reaches into his coat] Here, I brought you a potato. [hands him a baked potato still wrapped in aluminum foil]
Chris
[takes the potato] Oh, thank you.
Satan
[sees this and rushes up to Chris] Chris, no! It's a bomb! [takes the potato and chucks it clear of the condo]
Chris
Satan, what the heck is wrong with you?
Saddam
Yeah! Hey, relax, guy. We're all here to act like adults, right? [the potato explodes in a manner that reveals it was a bomb after all] Oh, gee. I guess I must've overcooked it. [chuckles]
Chris
Well, come on in. Dinner's just about ready.
The Broflovski house, day. Sheila and Gerald sit on the living room sofa, and Ike reads from a book between them
Ike
behayin' glah, and the he find de eye. [reads from "Cannery Row" by John Steinbeck]
Gerald
Very good, Ike. That's two John Steinbeck books in one day.
Ike
Cookie monstooh.
Sheila
[affectionately] Oh, he's growing up so fast! [a door opens and closes]
Kyle
[rushes into the room] Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
Sheila
Why? What did you do, Kyle?!
Kyle
Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
Sheila
Oh noooo, that's just Catholics. Us Jews don't believe in hell.
Kyle
We don't? But what if we're wrong?
Sheila
Well..., Kyle..., they could be wrong, too.
Kyle
Yeah, but if they're wrong, no big deal. If we're wrong, we burn in hell.
Ike
Oh, no.
Gerald
Kyle, it's all about being a good person now! You see, Christians use hell as a way to scare people into believing what they believe. But to believe in something just because you're afraid of the consequences if you don't believe in something is no reason to believe in something. Understand?
Ike
No-o-o.
Kyle
Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! [goes up to him and takes him away towards the front door. The book falls to the floor]
Sheila
Kyle!
Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Dinner has been served. Saddam, Satan, and Chris sit at a round table, eating. Satan sits between the other two.
Chris
So Saddam. Satan told me all about how you guys almost took over the world once.
Saddam
Hn-yeah, those were the days, boy. What the hell is this crap we're eating, anyway?
Satan
It's all vegetarian, Saddam. Chris was a nutritionist before he died.
Saddam
Oh, isn't that fascinating. So, tell me, Chris. How is it that you died?
Chris
Oh, well I, I actually slipped down an escalator, in a mall. Those things can be pretty sketchy.
Saddam
An escalator? What kind of pussy way of dying is that?!
Chris
L-look, Saddam, I know that you and Satan had a relationship [Saddam reaches down to stroke Satan's right leg] And I just want you to know [Satan swats Saddam's arm away] that I'm totally okay with you guys staying friends.
Saddam
Uh huh.
Chris
I think it's important to stay friends with people you've had relationships with. [Saddam tries twice more with Satan, but Satan keeps swatting Saddam's arm off] And I know that Satan and my relationship is strong enough that it can handle anything. [looks up to Satan] Right? [a tormented Satan looks down at a grinning Saddam, who is still stroking his leg] Right.
The church, day. The rectory. Sister Anne, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny wait for Priest Maxi at his desk. On one side of the desk is a tray with holders that say, "The LORD Giveth" and "The LORD Taketh"
Sister Anne
Father, the children asked me about their handicapped friend. I wanna explain to them that he's fine.
Priest Maxi
Well, has your friend ever confessed or been baptized?
Stan
I don't think so.
Priest Maxi
Then, hell awaits him.
Sister Anne
Father, these boys are really worried because they think they have to-
Priest Maxi
They SHOULD be worried! Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!
Sister Anne
Yes, but-
Kyle
[rushes in with Ike in tow] Mister Father! [Sister Anne looks back at him] We have to ask you something.
Priest Maxi
Oh. You're the little Jewish boy, right?
Kyle
Yeah. If we're Jewish, are we gonna go to hell?
Priest Maxi
Well, young man, you can rest assured that according to Matthew 25, when you die you will stand before God and he will will say, "Depart from me, you cursèd, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels." Yes! As a Jew, your home will be the lake of fire.
Ike
[hiding behind a frightened Kyle] Oh no.
Sister Anne
Father-
Priest Maxi
I hope to see all of you in church this Sunday.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny
We will be. [the boys turn and walk out with Ike. Priest Maxi gloats]
Sister Anne
[concerned] Father, I don't know if I agree fully with what you're saying. I think that as long as Jewish people are good, they will get into heaven.
Priest Maxi
Sister, the Jews crucified our Savior. I mean, if you don't go to hell for crucifying the Savior, then what the hell do you go to hell for?!
The church, day. The boys stand in front of the candle table Sister Anne prayed at earlier
Kyle
[breathless] Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
Stan
Alrightalrightalright. You heard the priest: the first thing we have to do is get you guys all baptized. Come on. [the boys exit]
Cartman's house, day. Timmy, Kyle, and Ike stand in a row as a hose splashes on each one for a few seconds. Cartman is the one doing the spraying while Stan and Kenny watch from the steps
Stan
Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.
Cartman
[points the hose at Kyle] Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
Kyle
HAAAAH!
Cartman
Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
Stan
Cartman!
Cartman
What?
Stan
Dude, you just said "ass"! That's a sin!
Cartman
Oh, now you've said it, too!
Stan
Oh, shit! [covers his mouth with his gloves.] Oh!
Kenny
(Fuck! Oops!) [covers his own mouth]
Cartman
Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
Stan
But what about them?
Cartman
Ugh. Oh, I know. [runs away, but returns with an attachment] We can use Wacky Water Weasel! [sets everything up, and the Weasel sets to work spraying Timmy, Kyle, and Ike.]
Timmy
Haaaaah!
Stan
Okay, come on. [he, Cartman, and Kenny leave]
Timmy
Haaa-ay, Timmmiih!
Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Dinner is over. Chris collects the dishes
Chris
Hoof. Well, I don't know about you guys, but all that ginger made me tired.
Saddam
Yes. I guess I should be gettin' back. [leaves the table]
Satan
Good. I'll show you out.
Chris
Nice to meet you, Saddam! Have a safe walk back!
Saddam
Yeah. Thanks for the weak grass and twigs and stuff. [Satan shows him out; he faces Satan] Satan, that guy is a pussy!
Satan
He's stable, Saddam!
Saddam
Yes, that's what I said! He's a pussy!
Satan
Having stability in your life is a great thing! You should try it!
Saddam
For some people, maybe. But you like excitement. I know you, Satan. [grins]
Satan
I'm very happy with my life now.
Saddam
Here. [slips a key into Satan's hand] I'm at the bargain hotel on Monte Vista. Room 16.
Satan
No, Saddam! I won't be needing this!
Saddam
D'oh, I know you won't. But just keep it, just in case. It was good seeing you again, Satan. Goodnight. [to Chris, still inside the condo] Goodnight, pussy! I mean, Chris!
Chris
[off screen] Goodnight [Satan looks torn]
Rome, St. Peter's Square. A phone rings somewhere and someone answers
Voice
Hello. Your Excellency? [the scene switches to the church in South Park. The voice is Sister Anne's] This is Sister Anne, the Bleeding Eyes of Jesus, calling from the United States?
Secretary
Yes, I understand you want to speak-a wit the pope.
Sister Anne
Yes. The priest here has been telling the children some pretty radical things, and I just wanted to see what the Church thinks about Jews and the mentally handicapped.
Secretary
Yes, well the pope is here, but please keep it brief. He is a-very old. [the secretary hands the phone over to the pope, who is seated in a throne inside a tiny temple at one end of the cathedral]
The Pope
Heh??
Sister Anne
Hello, His Holiness. I want to ask you about people with mental disabilities.
The Pope
Heh?
Sister Anne
Do mentally-challenged people go to hell?
The Pope
[soft] Ehhhhh, what's that you say? [loud] Heh?!
Sister Anne
[enunciates] Handicap. Mental handicap.
The Pope
[flaps his lips around with his tongue] Fibibiibibibibiibibih.
Sister Anne
[waits, then] ...The priest here said that people with mental handicaps might end up in hell. Is that true?
The Pope
[snores, then] Eh-bibibiibibibibiibibibih. [Sister Anne says nothing.]
South Park Avenue, day. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny are at a crosswalk waiting for the light to turn green
Stan
Come on! This stupid light won't change.
Token
[arrives, followed by Butters, Clyde, and Bebe] Come on! Hurry up! [sees the other three boys] Hey, what are you guys doin'?
Stan
We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
Butters
Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
Clyde
Yeah. If we died right now, we'd have unclean souls and we'd burn in hell. [the crosswalk light turns green]
Stan
Uh, come on, let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but...]
Kenny
(Yow!) [a tour bus slams into Kenny and takes him away. The other kids freeze where they are, petrified]
Stan
[finally reacts, shrilly] ...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Butters
He had sins that he didn't confess!
Cartman
And he never took Communion!
Stan
He's doomed.
Clyde
...We've gotta get to that church before we die.
Cartman
Yeah. [the kids make their way slowly across the street]
Hell, River Styx Condominiums, night. Satan and Chris are in bed in the dark. Chris is trying to arouse Satan, but Satan doesn't move
Chris
[grabbing Satan's privates] Yeah. [moves up to Satan's left shoulder] That's hot. [then to the right one] You take it! [Satan turns on the lights as Chris makes his way down to his crotch] You take it now!
Satan
Chris, what are you doing?
Chris
I'm just... I'm just trying to be a little more naughty in bed. I uh... I know that's what you like about sex with Saddam. I'm just... showin' you that I can be that way, too.
Satan
Oh boy.
Chris
[resumes his naughtiness] Uh huh. Yeah. You like that, don't you, bitch? [Satan begins to grimace] I'm a bad boy. Yeah. Take that.
Satan
Chris, just... don't... don't do that.
Chris
But it turns you on.
Satan
No, it's a- When Saddam did it, yeah, but uh...
Chris
But what?
Satan
Nothing. I just- I'm just- really tired is all. Can we- just, please go to sleep? [Chris looks let down] Chris, seriously. I'm just tired, okay?
Chris
[closes his eyes] Okay. I love you, Satan.
Satan
I love you too, Saddam.
Satan, Chris
[immediately react] Wuh?!
Satan
Waw. Uhuh. I'm sorry, I mean, Chris. [grimaces]
Chris
It's okay. It's okay. I, uh, I, I understand. ...I do.
Satan
I just need to go get some air. okay? I'll be back... really quick. [gets out of bed and leaves]
Chris
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
South Park, the church, day. The kids race towards the church
Cartman
Come on, hurry up! [Stan reaches the door]
Stan
[tries to open it] Oh no! It's locked!
Cartman
[moves in and tries to open it] What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
Butters
Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. [the kids go around to the back of the church, find the window, and climb in]
Stan
[sees something off to the side] Confession box is over there! [moves towards it]
Cartman
I'm first, I'm first! [trips Token and runs past Stan. Token quickly gets up and walks with the others. Cartman opens the penitent door and sees a woman with her exposed ass up against the partition]
Woman
Oh, huhuh.
Cartman
[closes the door] What the? [opens the priest's door. Priest Maxi, in a sexual act with the woman on the other side, looks out and grins. The kids look back in horror, and his face changes]
Priest Maxi
Whoa! [turns and faces the partition while zipping up his pants] Son of a bitch!
Woman
[flits out of the penitent side] Eh, heheheheheheh.
Priest Maxi
[exits] Uhuh. Kids, uh.
Stan
You're a sinner!
Cartman
You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
Priest Maxi
Oh! Huh huh. Huh huh. [drops to his knees and prays] Oh, forgive me, heavenly Father! I've sinned against you!
Cartman
Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
Priest Maxi
M-Mrs. Donovan is a temptress from hell! [begins to weep]
Stan
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Cartman
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
Hell. Satan walks down its streets
Damned Soul
Oh, the pain! Oh, the pain! [Satan stops and looks at the key Saddam gave him. The handle looks like a coffin]
Satan
[lowers the key] No, I can't. [in front of him is the Bargain Hotel] What am I doing? I know this is the wrong thing to do. I could lose Chris. I can't do this. [turns around and walks away] I can't do this. [stops and turns back]
South Park, day. A street corner. Cartman holds court on a soapbox. At least 17 other kids surround him. Some adults look at the action from across the street
Cartman
We have-uh repeatedly broken God's commandments-uh! We have lived our lives for ourselves-uh! Totally ignoring the Lord-uh! [Chef and Mr. Garrison arrive] If thy hand offend thee, cut it off! [Stan's parents and the nun are there] It is much better for thee to enter into life maimed-
Randy
Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
Cartman
Sister Anne
[steps up] Oh no.
Cartman
Stan
[passes out material] Pamphlet. Pamphlet. [from a child's view, the pamphlet is seen. It's called "Kids Against Hell" and has a quote from Ezekiel 5:10. It is soon lowered for a good shot at the growing crowd of kids at the street corner]
Cartman
There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
Girl
I don't wanna to go to hell. [joins the kids, leaving her parents stunned]
Cartman
It will be a long road, but at the end of that road is Salvation! And I am going to lead you there!
End of Do The Handicapped Go To Hell? — To Be Continued...
End of Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?

Probably
'Recap:
Priest Maxi is shown at the church podium before the congregation
Announcer
Previously on South Park...
Priest Maxi
Today, we are going to talk about hell. [an organ swells into a dreadful chord. The boys are afraid]
Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Saddam appears at Satan's door
Saddam
Hello, Satan! [opens his arms wide and grins big. He has two suitcases, one on either side of him]
Satan
[stunned] Saddam...
Broflovski residence. Sheila and Kyle are talking
Sheila
Us Jews don't believe in hell.
Kyle
But what if we're wrong?
South Park Avenue, day. The kids begin crossing the street
Stan
Let's go. [the kids begin to cross the street, Kenny first, but a tour bus slams into Kenny and takes him away. The other kids freeze where they are, petrified]
Stan
[finally reacts, shrilly] ...they've killed Kenny!
Butters
He had sins that he didn't confess!
Hell, River Styx Condominiums, dinner. Saddam tries to arouse Satan under the table. Satan swats Saddam's arm away
Satan
No, Saddam, I told you. I'm with Chris now.
Church rectory. Priest Maxi is talking to the boys
Priest Maxi
Boys, it is your Christian duty to save the souls of your friends!
Hell, River Styx Condominiums, bedtime. Satan and Chris are in bed
Chris
[closes his eyes] I love you, Satan.
Satan
I love you too, Saddam.
Satan/Chris
[immediately react] Wuh?!
Pacific Ocean. A man drives a speedboat. Richie Cunningham, Ralph Malph, and Potsy Weber go along for the ride, and Arthur Fonzarelli stands behind the boat on water skis. Wait...
Richie
Fonz, there's no way you can jump that shark with your water skis. [A buoy ring contains a shark, and a larger red buoy warns "DANGER" in white letters]
Fonzie
Aaaay! I've gotta try, Richie.
Church confessional, day. Cartman opens the penitent door and sees a woman with her exposed ass up against the partition
Woman
Oh, huhuh. [Cartman opens the priest's door. Priest Maxi, in a sexual act with the woman on the other side, looks out and grins]
Stan
Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
Cartman
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save everyone in this town ourselves!
Beach. Richie, Potsy, Ralph, and Joanie are on the shore watching the boat driver take Fonzie on his stunt. On shore is a sign posted on a pair of surfboards that reads "GO FONZ!!!"
Joanie
Go Fonz!!!
Fonzie
Aaaaaa-- [the image freezes in place, so that Fonzie is suspended in mid-air]
Announcer
And now the exciting conclusion of... South Park.
Fonzie
[action resumes]—aaaaaayy-err. [lands inside the buoy ring; the shark catches and eats him live. The shark rises out of the water with Fonzie still in its mouth] No! [the shark drops and rises again] No! [...and again...] No! [a pool of blood develops inside the buoy ring] No!
Richie
I told him he couldn't do it. [the other three on shore look on stunned]
South Park Elementary, playground. Cartman stands on a platform and is preaching to the kids
Cartman
I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! [a group of adults gathers just outside the rear school doors. Kyle joins Cartman on the platform...]
Principal Victoria
["'Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! Oh, praise His name!"] You see that, parents? Your children have refused to come into class since this morning. I'm afraid your son is the leader, Ms. Cartman. ["But do you believe in the power of God?"] Apparently he's read the entire Bible, and now he's scaring the hell out of everyone.
Liane
[gently calls out] Boopie-kins. ["Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?"] It's time to stop preaching damnation to everyone, sweetie. [Cartman stops]
Stan
[joins Cartman on the platform] Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
Kids
Yeah!
Sharon
We are not trying to persecute you kids, but you're supposed to be in school.
Stan
What purpose does school have? The Bible says the only goal in this life is to praise God and get into heaven.
Kyle
Yeah, this life is short. The afterlife is forever.
Principal Victoria
Don't listen to them, kids. You have to go to school.
Cartman
Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was [throws himself down face-first] smacked down by the Lord-uh! [rises] God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh! [kids gasp, adults go glum] But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides, [Kyle has left and now returns with an easel with a picture of a church on it] so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya [near the top of the left-side wall] to this part hmya. [the grass down below] Who will help us?
Kids
[in unison] I will.
Cartman
Praise God-uh!
Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Satan is seen looking at the Bargain Hotel Saddam is in
Satan
If I go spend the night with Saddam, then it's over between me and Chris. [looks at Saddam's room key] Chris has been so nice to me and I know Saddam will just hurt me again. [looks at it again] M-maybe I'll just go talk to Saddam. I need closure, yeah. That's it, I need closure. [advances to the hotel, to room 16, then turns around with second thoughts] What am I doing? [takes a step when the room door opens]
Saddam
[in evening suit] What took yo so long, baby?
Satan
[turns around] Saddam, I'm just here to talk.
Saddam
Great! Let's talk! [Saddam enters. Saddam rushes to the bed and sits on it, stroking the covers] Hmm, this bed is comfy-bumpy.
Satan
Saddam, I only came here because I need closure.
Saddam
Sounds fun. You know me, I'll try anything.
Satan
No! Saddam, listen to me.
Saddam
Would you like a drink?
Satan
Um, maybe just... a little one. [Saddam serves him a drink] I have to go back soon. I need you to understand that we can't be together anymore. [Satan turns on the TV and a video of a group of men is shown. A sheriff lowers his pants before a kneeling skinhead. Other men are singing, chanting, moaning] I need you to not come by the condo and not try to see me. Chris thinks we can all be friends, but I don't. And I have to focus on Chris now. [just now notices the video] What is this?
Saddam
These hotels have all kinds of crazy channels.
Satan
Saddam, will you listen to me?! Chris is a great person. He's the one I wanna be with now.
Saddam
[knowingly] Really? So then... What are you doing here? [Satan has no answer. He just looks down and away] Well, I don't know about you, but this video is gettin' me pretty hot!
Satan
[hurt] Saddam...
Saddam
Here, have another drink. [Satan takes it and swallows it down]
Hell, Bargain Hotel, Saddam's room. Satan is sleeping away peacefully
Satan
[wakes up] Ooh, whoa... God, my head. Drank too much. [looks to his left] Chris? [the camera zooms out to show Saddam, dressed in leather straps, looking at him lovingly. Five different kinds of dildos and a whip are seen. Satan quickly sits up] Oh no!! [scans the room and sees more sex toys, including an auto club, an Antonio Banderas blow-up doll, a penis pump, and a goat tied to a lamp]
Saddam
[snuggling up] Man, look at that! We went through 14 bottles of vegetable oil! [tosses the last one off the bed.] Ewuh, I'm all greasy.
Satan
[leaves the bed] Oh God, what time is it?
Saddam
Last night was awesome! Are we together again now?
Satan
I don't know. I-I guess so, but now I have to go home and tell Chris.
Saddam
Screw him!!
Satan
No, Saddam! I at least owe him an explanation! [walks towards the door] I just don't know what I'm gonna say. [the door opens and closes. Satan is gone]
Saddam
I know how to solve this little problem.
Baja California coast, Mexico, day. The camera pans slowly to the right.
Driver
[off-screen] We are now entering Ensenada, the second largest city on the Mexican Baja Peninsula. [the tour bus is seen making its way through Ensenada] We have now traveled over 2000 miles since leaving New York City. We'll just be stopping here for a few moments for gas, and then our tour will continue onto its final destination. [two gas station attendants approach the bus. One of them notices something]
Attendant
Oiga. Hay algo pegado bajo el autobus. ["Listen. There's something stuck under the bus."]
Driver
'Kay. What's stuck to the bottom of the bus? [the attendant takes his mop and jabs at the bottom of the bus, and Kenny finally drops down]
Kenny
(Ahow..!)
Driver
Oh, goodness! We must have run over a little Mexican further up north. Is it okay? [Kenny sits up and shakes his dizziness off]
Attendant
Pienso que sí. ["I think so." Kenny stands up]
Driver
Well, here's fifty for the gas. [starts the bus and drives off] Adios.
Kenny
(Where am I?)
Attendant
¿Qué?
Kenny
(Where am I?)
Attendant
¿Qué?
South Park, day. Cartman's blueprint for his church is shown, then the camera pans right to show the actual construction. A bunch of kids work on the structure, using all sorts of things, including mirrors for wall panels.
Cartman
This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
Stan
There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
Kyle
Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
Gerald
[shows up with Sheila, behind the boys] Hello, boys. [they turn around]
Kyle
Don't try to take me away again, Mom and Dad! I told you! I renounced the Jewish faith!
Sheila
It's not that, Kyle. It's just that Eric's mother needs to see you all right away. [Stan, Cartman and Kyle look at each other, suspicious] Just really quick; she says it's very important.
Cartman
Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. [the boys turn left and walk towards Cartman's house]
Sheila
I sure hope this works.
Cartman residence, later. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle enter. Dialog from "Not Without My Anus," set to an organ and canned laughter, is heard as the boys make their way across a living room littered with toys of all sorts. The room is decorated so that the boys would forget their "mission" and just play for one afternoon. Liane shows up with a Cartman favorite.
Liane
Hello, kiddies. I made you all powdered doughnut pancake surprise.
Stan
Wow, cool.
Cartman
No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
Liane
What?
Cartman
This is a distraction from our work on the church! [grabs a doughnut] Do not think that you can tempt us with toys [takes a bite out of his doughnut] and new games [munches away] and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with! [finishes the doughnut off] Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
Stan
Yeah!
Liane
Oh. Well, [sets the dish on the sofa and walks away] alrighty then.
Kitchen, moments later. Liane enters. Sister Anne waits with Stan's and Kyle's parents
Liane
I... don't think it worked.
All
Aww.
Living room, moments later.
Cartman
Let us get back to our work at the church. [the phone rings] Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah. [answers it] Hello?
Kenny
[from a pay phone next to Papas & Beer in Ensenada] (Cartman?! Cartman, you've gotta help me, and I'm not foolin' around!)
Cartman
[grins mischievously, then] Oh my God!!
Stan
What?
Cartman
It's Kenny. He's calling from beyond the grave!
Stan
Kenny?! [move towards the phone] What's he say?
Kyle
[moves next to Stan] Ask him what hell is like.
Cartman
Kenny! You have to tell us about hell! Give us every last horrible detail!
Kenny
(Um...) [mariachi music is heard, and the street is lively enough]
Hell, River Styx Condominiums. Satan has returned, and is outside the door to his condo
Satan
Oh, God, Chris is gonna be so mad at me. Well, here it goes. [opens the door and enters. Chris is sitting alone on the sofa reading a book]
Chris
Hey, you.
Satan
Hi, Chris. [closes the door]
Chris
You... were out all night.
Satan
Yeah, I just... spent the night walking around the marina.
Chris
Satan. You know you're not a very good liar. You went and saw Saddam, didn't you?
Satan
[low voice] Yes. [covers his face in shame]
Chris
[approaches] Satan, I understand.
Satan
[drops his left arm and looks surprised] What?
Chris
I still feel secure and safe with you.
Satan
[walks away exasperated] Oh, n-no!
Chris
[puzzled] What? What's wrong? I said it's okay.
Satan
I know.
Chris
Well, what more do you want from me?
Satan
[turns around] Well... could you not be such a pussy about it? I mean, can't you just say "If you ever see Saddam again, I'll break your legs!" or, or "I'm gonna go kick Saddam's ass!" or something?
Chris
Satan, I'm a '90s man. I cry when I need to. I share my feelings and I keep my mind open about everything.
Satan
Just... give me some boundaries, be jealous, go throw a football around, for Christ's sake.
Chris
[sits down on the sofa] Now you're starting to hurt my feelings.
Satan
[turns away] Ah—I'm sorry, Chris, it's... it's not you, really, it's, it's me. [Saddam pops up outside the window and checks out the situation, then drops down] You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and for some reason, I just can't accept that. [Saddam slides the window open and drops in behind the sofa, making his way to Chris]
Saddam
[pops up behind Chris with a dagger] Die, pussy! [rams it into Chris's forehead]
Chris
Agghhh!
Satan
[turns around] Chris! [advances] Saddam, what the hell are you doing?!
Saddam
[a dead Chris lies slumped against the sofa's arm] There. I got rid of the problem for you. Now there's no conflict.
Satan
[distraught, buries his face in his hands] No! Not like this..!
South Park, day. Cartman's church is finished. Red carpet, purple doors... His new followers are gathered inside
Cartman
[on stage wielding a Bible] Friends, I have to tell you that last night I received a phone call from beyond the grave-eh. [the kids gasp] It was our departed friend, Kenny! Calling from the depths of hell! And he described what hell is like in horrid detail-uh. [the kids are frightened] He said that in hell, the smell is awful. He said that in hell, everyone speaks Spanish.
Kids
Wagghh..!
Cartman
He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
Kids
Whoa!
Cartman
And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
Kids
Wagghh! [a couple enters the church]
Father
Where is our daughter?
Heidi
[steps into the aisle] Dad?
Father
Marcy! You're coming home this instant!
Cartman
[quite animated, hops twice] We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! [points]
Father
You're not gonna make my daughter part of your cult!
Cartman
Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
Father
[a piece of wood falls from the roof] You're just a stupid little fat kid who thinks that-- [jab] Aagghh--! [the piece of wood falls off the man's head and rests behind him]
Mother
Stephen? [the kids are shocked; she genuflects next to him] Stephen, no!
Cartman
The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
Kids
Forgive us, Lord.
Cartman
Let us pray. [an organ is played] Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
Mother
[in a panic] Stephen? Stephen?
Hell, waiting area. Many souls are there, wondering where they are, and why
Stephen
Where... where am I?
Man
Where are we?
Man 2
No doubt about it...
Woman
What's happening??
Man 3
Oooooooooh!
Speaker
Hello, newcomers, and welcome. Can everybody hear me? [taps the mic a few times] Hello? Can everyb--? Okay. [the crowd quiets down] Uh, I'm the hell director. Uh, it looks like we have about 8,615 of you newbies today, and for those of you who are a little confused, uh, you are dead, and this is hell, so, abandon all hope and uh yada yada yada. Uh, we are now going to start the orientation process, which will last about--
Man 4
Hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here. I was a totally strict and devout Protestant! I thought we went to heaven!
Hell Director
Yes, well I'm afraid you were wrong.
Soldier
I was a practicing Jehovah's Witness.
Hell Director
Uh, you picked the wrong religion as well.
Man 5
Well, who was right? Who gets into heaven?
Hell Director
I'm afraid it was the Mormons. Yes, the Mormons were the correct answer.
Crowd
[disappointed] Awww.
Hell Director
So now I'd like to quickly introduce your new ruler and master for eternity, Satan.
Satan
[appears in a burst of flame] Oooyeah!
Crowd
Aaggghh!
Satan
Now you are all part of my domain! Everyday in hell grows larger as my minions... my m-minions uh... [relents] muh, I'm sorry. I just can't do this today. I'm just... I'm sorry. [walks away. The crowd's eyes follow him. A woman throws her hands up]
Hell Director
Uh, okay. Thank you, Satan. Now, uh, let's begin with the Muslims...
Chris
[in the crowd] Satan! [Satan turns and sees him, then smiles. Chris makes his way through the crowd] 'Scuse me. Excuse me.
Satan
Chris! [he and Chris now stand before each other] But I thought you were dead!
Chris
Yeah, well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
Satan
Chris, I didn't mean for Saddam to stab you in--
Chris
Hey, it's alright. All that matters is that I'm back, and we're together forever. Right?
Satan
Uh... yeah. Gr-great.
Crowd
Awww.
Cartman residence, night. Cartman is working at a coffee table in the living room with Clyde Frog and a Bible
Cartman
Let's see... Matthew 15:11. "Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man." That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. [Sister Anne approaches]
Liane
[enters] Eric, Sister Anne has come to visit you.
Cartman
Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. [Liane leaves]
Sister Anne
[sits] Eric, you need to stop what you're doing. You need to tell all the kids to go back to school, and back to their normal lives.
Cartman
Sister, have you read this book?
Sister Anne
Yes, Eric. A lot more than you have.
Cartman
Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
Sister Anne
Eric, the Lord just doesn't send everybody to hell. That wouldn't make sense. He wants people to live their lives.
Cartman
Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
Sister Anne
No.
Cartman
We've got Jews and perverts and bullies and all kinds of sinners in this town, Sister Anne-uh! And without the priest we've decided to save ourselves. The only ones that kids can trust now are me and Jesus! [resumes his work]
Sister Anne
[exasperated, drops her head in her hands] Uugh..! [lifts her head] Wait a minute. That's it. [rises and walks away]
Televangelist
[suddenly on TV] ...And I'm gonna save all of you right now. [raps a woman on the head. She goes unconscious] I'm gonna heal your sins-eh.
Cartman
Well...
Hell, Bargain Hotel. Chris approaches and goes to Room 16, and knocks on the door
Saddam
Hello Satan-ooh, crap! It's you!
Chris
Yeah. It's me.
Saddam
I thought I killed you!
Chris
Yeah...
Saddam/Chris
Well, where was I gonna go? Detroit?
Saddam
Right, right.
Chris
Do you have a couple of minutes to go for a walk?
Saddam
A walk?
Chris
Yeah. Just real quick. Around the park or somethin'.
Saddam
[considers it] Is this some kind of trick?
Chris
No, I just want you to go for a quick walk with me. Please?
Saddam
Well, alright. Just let me grab somethin' real quick. [goes inside humming and reaches his dresser. He sees the dagger and takes it with him behind his back, then rejoins Chris] Okay, let's walk. [Chris walks while Saddam closes the door]
Hell, the park. Saddam and Chris walk side by side
Chris
Saddam, I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.
Saddam
Gee, whatever gave you that idea? When I stabbed you in the head?
Chris
Look, Satan is a very important person to me. And I know he's an important person to you, too. So don't you think it's best for us to just... try and get along? I realize that some things about me bother you. So I'd like to hear what those things are so that I can work on them.
Saddam
You know why I don't like you, Chris? Because you're the kind of guy who, if someone didn't like him, would take him for a walk in the park and ask him why. You're a pussy! [takes his dagger out and slices into Chris's right shoulder]
Chris
Agghhh! [Saddam goes into a grave, takes out a shovel, and slices off Chris's lower right leg. Chris falls down] Oh God!
Saddam
Ah hahaha!
Chris
Nooo! Agh! [reaches into his right shoulder, takes the dagger, and thrusts it into Saddam's left eye]
Saddam
Aggghhh! [swings the shovel at Chris and strikes him down with it]
Chris
Ow! [Saddam jumps on him and pulls his heart out of his body] Goo-aagh..! [Saddam holds the heart high in the air, then collapses on top of Chris's body. The camera zooms out]
Cartman's church, next day. The child congregation is gathered again at the church. Organ music plays
Cartman
Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
Kyle
Yes!
Cartman
Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
Kyle
Yes!
Cartman
That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh! [smacks him on the face] Theah!
Kyle
[angrily] Ow! [rubs his right temple and cheek while Cartman talks]
Cartman
Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
Kyle
[softens] Uh, I think so.
Cartman
Praise the Lord-uh!
Crowd
[ad lib all at once] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise God! [two robed assistants help a happy Kyle off the stage]
Cartman
For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person! [Timmy rolls up in his wheelchair] This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
Butters
Huh-Hallelujah!
Timmy
Timmiiiy!
Cartman
We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
Timmy
Timmiiiy!
Cartman
Devil be [smacks him on the face] gone-uh!
Timmy
Haagggh.
Cartman
Now walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]
Timmy
Haagggh.
Cartman
[turns away, then back] Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
Timmy
Haghh.
Cartman
The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! [turns away dramatically, with eyes closed]
Timmy
Timmilih? [drops to the floor on his feet and stands unsteadily. Cartman smiles openly]
Cartman
He walks-uh!
Kids
Whoa!
Timmy
Oh-aagghhh! [falls forward and crashes through the floor head first. A beaming Cartman mistakes this for something good]
Cartman
Yes! Praise the Lord!
Kids
Praise the Lord!
Hell, River Styx Condos. Satan is talking to somebody outside
Satan
And now it's like there's one guy who's horrible to me but I'm totally sexually attracted to, and then one guy who's really nice to me but I'm not sexually attracted to at all.
JonBenét Ramsey
Wow, that really sucks.
Satan
I've asked everybody for advice, but nobody seems to know the answer.
JonBenét Ramsey
Well, there is one person who I always used to ask when I needed advice.
Satan
Who?
JonBenét Ramsey
God.
Satan
[stunned] God?? I can't do that. I haven't spoken to God in like, 5000 years.
JonBenét Ramsey
Well then, maybe it's time.
Cartman's church, day. The child congregation is singing and clapping outside and inside. Timmy is back, with a bandaged head
Kids
Do dodo dum do dodo
Do dodo dum do dodo
Cartman
For he is Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Where are you from, little boy? [this boy wears glasses]
Boy
Denver.
Cartman
And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
Boy
Yeah, that's right.
Kids
Wooooo!
Cartman
Well, God is gonna heal those eyes, and save you from the devil begone! [smacks the boy in the face and knocks him out]
Boy
Aghh... [two robed assistants carry him off]
Kids
Hooray!
Cartman
For he is Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Right here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
Ugly Girl
Yes!
Cartman
He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at! [smacks her on the face] Bah!
Ugly Girl
Wagh...
Cartman
[moonwalks] Bwolololololololololololo! Oh, good Lord, somebody say "Amen!"
Kids
Amen! [the pianist is shown, with a girl singing next to him]
All
Lord, Lord, Lord
A flash of white, and the light dims enough to show clouds roiling in the sky. Satan comes up quickly, and then stops. This is heaven. A group of Mormon souls gather around him
Mormon 1
Hi hi, welcome to heaven, brother. You've followed the Mormon faith, and so you've been let in!
Satan
Uh, actually, I'm just stopping by.
Mormon 2
Well, you've picked a great time! We've got cookies and punch and we're just about to start playing charades.
Mormons
[ad lib all at once] Alright. Yeah.
Mormon 1
And then, Brother Stephen's brought his guitar so we can sing songs about how much it hurts to lie.
Mormons
Ooooh!
Mormon 3
Yeahahah!
Satan
Ah, look, I just need to talk with God. Is he around?
Mormon 2
Sure. All you have to do is say his name and he's there.
Mormon 1
I'm so grateful for that.
Mormons
[in assent] Me, too. Uh huh.
Satan
Great. Thanks. [walks off]
Heaven, a separate area. Satan walks into it and turns to the camera
Satan
[clears his throat] Ah... Hello? G-God? It's uh... Satan. [quickly shields his eyes as a sphere of light descends towards him]
God
[in silhouette] Yea. Look upon me, and know me.
Satan
Hi, God.
God
Hello, Satan. [has a body made from bits of some of the creatures he created] It's... been a long time.
Satan
Yeah.
God
What brings you here? Do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven?
Satan
No, I have a problem, and I... need your advice.
God
You want to rule more than hell? You want to destroy the Earth?
Satan
No, it's kind of a long story but, well, it all started when this Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, [God scratches behind his left ear] was killed by a pack of wild boars. I remember when I first met him in hell. It was a lovely morning in April...
Cartman's church, day. Cartman leads the kids in singing and rolls on his back a few times.
Cartman
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar! [The clapping stops as confused faces appear in the congregation, and the music quiets a bit. Stan and Kyle look at each other as Cartman goes for the collection box] So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah, [sets the box at center stage] and putting a dollar in the box-ah! [kids begin to approach the stage] Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! [rolls on his back as the donations come in]
Stan
Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
Kyle
Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
Heaven, a separate area. Satan finishes his story
Satan
...And now Chris and Saddam just keep killing each other over and over and... I don't know which one to pick.
God
[considers the story, then] Jesus, what the hell happened to you?
Satan
Huh?
God
You got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel. And now you're a whiny little bitch.
Satan
Well, I just don't know which one to pick.
God
No, you've become dependent on relationships. So you haven't even considered the option of not being with either of them. [Satan listens] And if you're not sexually attracted to someone, you're not ever going to be. But Saddam isn't right either. He's the other extreme. You need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance, the middle ground. That's what I always do, because I'm a Buddhist.
Satan
God, you're right. You know, I've had steady relationships for the last... thousand years, and when one ends I just start another one, but... I haven't taken the time to be secure with myself.
God
Bingo. [a fly gets near him and he snaps his tongue out to catch it and eat it]
Satan
Hey... Thanks, God. I forgot how clear you make things sometimes.
God
It was nice to see you again, Satan.
Satan
You too.
God
Goodbye. [turns into the sphere of light and flies up and away. Satan turns and walks off, but encounters the Mormons]
Mormon 2
Would you like to stay for some cookies and punch?
Mormon 1
Yes, would you?
Satan
Uh, no, I need to be getting back.
Mormon 2
Oh, alright then, but you're gonna miss our big play.
Mormon 4
Yes. We're going to do a play about how alcohol can ruin family life.
Satan
Wow. That sounds great, but uh, I really gotta go. [disappears in a burst of flames]
Mormon 1
Well, he seemed like a nice fellow.
Mormon 4
Yes. [a few seconds of silence follow]
Mormon 2
Let's go make things out of egg cartons.
Mormons
[ad lib] Oooh, yeah. I'll do that.
Cartman's church, day. The singing and clapping have resumed. Stan and Kyle go through some curtains to the back of the church.
Cartman
[offscreen] Yeess. [the camera looks at him, now rolling around shirtless in $1 bills, now grabbing a bunch and bathing in them] Yeess. [sees Stan and Kyle] It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
Stan
What worked?
Cartman
Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
Stan/Kyle
What?
Kyle
You're keeping that money yourself?
Cartman
Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars! [grins big] Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
Stan
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
Cartman
It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
Stan
[he and Kyle are now angry] Well, what about going to hell and all that?!
Cartman
Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
Kyle
[points] Then why didn't you tell us?!
Cartman
My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
Kyle
The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
Cartman
[rolls around in the money] Suck my balls!
Stan
Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.
Somewhere in hell. Chris and Saddam are fighting once again. Saddam charges at him with a gray brick
Saddam
Die, pussy! [smashes the brick on Chris's head, and they both fall]
Chris
Ow..! [gets up, grabs one of Saddam's legs, and pulls it off]
Saddam
Aagghh! [gets up, grabs his leg back and beats Chris over the back with it. Chris falls on his face]
Chris
Aagghh! [grabs one end of the leg, and now it's a tug of war. Satan arrives and sees the battle]
Satan
Guys, guys, guys! [the two rivals stop and face him] Look, you both can stop fighting now! I've made a decision.
Chris
You have?
Satan
Yes. I... don't want to be with either one of you.
Chris/Saddam
What?!
Satan
Saddam, you're an asshole. And you'll never be the friend that I want. And Chris, well, you're a pussy. And you'll never be the lover I want. [Chris looks dejected] So I'm just gonna be alone for a while and learn to like myself. [Saddam sighs]
Chris
Satan. Can we go for a walk in the park?
Satan
No, I'm not going on a walk! You're a pussy, Chris, and you drive me crazy; go away!
Chris
Fine. [walks away]
Saddam
Hell, you can't leave me, Satan! I won't let you! [Satan is shocked]
Cartman's church, next day. Cartman holds forth. Stan and Kyle stand behind the collection box as kids stop by and put in their $1 donations
Cartman
Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! [Sister Anne enters the church]
Sister Anne
[walking down center aisle] Alright kids, it's time to go. It's time for this to stop!
Cartman
Sister Anne is a blasphemer!
Sister Anne
I know you won't listen to me. That's why I brought somebody else. [steps aside. The curtains part. Jesus enters and walks down the aisle]
Kids
[in obvious awe] Wow!
Butters
Jesus!
Cartman
[worried] Uh-oh.
Jesus
Kids, you need to all stop spending all your time here and go back to school.
Cartman
[tugs on Jesus' robs, then softly] Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.
Jesus
God doesn't want you to spend all your time being afraid of hell, or praising His name. God wants you to spend your time helping others, and living a good, happy life. That's how you live for Him.
Cartman
[goes for the collection box again] Ee-yes, by doing that, [brings it out] and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
Bebe
Let's go ice-skating.
Girls
Yea! [leave their seats]
Butters
Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
Boy
Yeah. [others leave their seats and vacate the church]
Cartman
[on his knees] No, come back! You face everlasting damnation! [the last congregant leaves the church] Wait! No! No! [pounds the floor with his fists a few times] I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
Kyle
Serves you right, Cartman!
Stan
Yeah!
Jesus
But Eric, I think this time I have to teach you a lesson. I'm sending you somewhere to think about your sins!
Cartman
You're gonna send me to hell?
Jesus
No. Worse!
Ensenada, Mexico, day. Mariachi music plays in the background. A tour bus stops in front of Papas and Beer and drops Cartman off, then pulls away
Kenny
[rushes up to him] (Eric! Eric!)
Cartman
[sees Kenny] Aw, crap!
Hell, the park. Satan is strolling through the park in a happy mood
Satan
[encounters two men] Hi, Bob. Hi, Rick.
Rick
Hi, Satan.
Saddam
[waiting in the road] There you are!
Satan
[rolls his eyes] Awgh... Not again.
Saddam
You know you can't live without me. Now get that ass back to bed!
Satan
Saddam, I told you, I don't need you anymore!
Saddam
You can't leave me, Satan. Nobody leaves me.
Satan
Yes, I can! Raaarrr! [blasts a hole through Saddam with lightning from his index finger. Saddam falls]
Saddam
Aw, you little..prick!
Satan
Goodbye forever, Saddam!
Saddam
[coughs] What are you talking about? You can kill me, but I'll be back tomorrow.
Satan
Not this time. I asked a favor of an old friend of mine to let you in.
Saddam
Let me in where? [flames engulf Saddam and disappears]
Heaven, Saddam is whisked into it, as Satan was
Saddam
What the..? Hey, what the hell is this place?!
Mormon 5
Hello, and welcome.
Mormon 1
We're glad you made it, brother.
Saddam
Ey, who the hell are you?
Mormon 6
We're just about to do a play, about how much stealing hurts you deep inside. Come join us. [he and others crowd in on Saddam]
Mormons
[ad lib] Yes. Come on. Let's go.
Mormon 6
You're here forever. [the Mormons lift him up and carry him away over their heads]
Saddam
Nooo! N-nooooooooooo!
End of Probably

Fourth Grade
South Park Elementary, morning. The school bell rings. A "WELCOME BACK!" sign hangs over a row of student lockers as kids mill around in the hall. The camera pans to the right to show the four boys standing before their new classroom: FOURTH GRADE.
Stan
Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
Kyle
Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! [two older boys come up behind Stan and Kyle and punch them to the floor. A third 5th-grader arrives. Stan and Kyle look up.]
5th-Grader in middle
Get out of my way, you little dorks! [Stan and Kyle struggle a bit, then get up]
Kyle
Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!
5th-Grader in middle
Yeah, but now, we're fifth-graders, you stupid fourth-graders, so move it! [he and the boy to his left punch Stan and Kyle down again.]
Kyle
[rises with Stan] Ungh, gay, dude.
Stan
Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up. [looks left and sees someone] Hey, come here [signals a boy over.]
Younger Boy
What?
Stan
What grade are you going into?
Younger Boy
Thi-ird
Stan
Stupid third grader!
Cartman
Yeah, [punches the boy down] get out of here! [withdraws]
Younger Boy
Uhuhuhow.
Cartman
There, that's better.
Kyle
You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
Stan
Denver? [Butters and Clyde arrive]
Cartman
U-hoh, dude, we could walk all over her. [Kevin arrives]
Kyle
He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! [Pip arrives, then Craig, then Wendy and Bebe]
Stan
Alright. [turns to face the gathering group] Hey, listen up everybody! [Tweek and four others arrive, then Timmy...] We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! [the other kids smile]
Clyde
Like what?
Stan
[with a look of determination] Like... ah, how about right at 8:35 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout, "KISS MY ASS!!!" all together!
The Kids
YEAH!!!
Cartman
[softly] Why, that's PERfect!
Butters
Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down, [turns to his left to demonstrate] should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
Stan
...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
Butters
Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this [shows his back to Stan and moves his right hand around], with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
Kyle
...Yeah. Or we could just show our asses.
Stan
Okay, so it's decided. When the clock hits 8:35 we all stand up on our desks, pull down our pants and yell, "KISS MY ASS!!!"
Kyle
Together we are strong! [raises fists]
The Kids
YEAH!!!
Clyde
[points to Timmy] Hey, Timmy might need some help pulling his pants down.
Stan
We got you covered, Timmy.
Timmy
Timmay!
The bell rings again, and the kids enter their new classroom a bit awed at the surroundings. Lab sinks and equipment line the walls. New, modern desks greet them. An aquarium and some modern art are also present.
Kyle
Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?
Butters
Huhuh, look at all this stuff.
Cartman
[takes a seat] Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
Stan
Dude, look at the walls. [A new alphabet strip in Vivaldi font hangs over the chalkboard] Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
New Teacher
[enters, faces the students, and talks with a bit of an accent] Alright, children, quiet down. Welcome to the fourth grade. [the kids stare at her with mouths open. Her breasts hang down to her knees]
Kyle
Holy God, dude!
Kenny
(Those titties are fuckin' huge!) [the teacher turns and write on the board...]
New Teacher
My name is Ms. Choksondik.
Stan
[softly, to Kyle] ...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. [starts chuckling]
Kyle
Yeah! [starts chuckling]
Ms. Choksondik
[now with book in hand] Play time is over, children! Do you understand me?! [a stunned silence fills the room] I don't know how your last teacher behaved, but this is the fourth grade! [Cartman grabs on tight to his chair as he looks at the wall clock, which now reads 8:35] And it is time to go to work!
Cartman
[chuckles, leaps up on his desk, and moons Ms. Choksondik] KISS MY ASS!!! [no one else moves a muscle, as they are still awed by the teacher's appearance. Cartman looks left, then right...] Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
Ms. Choksondik
[arms akimbo] Well, young man, I hope you have a good explanation for this.
Cartman
[with his back still to Ms. Choksondik] Oh, I'm sure I do.
Ms. Choksondik
This is the fourth grade! You need to grow up! [wags a finger at him]
Cartman
I'm trying.
Ms. Choksondik
Now, get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class.
Cartman
[pulls his pants up and sits down again] Fantastic, then.
Ms. Choksondik
[turns to the board and begins writing] Now, let us begin our first-day exam. [the class sighs audibly] SILENCE!
South Park Elementary, outside. The bell rings, and the students head out onto the playground.
Stan
What a bitch!
Kyle
And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
Cartman
You guys are all such pussies!
Tweek
I can't take it, man! Writing in cursive?? Fractions?? I can't do i-it!
Stan
This is it. The end of innocence. [grows sad] This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
Kyle
I just didn't think it would come so soon.
Cartman
Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
Kyle
Huh?
Cartman
Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
[wistfully] Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
[a classroom scene, then a playground scene as heads of Cartman and Kenny float by]
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
[Mr. Garrison is dressed as a pirate before a happy class]
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
[Their desks turn into marshmallow seats and float up as the classroom fades into sky. A teddy-bear face floats by]
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
[They float towards a rainbow and sun, and the scene fades to black, then to the playground]
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
[Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land]
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
[Cartman makes a glitter picture of a cow's face]
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
[Kenny makes one of a clown holding a bloody knife in one hand and a boy's bloody head in the other]
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
[Cartman sings to the audience and points]
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
[Garrison leads the class in a march at a candy land, then gives each kid a happy spanking in a room full of huge wrapped presents. The scene fades to the playground again]
To Third Grade
[A moment of silence, and Clyde starts to cry. Butters draws near and consoles him]

Kyle
Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
Butters
Huh-it sure was.
Cartman
[wistfully] I wish I was still there.
Stan
Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
Kyle
How?
Stan
[a bit dramatic] We travel back in time.
Kyle
Oh yeah, time travel.
Butters
Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt? [waves the suggestion off] I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
Stan
It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
Cartman
Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
Kyle
Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
Cartman
Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
The basement of the two college guys, after school. These are computer geeks, with at least three computers in there. The blond guy works on his nose as he talks.
Nerd #1
When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-
Cartman
Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
Nerd #2
Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn't make it back.
Stan
We don't want to make it back, we want to stay there.
Nerd #1
Oh.
Kyle
So can you do it?
Nerd #2
It's all theoretical, but from a scientific standpoint, the creation of a rip in space-time is possible. We just need to find an inertia device. [they think]
Nerd #1
Heeeyyy. [approaches Timmy's chair] This kid's electric wheelchair might be just what we need.
Timmy
Tuh-timmih?
South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey are talking to Chef.
Principal Victoria
Oh, this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts!
Chef
What's the problem?
Mr. Mackey
Uh, you see, Chef, Ms. Choksondik has very large, uh, honkers, and she doesn't seem to like wearing a bra.
Chef
You call that a problem? That sounds like heaven to me.
Mr. Mackey
No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay. [the door opens and a very angry Ms. Choksondik enters]
Ms. Choksondik
Principal Victoria, I would like a word! [her elongated breasts swing freely under her blouse.]
Chef
Oooo! Call the doctor!
Ms. Choksondik
My new students are the most misbehaved, illiterate, brain-dead group of children I have ever come across!
Principal Victoria
Well, Miss... Choksondik, those children did fairly well in the third grade.
Ms. Choksondik
One of them is mentally handicapped, for Christ's sake!
Principal Victoria
Oh? Which one?
Ms. Choksondik
The one in the wheelchair! Look, I would like to have a talk with their last year's teacher! Who was it? Mr. Uh-heh, Garrison?! [Terror strikes the faces of Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria as they look at each other]
Principal Victoria
I'm afraid that's impossible. Nobody's seen Mr. Garrison since the last school year ended.
Ms. Choksondik
Why?! Where did he go?!
Mr. Mackey
[softly, slowly] We... don't like to talk about it.
Ms. Choksondik
But I need help reaching these kids! I have nothing but the highest expectations for them. And with [raises her left arm, which causes the breast nipples to reveal themselves] God as my witness-
The Adults
Aww Oooo!
Ms. Choksondik
I'm going to teach these kids the wonders of the world, so that they can reach the top! [the others recoil at the sight of her nipples again] I hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this Mr. Garrison! And with that I will bid you good day!
Principal Victoria
[trying to hide her stare] Wuh sure thing, fine, bye-bye then. [Ms. Choksondik exits and the other three breathe sighs of relief. Chef instinctively vomits, then covers his mouth.]
South Park Elementary, Ms. Choksondik's classroom, next day. The kids are all in their seats wearing goggles and the two nerds are with them
Nerd #1
Alright, when we power up, the handicapped kid's chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way [towards the board], then make the required magnetic vibrations.
Nerd #2
If the fields are right, it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom.
Wendy
You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?
Nerd #1
Now, eh, when you all see a wormhole, yuh-you guys are gonna have about 4.2 seconds to run through it.
Nerd #2
And on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot, only one year ago.
Stan
Back in the third grade.
Kids
Cool/Wow.
Kyle
I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
Kids
Yeah!
Stan
Oh! Here she comes.
Ms. Choksondik
[enters] Alright, children, I hope you all did your homework last night. Please pass your papers up to the frontuh.
Cartman
[hops up on his seat] Suck my balls!!! [no one else moves] Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
Ms. Choksondik
[sternly] I said, pass your papers to the fronteh!
Cartman
We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
Ms. Choksondik
It's Choksondik! And you are all going to have detention!
Cartman
Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? [a handheld controller with two thumb joysticks is activated. The two nerds get to work]
Nerd #1
Primary fusion initiated.
Nerd #2
Molecular grenadine active. [Timmy's chair starts to convulse]
Timmy
Aa-aa-ah!
Ms. Choksondik
What are you doing?!
Cartman
We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! [the wheelchair is launched and Timmy moves towards the chalkboard]
Timmy
Timmaaaaaaaaah! [Ms. Choksondik steps aside as Timmy breaks through the wall and out into the snow] Timmaaaaaaaaah! [his voice trails off. The class is in shock. Ms. Choksondik turns and looks out the gaping hole as Timmy turns right and goes past a tree]
Nerd #1
I didn't think it would work.
Nerd #2
Me neither.
Ms. Choksondik
Well, well, well! I'd say somebody has some explaining to do!
Cartman
You're damn right they do!
Kyle
Dude! Timmy's chair is packed with all that stuff! We've gotta help him!
Stan
Yeah!
Kyle
Come on! [the other kids scramble out of their chairs and rush outside]
Ms. Choksondik
Children! Children, come back here!
South Park, the streets. Timmy is rolling down the street being passed by honking cars going this way and that. Timmy screams a frightened scream
Stan
Timmy, you have to stop!
Nerd #1
No!
Stan
No??
Nerd #1
Look, the system malfunctions if he stops. The nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high.
Kyle
What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
Nerd #1
No!
Kyle
[with trembling voice] No??
Nerd #2
We've rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight. If he gets off, the whole thing blows!
Stan
So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
The Nerds
Yup.
Stan
My God!
NEWS 4 LIVE UPDATE
Anchor Tom
[Timmy is shown moving down the street screaming] It's been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boy's wheelchair set with explosives.
South Park, Tele's. The boys and the nerds rush to the video window to watch the report
Stan
Over here, over here!
Anchor Tom
The child can't stop or get off the chair without risking explosion, and so the SWAT team will now attempt to disarm the device.
South Park, a street. Timmy reaches an open stretch of road
Timmy
[in distress] Timmi-hih-ih! [above him a helicopter appears, and a SWAT team member is lowered while keeping up with Timmy]
SWAT Hansen
Closer! [reaches Timmy] Don't worry, son. Just watch your speed and stay still! [both approach a pair of women waiting to hitch a ride going the other direction]
Pilot
Look out, Hansen!
SWAT rescuer Hansen
Oh! [flies into the blonde, knocking her away. Timmy ends up with the brunette on his chair]
Brunette
Aaaah!
Timmy
Timmaaay!
Hansen
[floats up to them again] Dear Jesus! Hang on, lady!
Brunette
Oh my God, what's going on?
Hansen
Ma'am, be very careful! That wheelchair is set to explode!
Brunette
What?! [scrambles around Timmy] AAAH!! Omigod! Omigod!
Hansen
It's okay! Just stay calm and keep the speed above 5!
Brunette
[trying to hang on] O-kay. O-kay. Omigod.
Timmy
Tih-Timmah? [the woman sets the speed and locks it in a flash]
Brunette
Okay. I kept the speed at 5.
Hansen
Good! What's the wheelchair's battery power at?
Brunette
Oh my God! Less than 20 minutes!
South Park, Tele's. The boys react to the news
Stan
Less than 20 minutes?!
Kyle
Oh no! What have we done?!
South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Principal Victoria holds up an oversize bra for Chef's and Mr. Mackey's appraisal
Principal Victoria
Whattaya think? Too forward? [the door opens and in enters...]
Ms. Choksondik
I HAVE HAD IT!!!
Principal Victoria
Waaah! [tosses the bra behind her seat]
Ms. Choksondik
These children are out of control! I must speak with their last year's teacher, Mr. Garrison! [again, the three other adults show fear...]
Principal Victoria
As we said before, that's impossible.
Ms. Choksondik
What in God's name happened to him?
Chef
Uuuh, Ms. Choksondik, Mr. Garrison had several uuh, eee-motional issues. He was a closet homosexual who hated gay people. Whenever someone asked him if he was gay, he'd go nuts.
Principal Victoria
And then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy.
Mr. Mackey
After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn.
Principal Victoria
He finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and... went up into the mountains to live in solitude.
Chef
Some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin', "I'm not gaaay! I'm not gaaay!"
Mr. Garrison
[barely audible in the distance. The adults strain to hear] Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!
Ms. Choksondik
And, nobody has found him?
Mr. Mackey
Well, we really haven't ll-looked.
Ms. Choksondik
I see. [a kitten walks up to her] Then the only way I'll find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find Mr. Garrison myself!
Principal Victoria
But he could be anywhere up high in those mountains.
Ms. Choksondik
Oh, I'll find him! Even if I have to climb up [arms spread out and raised to chest level] and up [raised to ear level] and up!
Chef, Victoria, Mackey
NOOO!!
Ms. Choksondik
[lowers upraised arms] What?
South Park, a street. Timmy and the brunette are still on the open stretch of road
Brunette
Oh my God, Oh my God!
South Park, a street. A field reporter is on the scene
Field Reporter
Tom, I'm standing about two miles outside of Denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death. [camera pulls back to show the nerds next to the reporter, and the boys across the street] Guys, can you tell us what kind of explosive we're actually dealing with here.
Nerd #1
Uh, well, it's a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-
Timmy
[while the blond nerd talks] Ah, please help!
Nerd #2
Which just turned into a time bomb.
Timmy
Please help.
Nerd #1
This has never happened in all the 72 original Star Trek episodes.
Nerd #2
Yah... wait, you mean 73 episodes.
Nerd #1
...No, there were 72.
Nerd #2
No there weren't!
Nerd #1
[pushes his friend away] Oh, you are such a nerd! [they start slapping each other around]
Field Reporter
[camera zooms in] Tom, I understand that now, the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boy's little friends, in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully, disarm the device.
South Park, a street. A SWAT truck full of rescuers passes Timmy and the brunette and slows down to wheelchair speed. Kenny is with them
Hansen
It's alright, everything's goin' tuh be fine.
Brunette
Oh my God!
Hansen
[sets Kenny on a dolly and secures him] Alright, young man, when you get underneath that wheelchair, I want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie, and then I'll tell you which wires to cross. Ready?
Kenny
(Yes, sir!)
Hansen
Go below! [releases the winch. Kenny and the dolly make their way to Timmy, but they pass each other. Kenny keeps rolling down the road past Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]
Kenny
(Hi guys.) [keeps rolling until he trips over a manhole cover.] (Uh oh.) [the dolly lands on him] (Uff. I'm okay.) [the winch is suddenly yanked, and Kenny zips away] (I'm oKAAAYYYYYYY!!!) [the camera switches to Stan, Kyle, and Cartman looking in the direction of a terribly screechy sound. Soon, Kenny appears ripping up the road with his face, and he stops in front of them, dead]
Stan
Well, who didn't see that coming?
Brunette
[camera back on the wheelchair] Oh my God! Oh my God!
Hansen
Stay calm! You have to stay calm! [Timmy looks up at him]
Brunette
[in a panic] But if we got off the chair it blows up!
Hansen
No no, that's only if the boy gets off.
Brunette
Oh. [hops off and stands up] See ya!
Timmy
Timmih! [Hansen starts to work on the chair]
Pilot
Ten seconds, Hansen!
Stan
...nine, eight...
Timmy
[looks down at Hansen] Please-a help me.
Pilot
...six, five...
Timmy
Please help me. Please help me.
Hansen
Got it! I think! Up, up! [the helicopter rises and takes him up with it]
Timmy
[upset] Timmay! [with a burst of speed the wheelchair accelerates, then disappears in a flare. Nothing remains of him. The rescuer is back in the helicopter looking down at the event with other rescuers, and the boys are on the curb shocked. The nerds are stunned, and the TV shows the site of the disappearance without comment]
Nerd #1
Hey, it did work. [the other nerd grins]
South Park, a tall mountain not unlike the Matterhorn, next day. Ms. Choksondik scales it, and reaches a plateau. Several cats follow her up. She sees a cave and approaches it, then enters
Ms. Choksondik
Hello-oo-ooo. [walks further in with a lit flashlight] Oh, what am I doing? I'm gonna get myself killed. [calls out] Is anyone here? [the beam falls on Mr. Garrison, now hunched over against a wall and with a full beard. Mr. Hat has a matching beard. Garrison hisses at her] Mister? Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
Ms. Choksondik
I am the new fourth grade teacher. I've come to... seek your help. [Garrison hisses at her again] Please. I don't know how to handle the new fourth graders. I've tried everything. I need to know how you taught them.
Mr. Garrison
[hiding from the light] No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months. [the cats try to get at Ms. Choksondik's]
Ms. Choksondik
Mr. Garrison, you knew how to reach these kids! You're my only hope!
Mr. Garrison
Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?
Ms. Choksondik
Choksondik.
Mr. Garrison
No I don't! [rushes up to her] IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!
Ms. Choksondik
Mr. Garrison, these children are depending on me to give them a future. I can't do it without your guidance. Please! Help me, for them! For the future of our children!
Mr. Garrison
...Two hundred bucks.
Ms. Choksondik
...Done.
The basement of the two college guys, after school. The boys show up again. Much of the stuff that was in the basement is gone. Soon, it is shown that the second nerd has moved out
Stan
Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
Nerd #1
Huh? Oh... Can't.
Kyle
What do you mean, "can't"?! You made it work; just build us another one!
Nerd #1
I can't, because pizza-face isn't here! We're not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!
Stan
W-what did you get in a fight about?
Nerd #1
There's 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there's 72!
Stan
Oh, Jesus Christ! You've got to be kidding me!
Nerd #1
No! He actually thinks there's 72.!
Cartman
Look, dude, can't you just build us another machine without him?
Nerd #1
No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom's. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he's wrong...
Stan
Alright, come on, guys. [the boys exit the basement and head up the stairs] Man, I can't believe we have to do this while Timmy's already back in time!
Kyle
Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
A tropical forest. Dinosaurs roam this land. A pteranodon flies overhead as a triceratops chases Timmy
Timmy
Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!
South Park, the "Matterhorn," the plateau outside Garrison's cave. Mr. Garrison walks around Ms. Choksondik as she balances three books on each hand and one on her head while standing on only her left foot.
Mr. Garrison
Alright, let's try it again.
Ms. Choksondik
"Children, we are now going to do math problems."
Mr. Garrison
"But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems."
Ms. Choksondik
"Uuh! Ah, you will do them or else you'll be in very big trouble!"
Mr. Garrison
"Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"
Ms. Choksondik
"Don't use that kind of language, young man!"
Mr. Garrison
NOOO![Ms. Choksondik drops the books in terror]
Ms. Choksondik
[drops the books in terror] No??
Mr. Garrison
Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, "Suck my balls," you say, "Present them."
Ms. Choksondik
Oh.
Mr. Garrison
Now, let's try it again. [gathers the books up and repositions them on Ms. Choksondik's hands and head, then stands to her left. She resumes balancing on her left foot and concentrates.] SUCK MY BALLS!
Ms. Choksondik
Pre-sent them?
Mr. Garrison
[softens] Good. [Ms. Choksondik relaxes a bit and opens her eyes] Very good. [with authority] You're ready to move on to the next level. But I warn you: we will now be diving deep into your own psyche. These children know what scares you, and so we, too, must face those demons.
Ms. Choksondik
I'm ready. I'm not afraid.
Mr. Garrison
[ominously, gruffly] You will be! You will be! [coughs] You will be.
South Park, a house. Eight boys approach it: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Butters, Kevin, Token, Tweek, and Clyde. Stan knocks
Stan
God-damnit, this is ridiculous.
Nerd #2
[opens the door angrily] What?!
Stan
Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
Nerd #2
Look! There aren't 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! "The Menagerie" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!
Cartman
Who the hell cares?!
Nerd #2
I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!
Kyle
Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
Nerd #2
No, because he's WRONG!
Kyle
Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
Nerd #2
And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don't think so! I don't want to live in that world. [slams the door shut]
Cartman
God, these guys are such geek dumbasses!
Stan
I know.
Butters
Yeh-hah. They don't even realize that "The Menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha. Ha ha. [pauses to see if anyone responds] Hahahaha, eh the, eh the dumbasses.
Stan
Wait a minute! I've got it. [knocks again]
Nerd #2
[opens the door angrily] What?!
Stan
Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
Nerd #2
[thinks for a moment] Dude, Jesus, you're right.
South Park, the "Matterhorn." Mr. Garrison takes Ms. Choksondik to a gnarled, giant willow tree on a mountainside forest
Mr. Garrison
This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
Ms. Choksondik
What lives inside?
Mr. Garrison
Hell if I know. I wouldn't go in there.
Ms. Choksondik
Oh, alrighty. [enters the base of the tree and through the hewn hallway, then sees a light at the other end.] What the? Why there's nothing in here but an exit to the other side! [peers through it, then pulls back] There's nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here. [thinks for a moment] Wait a minute. Maybe there's not supposed to be anything in here. Maybe I'm supposed to see that I alone do have the strength to reach the kids! [clenches her fists] I think I get it now! [walks out the other end]
Mr. Garrison
[bides his time and sighs] Hey, hurry up in there! [under his breath] Jesus. [knocks on the tree entrance] You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight! [looks at the entrance, then looks in] You in there?! [enters the hallway himself] Hey, where the hell did she go? [a few more steps, and rumbling begins] What the? [the entrance closes and a mirror Garrison, clean-shaven, appears. The unkempt Garrison shivers] Haaa! Who? Who are you?
Clean Garrison
[surely] I am you. [approaches the unkempt Garrison] I am your gay side.
Unkempt Garrison
My gay side, uh- I DON'T HAVE A GAY SIDE!!!
Clean Garrison
You must face me at last. [the two of them just stare at each other]
South Park, the "Matterhorn," moments later...
Unkempt Garrison
You aren't real! You can't be!
Clean Garrison
It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate.
Unkempt Garrison
What do you want?
Clean Garrison
I want you to not fight me anymore. To accept me, once and for all.
Unkempt Garrison
Why?
Clean Garrison
Don't you see? [approached the unkempt one] All these years, your pain, your confusion, it comes from one place. Your denial of who you are. [his voice softens] Of who... we are.
Unkempt Garrison
But I'm not gay! Everyone just thinks I am!
Clean Garrison
Oh, stop it! What about the time you looked at Counselor Mackey's penis in the men's locker room?!
Unkempt Garrison
I was just comparing size!
Clean Garrison
For seven minutes?!
Unkempt Garrison
Aaa! [turns away in despair]
Clean Garrison
And what about the time you masturbated to the men's 100-meter swimming relay at the Olympics?!
Unkempt Garrison
I was beating off to the chicks!
Clean Garrison
THERE WERE NO CHICKS!
Unkempt Garrison
OH, DAMN YOU SPIRIT! HAUNT ME NO LONGER!
Clean Garrison
ADMIT IT!
Unkempt Garrison
NO!!!
Clean Garrison
YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING TO YOURSELF AND GET A G-
Unkempt Garrison
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, I ADMIT IT! I'M GAY!!! [camera zooms in as Garrison comes to terms with this admission] I'm...gay. I'm gay! [rises] I am gay! You hear that everyone? [goes towards the exit] I'm gay! I'm gay! I'm gay and it... [gets emotional] and it feels good.
South Park Elementary, Ms. Choksondik's classroom, a few days later. Where the chalkboard used to be are just some boards hastily put up, along with a DO NOT CROSS line and three safety cones to guard this makeshift board.
Ms. Choksondik
Alright, children, I hope you all did your- [the class once again has goggles on and the two nerds are back together in the back of the class ready to activate another machine --- a microwave oven with a duck tied to it.] Oowhat is going on now?! [three kittens run up and frolic near her breasts]
Cartman
Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
Ms. Choksondik
[cups her ears] Oh Good Gravy, not this again.
Cartman
Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck [the contraption is shown and the duck quacks.] Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? [the nerds activate their controllers]
Ms. Choksondik
Children, I will have order!!
Nerd #1
I can't wait for Gene Roddenberry to tell you how WRONG you are! Just like when you said there were no two-parters of Battlestar Galactica!
Nerd #2
There WEREN'T!
Nerd #1
The episode called "Gonzo on Ice Planet Zero" was a two-parter.
Nerd #2
No it WASN'T!
Stan
Oh, son of a bitch!
Nerd #1
I'll kill you! [the nerds start slapping each other again. Nerd #2 throws his controller at Nerd #1, and the controller hits the floor. The microwave is activated and soon blows up along with the bird, leaving behind a portal]
Cartman
There it is! Come on, everybody! [the kids move towards the portal]
Ms. Choksondik
Children, get back into your seats!
Cartman
No way, lady!
Ms. Choksondik
Eric, I mean it!
Cartman
You can suck my balls!
Ms. Choksondik
[strikes a meditative pose as the camera does some vertigo, then] Present them. [everyone stops what they're doing and looks at her. Nerd #2 was about to strike Nerd #1 with a desk.]
Cartman
...What?
Ms. Choksondik
You said, "suck my balls." Well, go ahead. Whip 'em out, and I'll suck 'em.
Stan
[softly] Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
Cartman
Touché, teacher. Touché.
Ms. Choksondik
Now, children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life isn't about going back, it's about going forward. Yes, there are times in our life that we wish we could relive, but, if we already lived them perfectly, why live them again? The adventure of life is that there's always something new. New challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?
Stan
Dude. Sh-she's right.
Kyle
Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
Stan
Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
Kyle
Yeah! You suck, Cartman! [the kids return to their seats, leaving Cartman alone]
Cartman
What??
Ms. Choksondik
Alright, students, that will be quite enough! If you're ready, let's continue on... with the fourth grade. [as she turns to write her name on the makeshift board, a noise is heard]
Timmy
AAAAAAA! [reappears covered in items from every time period in history]
Kyle
Hey, Timmy's back!
Stan
Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
Timmy
[shifts a bit here and there] Eh, Timmih.
South Park Elementary, Principal's office. Chef talks with Mr. Mackey and Principal Victoria
Chef
You know I'm always here to help, Principal Victoria. [the door opens]
Mr. Garrison
[skips in happily] Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!! [the other three look]
Principal Victoria
Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Mackey
What?
Mr. Garrison
I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
Principal Victoria
You admit it? You admit it! [the three of them gather around him smiling]
Mr. Mackey
Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!
Mr. Garrison
[fairly bouncing with joy] Yeah, it feels really good!
Principal Victoria
Well, congratulations!
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, congratulations!
Mr. Garrison
You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!
Principal Victoria
Oh. I'm sorry, we don't hire gay people. [silence, then Chef, Mr. Mackey, and Principal Victoria laugh as Mr. Garrison stews]
End of Fourth Grade

Trapper Keeper
Bus Stop. Stan and Kenny wait patiently. Kyle and Ike walk up. Ike is dressed in a little business suit and his hair is combed
Stan
Dude, what's your little brother doing here?
Kyle
Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
Stan
But isn't he only three years old?
Kyle
Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten.
Ike
I pooped my pants.
Kyle
[moves Ike aside and shows his folder] But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper. [opens it up and displays the inside] It has five different compartments for each subject in school, [closes it and shows off the covers] and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
Stan
Cool!
Cartman
[walks up with his own folder] Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000. [slight pause. Kyle reacts] Yeah, well, [opens his up] it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's, [opens it up again] flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar.
Stan
Wow, cool!
Kyle
Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
Cartman
Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase.
Kyle
He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
Cartman
He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
Ike
I pooped my pants!
Kyle
He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
Cartman
Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. [soft music plays and Cartman starts to dance]
Kyle
Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! [music continues, and the bus rolls up]
School bus. The boys take their seats. Cartman and Kenny sit behind Kyle, Stan, and Ike. Stan, Kyle and Kenny notice a disheveled man on the other side of the bus
Stan
Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus.
Ms. Crabtree
Sit down and shut up!!
Stan
But they smell like pee.
Man
[in European accent] I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.
Kyle
You are?
Man
Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.
Stan
Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
Bill
I was held back ten human grades. [grimaces and grunts] I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?
Cartman
Yeah, that's me.
Bill
Eric Cartman? And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?
Cartman
Yeahhh, you already know about it?
Bill
Yes. Yes, I do.
Cartman
Well... [mocking] "Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"
Kyle
I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
Stan
Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
Kyle
No, I don't! I don't care!
Cartman
[stick the notebook out] Here, Kyle. [Bill stares at Cartman's Trapper Keeper]
South Park Elementary, kindergarten room. The room appears festive, the wall adorned with a beaming sun with rays coming from it, rolling hills with trees here and there. The kids enter and take their places at the round table. Two miffed boys stand by the door as Ike enters the room
Boy #1
Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius.
Boy #2
Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten.
Boy #1*
Come on. [The two boys walk up to Ike and sit on the chairs on either side of him] So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5?
Ike
Unkoo baba.
Mr. Garrison
[enters the room] Okay, children, let's take our seats. [closes the door and approaches the table] My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little [wags the index and ring finger of each hand] "nervous breakdown" and went into the mountains where I lived off of "rat carcasses". [a view of some of the kids' reactions] But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten. [a view of other kids' reactions] But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it? [the kids look confused] No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?
Filmore*
Here.
Mr. Garrison
Sally Bands?
Sally
Here.
Mr. Garrison
Ike Broflovski?
Ike
Cookie Monster.
Mr. Garrison
Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too. [Fillmore and his friend glare at Ike] Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. [Ike looks at Filmore and friend and starts to sink in his seat]
South Park Elementary, fourth grade room. The class is present, along with "Bill Cosby" Cartman elaborates on the wonderful attributes of his Trapper Keeper
Cartman
And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically. [Kyle glares at him with arms crossed.] I can take something as simple as this calculator [a Wellington Bear model] and... Trapper Keeper?
Trapper Keeper
[its TV screen turns on] Trapper Keeper active.
Cartman
Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
Trapper Keeper
Ready for hybrid. [Two cables reach out and grab the calculator and pull it into a ready slot. Cartman closes the Trapper Keeper]
Cartman
And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
Kids
Wow.
Bill
[reaches over Cartman's shoulder] May I hold your Trapper Keeper?
Cartman
Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers. [wiggles them outstretched] If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands.
Kyle
Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
Cartman
Oh really? [hands the folder over to Kyle] Then, why don't you hold it? [Kyle looks at it in Cartman's outstretched hand.] Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it. [inches closer and whispers] Hold it.
Kyle
I'm gonna!
Cartman
[inches closer and whispers] Hold it.
Kyle
I will!
South Park Elementary, kindergarten room. Mr. Garrison is telling his life story to the kids
Mr. Garrison
And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better. [some of the kids are stunned. Garrison starts writing on the board] Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president, [writes up "KINDERGARTEN CLASS PRESIDENT" on the chalkboard and underlines it] so first we must pick nominees. [turns and faces the class] Who would like to nominate someone?
Boy #2
I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, Filmore. [writes the name on the board] You'll be our first nominee. And who else? [a girl raises her hand] Yes, Jenny.
Jenny
I gotta go doodie.
Mr. Garrison
In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president? [the kids stay quiet] Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius.
Ike
[looks at an angry Fillmore and friend] No.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius. [writes the name up on the board. Filmore and friend stare at a chagrined Ike] Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?
Filmore
[leaves his seat, approaches the board, and faces the class] If I'm elected class president, I'll call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays, I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank you. [returns to his seat]
Mr. Garrison
Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you?
Ike
[leaves his seat, approaches the board, and faces the class] Cookie Monster. Ice.
Mr. Garrison
...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids.
South Park Elementary, playground. The four boys stand around the tetherball pole while two kids in front of them toss a football, two girls walk by behind them, another kid climbs the jungle gym, and another rocks on a hobby elephant
Stan
Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
Bill
Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend? [winces] I mean, friend?
Cartman
I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
Bill
Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square-- [coughs up] I mean, four square.
Cartman
Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me.
Bil
Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!
Cartman
Okay, that's cool.
Bil
[holds up the tetherball] Can we play some human tetherball?
Cartman
A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- [by this time, "Bill" has pulled away from the pole and Cartman, and has the tether taut and ready to release]
Bil
Serve! [whips the ball at Cartman, knocking him onto his back. The Trapper Keeper falls away and lands next to Kenny. "Bill" makes his move]
Cartman
Ugh..! ["Bill" goes after the Trapper Keeper and runs away with it]
Bil
Got it!
Cartman
Ey!
Stan
Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! [just then, spikes come out of the Trapper Keeper and some of them go clear through "Bill's" hands.]
Bill
[stops and looks at his pierced hands] Waa-agggh! [clenches his teeth and continues running]
Cartman
You son of a bitch! [recalls something] Wait a minute. [whips out a small gadget and activates it] Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. [walks towards the source of the sound heard in the device and away from his friends]
Stan
[confused] What the hell just happened?
Kyle
[angry] Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
South Park Elementary, Kindergarten. Mr. Garrison tallies up the votes so far on the board...
Mr. Garrison
So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike. [sets the chalk down and reads the last ballot] And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for. [Flora, a timid, pretty blond girl trying to bury her face into her laps, which are raised up on the chair, is shown] You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?
Flora
I don't know... [smiles and looks down and away]
Mr. Garrison
Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?
Flora
Um, I vote for... I don't know.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.
Flora
Okay.
Boy #
Flora, just say you vote for Filmore so we can all go home.
Flora
Um...
Sally
No! You want Ike to be president.
Filmore
We're gonna be here all night! Why don't you guys just concede?
Two kids
Yeah!
Sally
Why don't you just concede?
Other kids
Yeah! [the kids start to argue]
Some Kids
Filmore!
Other Kids
Ike!
Girl
I want Ike to be president! [several kids from Filmore's side rush across the table to kids on Ike's side]
Mr. Garrison
Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!
South Park, day. A police car zooms down the street. Officer Barbrady flies down the road in the police cruiser with Cartman in the passenger seat and Stan, Kyle, and Kenny in the back seat. Cartman has the Trapper Tracker Keeper in his hand and is following the Trapper Keeper's signal on the Tracker's screen
Cartman
Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
Barbrady
Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder.
Cartman
[grabs Barbrady's ] It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if-- [spots "Bill"] There he is!
Bill
[turns to see the cruiser coming his way] Wagh!
Cartman
Got ya! [grabs the steering wheel from Barbrady]
Barbrady
Hey! [Cartman steers the cruiser into a building, crushing "Bill" and rattling the building]
Bill
Gaagghhh! [crumples to the floor. Barbrady and the others exit the car and gather at Bill. His left arm has been amputated, revealing functioning wires. The lower half holding the Trapper Keeper in hand. Barbrady and the boys stare in shock]
Kyle
Whoa, dude..!
End of act one. Time: 7:50
same time, later...
Cartman
Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?
Bill
Please. You do not understand.
Cartman
[takes his place] Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
Bill
[plaintive] That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!
Stan
Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?
Barbrady
Bill Cosby?
Bill
Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby. [the boys and Barbrady show shock] My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.
Barbrady
Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!
BSM-471
I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world. [cables reach out from the Trapper Keeper and engulf two computers. The process continues engulfing all of the US] It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind [skulls litter the landscape] and there was nothing the humans could do. [in the distance a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper tower rises] It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans. [people are shot left and right from the Trapper Keeper's weapons] The nations tried everything to stop it. [troops line up and fire at the Trapper Keeper] Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked. [robotic tanks come into view, firing away at the Trapper Keeper] The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them. [DC TK209s approach the advancing armies and fire at them] But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper. [the battle scene fades, and BSM-471 is shown once again on the ground] And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started.
Stan
Wow, that's amazing.
Kyle
Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
Stan
What do you think, Officer Barbrady?
Barbrady
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
BSM-471
And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper.
Cartman
[long pause] You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
Stan
Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
Cartman
What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!
Stan
Yes!
Cartman
Aw, damnit! [throws his Trapper Keeper to the ground] Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! [walks off to his left sadly]
South Park Elementary, kindergarten. The class is looking at Flora. Mr. Garrison sits on a chair looking bored
Flora
I decided.
Mr. Garrison
[jumps up] Oh, thank God, Flora! [gets ready to write] Alright, who do you vote for?
Flora
Umm... Ike.
Supporters
Yay!
Mr. Garrison
[adds the tally to Ike's total] Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president.
Filmore
We want a recount.
Mr. Garrison
[miffed] What?
Filmore's Supporters
Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby! [Filmore cries and throws a tantrum, pounding away on the classroom table] Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore... [writes Filmore's name on the board. A time lapse shows him writing on a crowded board now] ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.
Filmore
Count them again.
Supporters
Yeah!
Mr. Garrison
No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!
Kid #2
Wait, there's still that absent kid.
Fillmore
Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for his vote.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, will you grow up?!
Supporters
[clamoring] Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Absent kids count!
Mr. Garrison
Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home! [the kids leave]
South Park Elementary, hallway, next day.
BSM-471
Good morning, humans.
Stan/Kyle
Hey, Bill Cosby.
BSM-471
I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada.
Kyle
That should do it.
Stan
So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
BSM-471
Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right.
Cartman
[walks up with another Trapper Keeper] Hey, dudes.
Stan
Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
Cartman
Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one! [holds it up high] So everything worked out.
BSM-471
[frightened] Oh no!
Kyle
Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
Cartman
Why the hell not?!
Stan
Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
Cartman
Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
BSM-471
We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
Cartman
[holds his Trapper Keeper close] But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
Kyle
Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!
Cartman
Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. [moves off to his left]
Stan
Cartman!
Cartman
Ech! Screw you guys. Home. [walks away]
BSM-471
Well, that does it! [pull out a pocket phaser from his overcoat and aims it at Cartman]
Kyle
Hey! What are you doing?
BSM-471
I'm afraid I have no other choice. [pulls the phaser back] For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him.
Kyle
Oh... Okay.
Stan
Yeah, that's fine. ["Bill" aims the phaser once again] No, wait!
BSM-471
What?
Stan
Can I do it?
BSM-471
Oh, well, I suppose. [tosses the phaser to Stan]
Stan
[takes it and quickly aims] Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!
BSM-471
Wait! [grabs it back] Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother.
Stan
Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
Kyle
Yeah, that'd be faster.
Stan
He's right there.
BSM-471
I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call "compassion". It is an amazing feeling!
Stan/Kyle/ Kenny
Awww..!
South Park Elementary, kindergarten. Mr. Garrison stands before the class and begins to speak
Mr. Garrison
Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris? [she walks in with a little boy attached to IV bag on a pole. The kid hands him the ballot and coughs out an organ] Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung. [Billy starts to walk away, then stops to pick it up] Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for... [reads] Filmore.
Supporters
Yay./Hooray. [Mr. Garrison adds Billy's vote to Filmore's tally]
Sally
Wait one minute!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ.
Sally
I think the ballot were misleading. Some kids didn't understand whom they were voting for.
Mr. Garrison
There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?
Filmore
[pointing at Sally] You're just saying that, 'cause you know you're gonna lose now.
Sally
No, I'm saying that because you are a boogerface!
Filmore
Well, just you wait, 'cause my famous aunt is on huh way right now.
Mr. Garrison
Who's your famous aunt?
Filmore
My aunt Rosie, Rosie O'Donnell.
Mr. Garrison
Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here?
Filmore
Yeah, she's very active in politics. So she's gonna set all this straight.
Mr. Garrison
[resigned] Oh no..!
Cartman residence, day, Cartman's room. Cartman sets the Trapper Keeper in a tray, then secures it onto a docking bay and plugs a cable into it
Trapper Keeper
Recharging.
Cartman
Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away.
[singing his own Dawson's Creek theme song] I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be over
The ways of my Trap--
Trapper Keeper
Trapper Keeper ready to ensorb. [cables reach out and grab Cartman's computer like a giant hand, and pull it towards the Trapper Keeper]
Cartman
Oh, cool.
Trapper Keeper
Trapper Keeper, merging. [cables reach out and grab a lamp and a Wellington Bear desk clock]
Cartman
[softly] Whoa...
End of act two. Time: 13:59
Cartman residence, day, dining room. "Bill" is seated at the head of the table, with Liane and Kenny to his right, and Stan and Kyle to his left
BSM-471
And so you see, Ms. Cartman, you cannot buy your son Eric another Trapper Keeper. Not now! Not ever!
Liane
Right, because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness.
BSM-471
Correct.
Liane
Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. [starts flirting with him]
BSM-471
Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?
Liane
In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? [pulls "Bill" from the chair]
Stan
Uh-oh.
Kyle
Here we go again.
Liane
Come this way, Billy. [takes him away from the table]
Stan
Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. [he and Kenny leave the table, with Kyle following]
Cartman's room. Cartman is getting friendly with his Trapper Keeper
Cartman
Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!
I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
Stan
[knocks on the door] Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! [Cartman hops off his chair and dances to the door. He locks it and continues singing]
Cartman
Screw you guys, screw you guys
Screw you guys, scr--
Trapper Keeper
Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb.
Cartman
Huh? [walks towards his computer]
Kyle
[in the hallway, pounds on the door] Dammit, Cartman, open up!
Trapper Keeper
Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid.
Cartman
Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now? [cables come from the monitor and grab him] Ugh--!
Stan
[pounds on the door] Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. [he and Kyle now notice the groans coming from the room]
Kyle
Cartman? [inside, cables wrap tight around his face and go in, transforming his body into a grotesque hybrid, and the hybrid begins to grow] He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
Stan
You break it down!
Kyle
Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!
Stan
Not it! You lose, Kenny. [he and Kyle quickly step out of the way]
Kenny
(Awww..!) [goes to the far wall and then rushes the door, only to be plastered against the far wall...] (Argh--!) [...by the unhinged bedroom door being pushed out by the evolving Trapper Keeper. The boys are frozen in place with mouths open]
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle
You ba--! [the boys make a run for it down the hall and down the stairs as the Trapper Keeper oozes out of Cartman's room]
Cartman residence, outside. The front door opens and Stan and Kyle rush outside and away
Stan/Kyle
Agggghhh! [the Trapper Keeper bursts through every window in the house and then the house begins to crumble around it. It collapses in on itself. moves away from the house, leaving "Bill" and Liane in bed fully exposed to the elements]
Liane
[on top] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!
South Park Elementary, kindergarten. Mr. Garrison sits with the class around the table and hears some ominous noise
Mr. Garrison
What the hell is that? [walks to the window and looks out] Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom! [some of the kids slink down in their seats] Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. [the doorknob turns and the kindergartners crouch in terror]
Rosie O'Donnell
Hello, kids!
Filmore
Aunt Rosie!
Mr. Garrison
[in a panic] Run for your lives, children! [grabs a bat] I'll try to fight it off!
Filmore
That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell.
Mr. Garrison
Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.
Rosie O'Donnell
Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem?
Filmore
Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president.
Ike Supporter
No, Ike won.
Mr. Garrison
Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--
Rosie O'Donnell
Well it obviously isn't that simple, is it? I mean, you'd think a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this, but now we're gonna do it my way!
South Park, outskirts. The Trapper Keeper enters the scene and demolishes the sign
Trapper Keeper
[now with Cartman's voice] We are Trapper Keeper.
BSM-471
[on a bluff with Stan and Kyle looking at the Trapper Keeper leave town] Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!
Kyle
Why is that bad?
BSM-471
It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!
Stan
Then we have to stop it before it gets there! [leads the others off the bluff and onto a waiting cruiser. "Bill" takes the wheel and Kyle takes the passenger window seat]
Kyle
Step on it, Bill Cosby! ["Bill" starts the cruiser and drives off]
The road to Cheyenne Mountain. All is quiet. Two security guards wait at the entrance reading newspapers. The one wearing glasses looks up
Guard 2
Hey, Mark, look.
Mark
Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. [a police siren is heard, and promptly "Bill" arrives with Stan and Kyle. They hop out of the car and face the Trapper Keeper]
Stan
Cartman, you have to stop!
Trapper Keeper
We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.
BSM-471
A part of your friend must still be alive in there. [the three of them study the Trapper Keeper from a distance until Stan finds a ventilation hose coming out of it. Smoke comes out of it, and a fart is heard]
Stan
He is in there.
BSM-471
That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU.
Stan
One-two-three, not it!
Kyle
Not-- Aw, damnit..! [walks up to the hissing hose and climbs in]
Interior. Kyle makes his way in and scrambles through a field of organs until he reaches the memory core. The valves open up and suck Kyle into the core. Kyle floats through the core, à la 2001: A Space Odyssey'
Cartman
[à la HAL 9000] What are you doing, Kyle?
Kyle
I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
Cartman
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
Kyle
Screw you, fat ass!
Cartman
Hey, screw you.
Kyle
Cartman! [hits a wall with a wrench]
Cartman
Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him]
Kyle
No!
South Park Elementary, kindergarten. The kids run around arguing with each other and carry signs
Rosie O'Donnell
[sits on a chair with Filmore on her lap] Okay, so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand, and after that, we're gonna go over the votes again manually, and then--
Mr. Garrison
[throws a fit] Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it! [the kids and Rosie look at him] Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year.
Rosie O'Donnell
We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated.
Mr. Garrison
Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds! [Rosie and the kids gasp] ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids.
Rosie O'Donnell
How dare you?! I will not be preached at by a country pumpkin! [heads for the door and stands at the entrance] I'm leaving this podunk town, but in my place I'm gonna send more lawyers, statesmen and press than you have ever seen! [exits and slams the door shut]
Mr. Garrison
Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse.
End of act three. Time: 18:58
South Park, a red sunset. A picture of the four main characters of Dawson's Creek is present. Camera zooms out, revealing Trapper Keeper covering Cheyenne Mountain. A slimy appendage reaches out and grabs a phone both next to two ladies
Ladies
Aaghh! [hurry away. The Trapper Keeper absorbs the phone booth, and another of its appendages goes after a police car]
Cops
Wagghh! [hurry away. In the distance "Bill," the two security guards, and Stan watch Trapper Keeper get bigger and bigger. Behind them, the rest of South Park gathers and sees the spectacle]
Mark
Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this. [whips out a walkie-talkie and starts] Car one to base-- [another appendage reaches down and pulls him up and away] Aghh! [Trapper Keeper swallows him up]
BSM-471
It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!
Stan
Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
Interior. Kyle struggles to make his way out of the little situation he's in
Kyle
I can't reach the CPU.
Cheyenne Mountain, outside. A limo speeds up to the scene and encounters the Trapper Keeper, which is beginning to look like the tower in "Bill"'s prophecy. Rosie O'Donnell pops out and walks up to it
Rosie
What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!
Guard 2
Oh, no! Now there's two of those things!
Stan
No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. [an indecisive appendage hovers over Rosie]
Guard 2
Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double.
Rosie
[to Trapper Keeper] I said, get out of my way! [another appendage wraps around her and tries to pull her in] Aaaaggghhhh!!! [Trapper Keeper swells and heaves, and the fleshy appendage swallows Rosie up] Ogh. Noo-- [the appendage pulls her up and into Trapper Keeper]
Trapper Keeper
Eeww.
BSM-471
Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.
Trapper Keeper
Oohh... Bad pie... Bad pie... [begins to deflate and wither. Its appendages wither and begin to drop off as it darkens]
Stan
This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
Interior. Cartman releases his hold on Kyle and Kyle drops to the floor. He quickly moves to the wall panel containing the CPU and pulls the CPU out along with some memory chips
Kyle
Got 'em!
Cheyenne Mountain, outside. Trapper Keeper turns into a big mass of goo, and Kyle and Cartman are spat out. Rosie ends up half-eaten. Everybody begins to approach Kyle and Cartman
Stan
He did it!
South Park Elementary, kindergarten. The kids are seated around the round table, and their lawyers stand behind them arguing. Mr. Garrison sits at the head of the table listening
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? [the door opens, and in walks...]
Jesse Jackson
Is this the kindergarten classroom?
Mr. Garrison
Jesse Jackson?
Jesse Jackson
That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!
Mr. Garrison
[covering his face] We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
Jesse Jackson
Oh. Bye. [turns and walks out. Filmore raises his hand]
Mr. Garrison
Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--
Filmore
Mistoreh Garrison, I concede. [Mr. Garrison's jaw drops, as do those of Filmore's lawyers]
Mr. Garrison
You... yuh, you what?
Filmore
I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this game is stupid.
Sally
Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.
Filmore
Ike, you could be class president.
Ike
I pooped my pants!
Sally
[throws up her hands] Can we fingerpaint now?
Kids
[clamoring] Fingerpaint! Fingerpaint!
Mr. Garrison
Ohuh... Yes. [exults] Yes! Let's fingerpaint!
Cheyenne Mountain. Stan and the others reach Cartman and Kyle
Stan
You did it, Kyle! [to Cartman] Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
BSM-471
Look! I'm fading! [begins to fade from view] It must have worked. I don't exist! [disappears]
Stan
Huh, that's a bitch.
Cartman
Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
Stan
Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
Cartman
Awww, man...
Stan
Cartman!
Cartman
Alright, alright. [sighs] Kyle...
End of Trapper Keeper

Helen Keller! The Musical
stage, rehearsal, day. Stan, Kyle, and Wendy are in costume on stage. Stan is dressed in a white suit and bowtie, and a fake beard and mustache. Kyle is dressed as a country doctor with starched collar, and Wendy is dressed in white pants, purple coat and beret, and bowtie. The stage itself has a door prop and a tripod table with a bowl and jar atop it. Kyle enters through the door.
Wendy
Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?
Kyle
I am sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Keller, but I'm afraid your daughter Helen still cannot see, hear, or speak.
Wendy
Oh no! NO!
Stan
'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
Wendy
My poor little Helen.
Timmy
[enters through the prop door in blue dress and wig, and holding a doll - Helen Keller!] Timmiihhh!
Wendy
She can't see or hear us, John.
Timmy
Heh-aaaah, Timmih!
Stan
[very slurred - John Keller] E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
Cartman
[in the second front row, directing] Stan, what the hell is wrong with you? I can't understand your lines!
Stan
'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
Kyle
Can we take a lunch break now?
Cartman
No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
Bebe
[enters the scene] Hello. My name is Anne Sullivan, and I believe I can teach this child to communicate.
Stan
Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
Bebe
[slaps some water from a pitcher into Timmy's right hand] Water, Helen! Waaa-terr!
Timmy
Agh oh-ight, Timmih!
Cartman
God-damnit, Timmy! Helen Keller isn't supposed to talk!
Butters
[a camera follows him to the auditorium at butt level; another camera shows him entering the room] Hey you guys! We got a big problem! [rushes onto the stage]
Kyle
What is it, Butters?
Butters
The kindergartners! I just came from their dress rehearsal. Hoh, it's good, you guys. It's real good!
Cartman
How good?
Butters
They got Pilgrim outfits! And Indian ones, too! They've got singing and dancing and boy you've never seen such a show! Why, it's a Thanksgiving extravaganza!
Clyd
Oh, no!
Kyle
We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
Clyde
Oh, now what?
Stan
Oh yeah, we can't!
Cartman
Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
Kyle
Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
Cartman
Yeah, but nobody told us how we had to do it. We can have Thanksgiving stuff and music numbers, too.
Clyde
Well, we can add music numbers, but how do we make the Helen Keller story more Thanksgivingy?
Wendy
I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.
Token
Yeah, a turkey that could do tricks.
Kids
Yeah
Cartman
That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
Kyle
Okay!
Cartman
This is gonna be the best version of the Miracle Worker ever!
Kids
Yay!
a barn, with no snow around it. Cows are grazing on the grass outside. Inside, a rancher shows Timmy and Kyle around the barn.
Rancher
What kind of turkey are you lookin' for?
Kyle
A smart one, that can do tricks.
Rancher
Well, I ain't got a whole lot left, it bein' almost Thanksgiving and all. [opens a turkey pen so the boys can see] Go ahead, just pick one out. [Timmy looks pleased, looks around, and settles on a deformed turkey which walks with its head against the ground]
Timmy
[apparently having chosen his turkey] Timmaay! [the turkey blinks at him]
Rancher
[notices the turkey] Oh, that one's a little messed up. Not exactly the... pick of the litter.
Timmy
Haaaaa!
Kyle
Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
Timmy
TIMMAY!
Rancher
Yeah. Best you not take that one. I was just about to take it out in the yard and putt a bullet in its head.
Kyle
What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!
Timmy
T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!
Kyle
Alright, we'll take him. How much?
Rancher
Fifty bucks.
Kyle
But you were just gonna take it out in the backyard and put a bullet in its head!
Rancher
I know! Now I gotta find somethin' else to shoot.
Kyle
[thinks] ...God-damnit, here! [the rancher takes the money, walks over to get the turkey, and delivers the turkey to Timmy] Alright, Timmy, let's go! [Kyle and Timmy leave]
Rancher
I've got a one-legged pig if you'd like, too.
Kyle
Aw, blow it out your ass!
The South Park Community Theatre. Here is where the class has been rehearsing for the play. The marquee reads: "THANKSGIVING EXTRAVAGANZA WEDNESDAY" Inside, Cartman has most of the kids on stage with a man...
Cartman
Guys, I want you all to meet Jeffrey Maynard. He's South Park's biggest expert on musical theater, AND, he played the lead in Les Misérables at the Denver Community Playhouse for five weeks.
Kids
[flatly] Bravo.
Wendy
Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
Jeffrey Maynard
[lyrically] I would swear it on my life. Your play shall want for nothing.
Kids
Hooray!
Jeffrey Maynard
Now, the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number. Something that sets up the entire show.
Cartman
Alright! Places, everybody! Bring in the turkey! [Timmy's turkey sidles in with its head on the ground. Kyle and Timmy follow] What the hell is that?
Kyle
It's a turkey. [long pause] His name is Gobbles.
Timmy
GOBBLES! [Gobbles gobbles]
Cartman
And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
Kyle
Um, we... sssort of spend all the money on this... one...
Timmy
GOBBLES! [Gobbles gobbles]
Cartman
[looks at Kyle for a long time] Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second? [they walk off to one side of the stage and stop, out of earshot] Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
Kyle
I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
Cartman
You say, "No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!"
Kyle
[the rest of the cast approaches] Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
?????
He's not gonna work, Kyle. The whole point was to make our play better than the kindergartners.
Token
Yeah, that turkey sucks.
Jeffrey Maynard
[lyrically] Wait! What's that, you say? A thanksgiving turkey is what you require? I know of a turkey.
Stan
You do?
Jeffrey Maynard
[lyrically] During my years on Broadway I... worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks. She even jumped through a hoop of fire.
Cartman
Cool! Can you get it for us?
Jeffrey Maynard
I will go promptly and call her trainer. On the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey.
Kids
Alright! [Timmy takes Gobbles and wheels off stage]
South Park, Timmy's house, night. Timmy is in his room with a hula hoop in hand, sitting on the floor
Timmy
Gobbles! [shows him the hoop and points to it. Gobbles just blinks. Timmy tries again] Gobbles! [Gobbles blinks, then walks up to the hoop and lifts his head through it. Timmy is dismayed] Up, heh. Uh! [coaxes Gobbles through the hoop. Gobbles trips and falls out. Timmy grins] Heeey, Gobbles! [Gobbles gets up and walks away. Timmy pulls out a lighter and sets the hoop aflame] Gobbles. [Gobbles just stares and Timmy urges] Gobbles! [Gobbles poops]
South Park, Cartman's house, night. Cartman is in his room rewriting a part of the play.
Cartman
No no! [tosse another sheet over his shoulder, to join other wads on the floor. His mother enters the room]
Liane
Boopsie-kins, It's late. You need to be in bed.
Cartman
I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
Liane
Now, hon!
Cartman
[whining a bit] But [turns around] Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
Liane
Twenty more minutes, and that's it. [exits and closes the door]
Cartman
[spins around and gets back to work] Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to "Phantom Of The Opera"?! [looks at a small portrait of Helen Keller on his desk, picks it up and studies it] Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice. [after looking at the portrait some more, he gets frustrated and slams the portrait onto the desk] Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
South Park, Timmy's house. Timmy is in bed asleep. Soon, Gobbles hops up on the bed and drops his head on the covers. He slowly inches up to Timmy's face, looking at Timmy all the while, and settles in next to him. Gobbles soon falls asleep. Timmy's left hand comes to rest on Gobbles' body. An exterior shot with the moon low in the sky is shown and fades out.
The South Park Community Theatre, the stage, next day. rehearsal. Clyde is speaking under a spotlight
Clyde
Tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
Cartman
[in the audience] OP-pression!
Clyde
Oppression. Our play begins in a simpler time. [music comes up] Alabama, in the late 1800s [spotlight goes off, Clyde walks off stage, curtains open. A lone house stands against a desert background and clouds float high against the sky-blue backdrop. Dancing singers begin]
Actors
1800's, Alabama! What a great place and time!
We're so happy that we live in 1800's Alabama 'cause it's sunny and there is no crime!

Jeffrey
[in the audience] Now to the refrain!
Actors
And in this little town in 1800's Alabama there's a family by the name of Keller!
[They dance off to one side of the house. A water pump appears]
Their daughter's deaf and mute and blind as a bat, and her parents can't even tell her!!

Lamond
[a man with a small animal cage enters] Excuse me, I am Lamond, the animal trainer.
Clyde
Oh. [quickly calls the others] Cool! He's here! [the other kids gather]
Cartman
Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
Lamond
Ap ap! Do not call them tricks! She's a very sensitive turkey! She performs feats, not tricks. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the most beautiful bird in America! [sets the cage down] Four-time prize winner of the National Western Stock Show and reigning poster child of turkeylovers.com! I give you Alinicia! [one serious turkey walks out of the cage, and the kids are impressed]
Cartman
Yeh.
Others
Wow.
Cartman
Whoa.
Bebe
Her feathers are beautiful.
Clyd
That's the prettiest turkey I ever saw.
Lamond
Of course she is! [she looks back at the kids and thrusts her beak in the air]
Cartman
Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody! [the kids move back...] Where the hell is Timmy?
Timmy
[off screen] TIM-MIH! [all turn and face him. He's in costume with Gobbles before him. Gobbles raises his head and gobbles]
Lamond
What... is... that?!
Cartman
Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. [Timmy takes his lighter and sets his hoop on fire, then lowers it for his bird]
Timmy
Gobbles! [Gobbles makes no move] Gobbles?!
Kyle
Timmy, we already got a turkey.
Clyde
Yeah, and it's from Broadway.
Timmy
[indicates his turkey] Gobbles.
Cartman
No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
Kyle
Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
Cartman
No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
Timmy
[stubborn] Tim-mih.
Cartman
Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! [Alinicia protests vigorously, shedding feathers everywhere]
Lamond
My turkey does not work with other turkeys!
Cartman
Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
The South Park Community Theatre, later. Hallway outside a dressing room. The door opens and Lamond stands there trying to calm Alinicia down
Lamond
Alright, ah ah alright! Alri- ah a-alright. Alright. [exits and closes the door]
Cartman
[walks up] Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
Lamond
She's not coming out. She's very upset! She's pooped all over the room!
Cartman
I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
Lamond
[ominously] Kill the other turkey!
Cartman
I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
Lamond
Well, it could meet with "an unfortunate accident."
Cartman
Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show? [laughs, but realizes he's alone in this] Oh.
Lamond
It's very simple! Either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident, or you don't have a feat-performing turkey for your Helen Keller Thanksgiving musical!
Cartman
Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. [walks off]
The South Park Community Theatre, the stage, later. Bebe and Timmy are front and center while the others stand in a row in the background
Bebe
[enunciating] Water, Helen. It has a name. Oh, why can't you understand?
Timmy
Dehh haaa. [unimpressed looks from Cartman, Jeffrey, and Lamond]
Bebe
Water, Helen, Water.

Kids
She's never gonna do it. There's no way she'll ever do it.

Bebe
Helen, Helen. Water, Helen.

Kids
How can she talk if she can't hear? This is absolutely pointless!

Cartman
Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second. [whisks himself onstage] Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2 [starts moving Gobbles along] stand just a little bit more over... [puts it behind the Comedy Central logo] here. [mulls over the position] Let's see, maybe a little more up in here. [moves it a bit towards stage center] And just a wee bit over here. [Gobbles is back behind the logo, a bit] And right about... [moves Gobbles a bit back] hm'ere. [steps back] There we go. Good. [goes off stage. A cable whips out of place somewhere. A lighting fixture falls on Kenny and kills him]
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Jeffrey
Whoa-aaaa [dances away]
Cartman
Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
Jeffrey
[onstage, walks up to Kenny's corpse, then gets lyrical] Let him rest in peace. Let him rest. Why must he die?
Butters
[a camera follows him to the auditorium at butt level; another camera shows him entering the room] They've got special effects! [Jeffrey continues singing in the background]
Kyle
What Butters? [Butters meets the others onstage]
Butters
The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
Wendy
Oh, no!
Clyde
We're never gonna outdo them now! [the kids begin to chatter amongst themselves]
Token
But what are we gonna do?
Cartman
[Jeffrey continues his dirge] Calm down! Calm down! We can have special effects, too. Now, I know a lot is going wrong, but we've got to stick together to make this play work! [looks at Lamond] All of us! [Lamond crosses his arms]
Jeffrey
—and into your hands [the kids now pay attention to him] uh he... buh... [hums, then stops singing, stares, then gets up and walks offstage]
The South Park Community Theatre, the stage, later. Timmy is in another hallway trying to get Gobbles to hop through the hoop
Timmy
Gobbles! [Gobbles lifts his head and drops it away from Timmy] Hu-ugh, Gobbles! [they hear the door open. Timmy puts the hoop away and gathers Gobbles on his lap]
Lamond
[peeks in] Little boy.
Timmy
[spins around] Timmy.
Lamond
Yes, Tim. I feel I must speak with you. [walks up to Timmy] The others, well, they don't want you to know, but, oh, I don't know what to do. Should I tell you?
Timmy
T-Timmih? [a bit afraid]
Lamond
I feel I'm the only one who can be honest with you. [genuflects next to Timmy] The animal shelter is on its way to...take your turkey away from you.
Timmy
Gobbles? [scared]
Lamond
You see, they don't allow children in your... situation... to have wild animals as pets. You can't take him running, you can't take care of him. They... have to take it away.
Timmy
Gobbles!
Lamond
They take wild pets away from people like you... and hand them over for experiments. And they're shocked, dissected, and flayed while they're still alive. And no matter where you go, the shelter people will find you. The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go. Back into the wild. [listens for something] Oh no! Here they come now! [two men round the corner] Quick, go! And set your turkey free! I'll try to stall them.
Timmy
[turns and wheels away from the oncoming men] T-tim-mih.
Installer
Eh, excuse me, we're here to install the water effects for the musical?
Lamond
Uh, the stage is right through there.
Installer
Thanks. [he and his partner walk towards the stage. Lamond looks after them as they leave]
South Park, Cartman's house, night. Cartman is at his desk in his room rewriting a song.
Cartman
Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see. [writes] no [writes] No. [writes] NO! [writes] God-damnit [takes the sheet and squeezes it into a wad]
Jeffrey
[enters the room] How is it going, Eric?

Cartman
Terrible! [turns and faces Jeffrey] I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
Jeffrey
Well, you know in theater sometimes, we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing.
Cartman
Like what?
Jeffrey
Let's see. [closes the door behind him] Helen Keller was blind and deaf. [walks to Cartman's side desk] Perhaps you should see what it is like. Deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind. Here. [turns Cartman around and puts a blindfold on him.]
Cartman
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Jeffrey
[puts some headphones on him] Just relax. Just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow... [a long pause. then a series of images present themselves]
First, the portrait of Helen Keller. Then nothing. Then Helen Keller again, then a banana split, then Helen again, then a human skull. Cartman is disturbed. Then Helen, the skull, another skull, Helen, a mummy whose hair moves a bit, bombs dropping from planes, a sinister clown, the banana split, a body being prepped for operation, the banana split, a wall with "GO DEAD BE DEAD" written in blood on it, a Russian show of military might, Helen, animals tearing at something, a riot, a close-up of a snake, an atomic bomb test, a lasik experiment. Cartman. The first skull, "GO DEAD BE DEAD", the skull, the experiment, the skull, the experiment, a woman wailing in the flames, open-heart surgery, a rat eating a dead rat, the banana split, a mouth being pulled open, Helen, a Nazi troop march, a fireman in an inferno, the Hindenburg bursting in flame, an alien opening its mouth and the camera zooms in... Cartman takes the blindfold and headphones off
Cartman
Oh, man!
Jeffrey
Well, did you see anything?
Cartman
No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
Jeffrey
...Oh, that's too bad.
Cartman
Wait. I've got it! The perfect setup for when Helen Keller's pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire! [starts writing furiously] Yes! Yes! I have it now!
South Park, residential street, day. Timmy rolls along dejected and turns to another street. He remembers what Lamond said as he rolls
Lamond
[his head appears beside Timmy] The only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to... let him go... [fades as it echoes] let him go... let him go...[the head disappears]
Timmy
[stops and lets Gobbles go] Gobbles! [points away so Gobbles could leave. Gobbles moves his head in that direction, but nothing else] Gobbles!! [turns around and rolls away. Gobbles follows him and gobbles. Timmy turns around again and face Gobbles] Gobbles. Gobbles! [points away again, turns and rolls away. Gobbles follows some more] Timmih. [a tear appears in his eye] Timmih, Gobbles. [turns away and rolls off, leaving Gobbles alone. The camera pulls back and moves to the first house on the right side. A man and son sit on their doorway]
Boy
Daddy, why did Mommy leave and go to heaven?
Father
She didn't want to, Kevin. She... had no choice.
Boy
But I miss her. [father and son start to cry. The camera moves to a bench on which two men sit]
Elderly man
[his middle-aged son comforts him] I could have so much more with my life, son. I've wasted it. I've wasted it, not ever telling you and Mark that I love you. [both men start to cry. The camera moves to Heidi Turner crying over a dead dog.]
Heidi
Robby! Robby, no! [cries uncontrollably. The camera moves to a couple in discord. the woman is sad]
Woman
...Because now, every time I look at you [he tries to console her], I see her! [she swats his arm away] I have to move on.
Man
Kelly, please. Don't do this. I'm sorry.
Kelly
Then why did you do it?? [breaks down and sobs]
Man
I don't know! [beings to cry, too, and rests his head on her shoulder. The camera moves to a lady with something to say]
Lady
Have you done the right things in your life? [the camera looks up into the sky as it fades into night]
The South Park Community Theatre, Wednesday, play day. The parents arrive and take seats. Mrs. Marsh finds Mrs. Broflovski siting in the audience already, and walks up to her
Sharon
Hi, Sheila.
Sheila
Hello, Sharon. Where's your husband?
Sharon
Oh, he's in the back. He set up a video camera so he can tape the performance.
Sheila
Oh, so did Gerald. [indeed, all the husbands are in the back of the theatre with video cameras at the ready]
Gerald
Oh yeah, I got a great angle here.
Randy
Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.
Gerald
Good idea.
The South Park Community Theatre, stage. The kids mill around backstage
Kyle
So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
Stan
No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. [Timmy rolls slowly in ]
Kyle
You ready for the big show, Timmy?
Stan
Where's Gobbles, Timmy?
Timmy
Gobbles.
Cartman
[cheerfully] Alright everybody, let's take our places!
Kyle
Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?
Cartman
I don't know. [Stan and Kyle cross their arms] I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
Lamond
You're going to be brilliant, you sexy, gorgeous turkey. With that other meddling animal out of the way, you'll steal the show! [Alinicia gobbles]
South Park, business district, day. Gobbles walks along the curb as cars zip by, then decides to cross the street. A car zips be and Gobbles steps back. The camera angle shows Gobbles' view of the car that almost ran over him
Driver
[walks up to collect Gobbles] Well, well, what are doing out here? [picks him up] You shouldn't be out walking the streets. [opens his truck, tosses Gobbles in, and rushes to the cab of the truck. The side of the truck reads, "Uncle Joe's Fresh Turkey. Succulent and Juicy Turkeys," with a plump turkey in the background. The driver takes off quickly]
Uncle Joe's Fresh Turkey truck, trailer section. Gobbles finds himself along near the doors and looks up to see a group of turkeys looking back at him. Then the turkeys look up, and Gobbles does also. What they see is a sign that reads, "Thanksgiving Turkey. Killed Humanely." Gobbles looks at the turkeys, who look back, and then drops his head
The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Mr. Garrison is present to introduce the show.
Mr. Garrison
Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant.
Mr. Mackey
[bored, rests his head on his hand] Every year the fourth graders do "The Miracle Worker," and every year I have to sit and watch it.
Principal Victoria
Yeah, I swore that if I had to see it one more time, I'd put a bullet in my head. [demonstrates with her finger] But luckily I got really stoned before I came.
Mr. Garrison
And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, "The Miracle Worker." [walks off. The parents are seen clapping, and then the curtains open up to reveal kids dancing and doing acrobatic feats]
Kids
Helen Keller, Helen Keller, blind as a bat.
She can't hear us speak. What's up with that?

Sheila
This is "The Miracle Worker"?
Sharon
I... well... maybe. [more dancing follows]
Principal Victoria
Oh, oh, haha. Wow.
Uncle Joe's Fresh Turkey factory. The truck backs up to building 2B and dumps its cargo into a chute. The turkeys tumble down into a holding room and recover. Gobbles ends up there and looks up at a sign: "Our Turkeys are killed... HUMANELY!!!"
Wrangler
[a vertical door rises and he directs the turkeys] Come on. Yaah! Move it!
the turkeys leave the room and enter another one. A movie screen faces them. Another worker appears and closes the door behind the turkeys. The turkeys remain excited until a movie comes up with sweeping views of nature. The turkeys calm down, and a view of clouds zipping along the sky follows. Then waterfalls. The lights come up and a giant saw comes out and chops the heads off all the turkeys save one. The saw rises. Only Gobbles survives, and he keeps his head low as he finds a clearing. A large board appears and pushes the decapitated turkeys out an opening on the opposite wall. The bodies are then lifted up and returned to the truck they came in, but the building they come out of is 3C. Gobbles falls off the truck and ends up on the floor. Jimbo and other South Park hunters pass by and notice
Jimbo
Holy crow. Look, boys! A real live wild turkey! [Gobbles sees the hunters and tries to run away.] It's tryin' to outsmart us! Come on, fellas! [they pursue Gobbles]
The South Park Community Theatre, stage. The audience watches as Wendy
Wendy
John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick

[Stan rushes in]

When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch.

Stan
No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.

Wendy
She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!
Stan
Helen!
Wendy
...Helen! [the audience stares in disbelief]

I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!

Stan
Oh no! [they lean on each other]
Wendy
Oh no! Oh no!!! [both collapse to the floor, and the curtains close. Alinicia trots in and gets the spotlight. She then performs her feats. She hops up on a small stand, walks a tightrope, and hops off the stand at the other end. She hops through a hoop and lands on a third stand, then pulls the cover off a sign introducing the next scene: "Scene 2, Eight Years Later" and takes a bow. A few people clap]
The South Park Community Theatre, backstage. Timmy and Lamond watch Alinicia perform.
Lamond
She's brilliant! Everyone loves her so far. [the two workers approach him]
Cartman
[rushes up] Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
Installer
Look, we're only here to do the water effects. We're not in charge of electrical. That's a different union.
Timmy
[looks at Cartman] Timmih?
Cartman
Union Mafia bastards! [Timmy looks at Lamond in fear]
Lamond
Oh, heh. Look, Tim, all is well in love and theatre, right? Haha.
Timmy
[throws off his wig and turns to wheel away] Gobbles!! [zips out]
The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Cartman rushes up to the other kids
Cartma
Were is Timmy?! He's on in one minute!
Kyle
He's gone, dude! Butters says he saw him leave.
Cartman
Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
Jeffrey
[approaches the boys] I do. I know the part. If I must, I can go on.
Cartman
...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
South Park, business district, day. Timmy wheels down the street past Tele's calling out...
Timmy
Gobbles! Gobbles!
The barn. Gobbles returns to his prior home, and the hunters follow him there
Jimbo
[prepares his rifle] There it is! [three other men prepare their rifles] Hey, hey! I saw it first! I get the first shot! [aims his rifle and spots the turkey] Here, turkey turkey. [focuses on the turkey]
The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, and Jeffrey are in costume
Wendy
There is nothing we can do for our poor daughter. We cannot reach her.
Jeffrey
[lyrically] I cannot hear what they are saying. I cannot tell them how I feel [in disbelief]
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!

Cartman
What the hell is he doing? Helen Keller isn't supposed to sing!
Jeffrey
If only I could say things that go on in my mind. [in disbelief]

I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!

Principal Victoria
[touched] Oh, wow.
The barn. Jimbo still has Gobbles in his sights
Jimbo
That's it. Thaaat's it! [about to pull the trigger]
Timmy
Gobbles! [sees Jimbo and is alarmed]
Jimbo
Gotcha!
Timmy
[Slow motion, jumps out of his chair and dives towards] Gobbles! [flies through the air. Jimbo fires his rifle, and Timmy falls on the floor limp. Jimbo sees what he's done, and all the hunters lower their rifles. Gobble's head pops up behind Timmy. The other hunters whistle and move away slowly, leaving Jimbo and Ned alone. Gobbles walks up to Timmy and nudges him] T-timmih? [Gobbles pokes him] Gobbles? [slowly comes to, then quickly sits up] Gobbles! Haaaah. [brushes himself off and gathers Gobbles up in his arms]
Jimbo
[rushes up to Timmy and is relived that he's okay] Aw, thank God you're alright, kid. [goes down on one knee] It was an accident, I swear. Uh, is there any way we can make it up to you?
Timmy
[determined] Timmih.
The South Park Community Theatre, stage. Bebe, and Jeffrey are in costume. Bebe pumps water onto Jeffrey's hand
Bebe
Yes, that's it. [Jeffrey keeps his hand under the water] That's it, Helen. Water! WA-TER!
Jeffrey
Wawa.
Bebe
She did it!
Kids
[in the background, come forward] She did it! She did it! Water! Water water aaaaaaaa!
Water, Helen, Water.
We can't believe she did it. The dumb kid really did it.
Water, Helen, Water.

Jeffrey
Now that I can communicate the world is not so cold and dark. [Cartman slaps his head and the waterworks begin]

Kids
[slowing] Water, Helen, Aaa-aaaaaa!
[the waterworks go up real high and two fountainheads crash into each other]

Lamond
[prepping Alinicia] Here it comes, angel! Your big finale! The audience is going to go wild! [a shadow enters the scene and Lamond looks up. He sees Gobbles and an angry Timmy with arms crossed glaring at him] Oh. Back already? Don't worry. Maynard covered your part flawlessly.
Timmy
Timmih! [the hunters gather and take aim at Alinicia]
Jimbo
Turkey shoot! [the hunters fire away and decimate Alinicia. Her blood spurts all over Lamond, who shields his eyes.]
Lamond
[He falls on one knee at the horror] Alinicia! Jesus, no!
Timmy
Aaaa, Timmih!
Cartman
[walks up with Kyle] Okay, we're ready for the- [stops in his tracks and stares at the dead Alinicia.] What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
Kyle
[steps forward and points] Hey, look! [onstage, Gobbles approaches the ring of fire and steps through it. The kids grin immediately]
Principal Victoria
[in awe] Oh. Oh, wow! WOWuh! [starts to clap. The audience soon follows]
Cartman
[exults] They loved it! They LOVED it!
Timmy
Gobbles!
The South Park Community Theatre, stage, night. Mr. Garrison is onstage to introduce the last skit of the night
Mr. Garrison
And finally tonight, parents, we have the South Park Kindergarten class. Their play is titled, "Thanksgiving, Mon Ami."
Stan
Okay, here we go. [the kids are still backstage, but in their street clothes]
Kyle
Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
Kindergartners
[four little pilgrims enter singing badly to a long table in front of a cabin and a tipi]
It's getting dinner. Let's all eat.
E I E I O.
And on that dinner we'll invite some Indians
E I E I O.
[four little Indians appear and take their seats at the table]
With an Indian here and an Indian there
Everywhere an Indian, Indian. Uh thank, thank-
[something pops by the middle of the table...]

Pilgrim Girl
[runs off] Aaaaaaa!
Kindergartners
Happy Thanksgiving. [another kindergartner wheels a horse prop onstage. The curtains then close]
Mr. Garrison
Alright, see you next year, parents. [a hush falls over the audience and the actors backstage]
Cartman
That's it?
Stan
We worked our asses off to compete with that?!
Kyle
Butters told us their play was awesome! [the kids move away from Butters a bit]
Butters
...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
Timmy
Gobbles, deh!
End of Helen Keller! The Musical

Pip
The camera pans across a nicely appointed study, rests a bit, and "South Park Classics" appears on screen as a classical piece plays
A British Person
[seated in an armchair reading a book] Aaah. [looks at the camera] Dickens. The imagery of cobblestone streets, cragging London buildings, and nutmeg-filled Yorkshire puddings. [closes the book] Hello, I'm a British person. For years now, the character Pip has been featured prominently in the American show, South Park. However, many Americans don't realize where Pip came from. He's the prowling little adorable Englishman from Charles Dickens' timeless classic, "Great Expectations" [displays the title] And so tonight, the makers of South Park have agreed to take a break from their regular show, and instead present the prestigious Dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end. Indeed, after watching this show, you'll know the timeless classic as if you'd... read the Cliff Notes themselves. Our story is set in England, in the small town of Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, [the town is now shown, with Pip walking up the street from a distance] where a young blond-haired boy named Pip was on his way to see his parents.
Drop-A-Chair-Upon-Top-Snot, day. Pip leaves the town, crosses an open field, enters an enclosed lot and stops right in front of the camera
Pip
[holding a bunch of flowers] 'Ello Mom. 'Ello Dad. It certainly is nice to see you again. [before him are two tombstones. They are of his parents, Phillip and Georgina Pirrip. Pip is in the town graveyard.] Don't worry. Sister is still taking very good care of me. She just loves to smack me in the face and tell me I'm worthless. O, we have such fun together. [a wind comes up and begins to howl. Pip takes notice] But it's getting dark, Mom and Dad. I'll see you again soon. [walks off, but there's a fear in him as he walks through the graveyard. He has his hands in his coat pockets. He is snatched up from behind] Wa-a-ah!
Ex-Convict
Wha' are you doin' 'ere, you little whippersham!
Pip
[fearless] Oh, hello. Why, you look like an escaped convict. Did we breaky-wakys out of prison? [the surprised man lets him down] Oh dear! But you're shackled. Here, let me help you. [whips out some bolt cutters]
Ex-Convict
Wha' are you doin' wit' those?
Pip
I'm an apprentice blacksmith. [snips the arm and leg shackles in two] There you are. [puts the bolt cutters away and whips out some food] And here's a sandwich. You must be starving! [the man takes the sandwich, then walks away]
Ex-Convict
[stops and turns] Here. W-why are you easy to help me?
Pip
Well, it's not for me to judge you, sir. We are all the same. [the man turns and walks away] Don't quite all smell the same, I'm afraid. [walks out of the graveyard towards his residence, a rambling one-story shack. The sound of smithing is heard in the background]
Mrs. Joe
[sees him enter and grabs him by the scarf] Pip, where 'ave you been?!
Pip
Waaah! [is whipped towards the opposite wall, which he hits hard, but he recovers instantly] Lovely day, isn't it?
Mrs. Joe
What the hell's lovely about it?! [to someone else - a burly man working on some metal] Joe, teach this boy some bloody cynicism!
Joe
I don't know about that. I just thought I'd keep to me blacksmithing. [looks at his project] Ey, look! I've made me a metal fire poker. [holds it up]
Mrs. Joe
A lot of bloody good a fire poker's gonna do while I'm starvin' to death! Why don't you make us some bloody food to eat!
Joe
[finishes another item and sets down his hammer] Alright. Look 'ere, I made me a metal orange. [shows it off]
Mrs. Joe
STOP your metal orange, you bastard! You never want a tablespoon of nigh'ingale droppin's, you me'al-poundin' fairy! [Pip is shown] And you! Why don't you ge' a job?! You're eight years old now!
Joe
[finishing yet another project] Oh, lookie heeah! [holds up a newspaper] I've gone and made a metal newspaper!
Mrs. Joe
Shut up, you silly lip! What are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper?
Joe
Well, for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find Pip a job. Ohhh, lookie here! Young man wanted for paid position!
Mrs. Joe
Where? [Joe shows her the paper]
Pip
Where?
Mrs. Joe
"Havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter. Will pay up to..." TWENTY QUID A DAY??
Pip
That's a lot of [hops] money-loney.
Joe
You can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day, Pip. And Old Mrs. Havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town. [Mrs. Joe walks away]
The Havisham Residence is shown from the gates, next day.
The South Park Classics study. The British is seated in an armchair reading a book
A British Person
Well, the very next day, Pip went to Old Ms. Havisham's house to inquire about the job. [Pip rings the door bell pulley at Havisham Estate, then a shot of A British Person] and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams.
A girl approached the gate at the Havisham Residence. She's got flowing blonde hair and a bowler for a hat
Girl
Who are you?! [there's venom in her voice]
Pip
...I've come to answer the want ad.
Girl
Is that so, you smelly little bastard?!
Pip
[jarred] What??
Girl
[opens the gate and lets him in] This way, you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge! [leads him to the entrance and through the front doors, then to their left] This way, you beef-witted shriveled-up monkey's penis. [leads him up the grand stairway] Up here, you gamy mass of baby vomit! [the place suffers from neglect, as spiderwebs hang from the chandeliers and walls around the mansion. The windows are covered over with paper. The girl leads Pip down the hall upstairs] In here.
Pip
Eho. After you, miss.
Girl
I'm not going in there, you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine!
The Havisham Estate, upstairs. Pip enters a grand dining room in which everything is covered, and has been for a long time. He scans the room until a voice gets his attention.
Ms. Havisham
[an elderly lady still in wedding veil] Who is that?
Pip
I've come to answer the want ad, ma'am.
Ms. Havisham
[beckons] Come closer. Look at me. [Pip closes the door and approaches] Does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years?
Pip
Oh, no, no! You you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these... days.
Ms. Havisham
I sometimes have sick fancies. [puts her hands together] And I have a fancy I should like to see someone play. So, play. Play.
Pip
[not sure what she wants] Um. [begins to dance. The girl enters, glances at him, then continues to Ms. Havisham]
Ms. Havisham
Estella, play with this boy.
Estella
[the blonde girl] With HIM? [Pip dances faster] But he's just a commoner!
Ms. Havisham
[leans over and whispers] But, you can break his heart.
Estella
...Alright, boy, let us play.
Pip
Righty-o. What are we going to play?
Estella
[walks over to a wood pile, gets a log, and brings it with her] We're going to play a little game called, "Smack the Blond Boy In the Head With a Large Log."
Pip
[hops excitedly] Oh, yes! My sister and I play that game at home all the time! [gladly bows to Estella] Who will go first? [Estella is taken aback by this gesture, as is Ms. Havisham]
Estella
[frustrated] Oh, you stupid pathetic boy! [drops the log and rushes out of the room unnerved. Pip looks up quizzically]
Ms. Havisham
What do you think of her?
Pip
Well, uh... I think she's very pretty.
Ms. Havisham
Hm-m-m. What else?
Pip
I think she's rather insulting.
Ms. Havisham
Hm, you quite fancy her, don't you? Come back again next week. We shall "play" some more. [Pip turns and exits the room.]
The blacksmith's house, night. Pip returns to his sister's place and gets ready to bed for the night. He falls asleep
A British Person
[Off-screen] That night, Pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get Estella's beautiful face out of his mind.
Dream Estella
Stop dreaming about me, you slow-witted rectal belch!
A British Person
Day after day Pip visited Estella. Sometimes they would play, sometimes they would talk. But every single day Pip's love for Estella grew.
The Havisham Estate, garden, day. Estella is whacking Pip over the head with her log. Twice she does it, then tries a third time, but can't
Pip
[stands up straight] Don't you wanna play anymore?
Estella
[tosses her log away] Boy, do you still think I'm pretty? [draws near]
Pip
Oho. Well, yes, miss.
Estella
And, do you still think I'm insulting?
Pip
Oh, um, not so much as before. [slapped by Estella] Ow!
Estella
I hate you! You're an oozing, painful hemorrhoid that belches pus!
Pip
[exasperated. puts hands in coat pockets] Oh, dear.
Estella
You may kiss me if you like. [offers her cheek. He looks, then kisses her on the cheek. She softens] Come. Let us walk in the daisy garden. [she leads him past a fountain in which a boy is splashing about merrily]
A Boy
Oh, what fun it is to splash about in the fountain! [points at Pip] You there, the prowling little boy! I bet you can't jump on my back! [shows Pip his back] Go on, then. Try and jump on my back!
Pip
Who is that?
Estella
Just another playmate hired to amuse me. You didn't think you were the only one, did you?
Pip
Oh I... rather thought I was.
Estella
Oh, you silly small-testicled boy. Come, let us walk through the rose garden. [takes his hand and leads him onward]
The Havisham Estate, exterior. The camera looks at the second floor, focusing on Ms. Havisham
Ms. Havisham
Yes, good. She will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces.

Well, what a spot poor Pip was in. He was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful Estella. And although she treated him like dirt, or perhaps because she treated him like dirt, Pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day. [excitedly] Oh, bless him! Isn't he lovely?? [the cheer vanishes] But, isn't it sad? Because Pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as Estella could never love him, for he was just a simple blacksmith's apprentice.
The blacksmith's house, night. Joe is working on another creation. Pip watches
Joe
[hammering away] And so you bang on this side, and bang on that side, and there you have it. [holds up some steel dice and hands them to Pip.] Your very own metal fuzzy dice.
Pip
[takes the dice] Yes. I see. [walks to a chair and sits in it] Hoh, lovely.
Joe
Eeyyyy, what's all this, Pip?
Pip
Joe, do you know anything about girls?
Joe
[resumes hammering] Sure! They're those things with vaginas in them.
Pip
[blank look then] But, do you know anything about them? About how they work.
Joe
[pauses and looks back at Pip] Oh, I don't know about that. I just like to keep to me blacksmithin'. [begins to hammer more vigorously]
Pip
Do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith?
Joe
Oh. D'ooooh. No, I don't think so, Pip. [a knock is heard at the door] Who could that be? [goes to answer the door. A lawyer, with cane and tall hat, addresses him]
Lawyer
Joe, the blacksmith?
Joe
The same.
Lawyer
I'm a lawyer from London in search of a young lad named Pip.
Pip
I'm Pip, sir.
Lawyer
Mr. Blacksmith, I've been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice. [walks over to Pip]
Joe
Oh, well, uh Pip's not for sale, sir.
Lawyer
I have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future. Anything he desires. [Joe approaches] Do you still object?
Joe
Heaven forbid I should stand in the way of Pip's future, but-
Lawyer
He will one day inherit a handsome property. But the owner of that property wants him first to travel to London and learn to be a gentleman.
Joe
That's great news! [Pip grins]
Lawyer
There's only one condition, Pip. Your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous.
Pip
Oho. But it must be Ms. Havisham!
Lawyer
OH OH! If you have any suspicion of who that person might be, you are to keep it in your own breast. Understood?
Pip
Yes sir.
Lawyer
Then you will go to London in a week's time. [deposits some money on the table] Here's 20 sterling. Well, blacksmith, you look stunned.
Joe
I am, sir.
Lawyer
Then I should take my leave. [heads for the door] Good evening, gentlemen, and we shall see you in London next week, Pip. [exits]
Pip
Good-bye, sir.
Joe
[picks Pip up] Pip! [close-up on a grinning Pip] A young gentleman! Of great expectations!
London, a foggy night. Big Ben peals in the background. The camera pans down from the skyline to a horse-drawn carriage, which comes to a stop. Pip and the lawyer get out
Lawyer
You shall stay here with your roommate, Mr. Pocket. He is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman. I trust you see no problem with this?
Pip
None, sir.
Lawyer
I should think not. [taps his cane on the ground twice] On up, then, and prepare for school on the morrow.
Pip
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. [goes to the residence and opens the front door, then enters]
The Dormitory. Pip walks down the hall and finds a door with his name under that of Mr. Pocket. He is about to knock when a boy opens the door
A Boy
Mr. Pip? [it's the same one seen in the fountain earlier]
Pip
Mr. Pocket?
Pocket
Pray, come in! [drags him in.]
Pip
Thank you kindly. You do look rather familiar
Pocket
As do you. Perhaps we've seen each other before. As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid. This is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth. [leads Pip to the bedrooms] This is my little room - rather musty, and this is your bedroom. [displays the next room over]
Pip
My, how lovely.
Pocket
Oh, what a gay time we shall have, and I do mean gay as in festive, not as in penetration of the bum. Oh, but dear me! I beg your pardon! You're holding your bags all this time! Pray, let me take them! [takes the bags to Pip's room] I'm quite ashamed!
Pip
Oh it's... quite alright. [remembers] Lord bless me! Why, you're the pale young man I saw at Ms. Havisham's house!
Pocket
Why, yes of course! You're the prowling little boy! Boy, what a smashing coincidence!
Pip
Perhaps, but perhaps not. Ms. Havisham is very generous indeed.
Pocket
That old biddy? Oh, I assure you, I have nothing to do with her anymore. She's absolutely mad!
Pip
Well, what do you mean?
Pocket
Well, don't you know about Ms. Havisham's melancholy past? Dear me, it's quite a story, and should be discussed over dinner. Come! [Pip removes his hat and they walk over to the table at one corner of the sitting room, by the windows. A cooked bird and two glasses wait for them] Right, time for a smashing meal and the story of Ms. Havisham.
Pip
Pocket, may I ask you a favor? I am desperately trying to become a gentleman! For the love of a certain girl. So, will you please tell me if I do something wrong at the table?
Pocket
You'll do fine, dear fellow, just fine. Now on to Ms. Havisham: She was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat. [Pip eats his food with his knife] And now I might mention, Pip, that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth.
Pip
[with knife by lips] Hoh, dear, I'm terribly sorry! [lowers the knife]
Pocket
[joyfully] Not at all, I'm sure. [looks at Pip] Anyway, Ms. Havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady, and soon a man came along, which gets me to the cruel part of the story, merely breaking off, Pip [who has placed his napkin in his glass], to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler.
Pip
[quickly retracts it] Sorry! Sorry!
Pocket
[joyfully] Not at all, I'm sure. [resumes] So this man pursued Ms. Havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her. She passionately loved him back. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dress was bought, the wedding guests were all invited, and finally the day came. But not the groom. [Pip farts] And I break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table!
Pip
Oh. Excuse me.
Pocket
Not at all, I'm sure. So the groom never showed. He simply wrote a letter, a letter that Ms. Havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding.
Pip
At half nine, the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house.
Pocket
But afterward she laid waste to the entire house, as you have seen it, and has never since looked upon the light of day. And the story ends, Pip, with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table.
Pip
Terribly sorry, Pocket.
Pocket
[joyfully] Not at all, I'm sure!
The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating

And so Pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman. He was schooled in several languages. He was taught fencing and marksmanship, and he was shown how to dance and eat box. And after it all, after WEEKS and weeks of intense schooling, Pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman. Proud of himself, Pip decided to pay Ms. Havisham a visit, to thank her for her generosity, and to see if he was indeed, now, good enough for Estella.
The Havisham Estate, exterior, then interior, at the dining room.
Pip
[enters the dining room] Good evening, Ms. Havisham. [she hasn't moved from her spot]
Ms. Havisham
Come closer, Pip. [he doffs his hat and approaches] My, you're quite the gentleman now, aren't you?
Pip
[cheerfully] Thanks to you.
Ms. Havisham
Perhaps. Estella's been off to school as well. [Pip walks to Ms. Havisham's side] She's become quite the lady. Would you like to see a picture of her? [shows him a portrait]
Pip
Oh, my! She is even prettier than before. [she is shown wearing a beautiful pink dress and a makeover]
Ms. Havisham
Ohoh, you love her, don't you, Pip?
Pip
[pensive] I don't know. I mean, I think about her every day.
Ms. Havisham
Do you know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it.
Pip
Righto.
Ms. Havisham
Love her, Pip. I developed her into what she is so that she might... be loved.
Pip
Yes, but... where will I find her?
Ms. Havisham
There's a dance at the Palace tomorrow night. Estella will be there. Go and seek her out. And love her. Love her!
Pip
Thank you, Ms. Havisham! For everything! [heads for the door] I'm the happiest boy in the land!
Ms. Havisham
And if she warms to you, love her; she tears your heart into pieces. And as you get older it will tear deeper. [whispers] Lover her.
The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating

Yes. Our young Pip had come a long way. From the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations. And now he was to finally see his beloved Estella again at a Grand Ball held by the King of England, Tony Blair. It was here that Pip would finally and formally ask Estella to be his girlfriend. And all would be right with the world.
The Grand Ballroom at the Palace, evening. Tony Blair and wife descend the Grand Staircase as dozens of couples dance before them. The camera then pans across the scene and stops on Estella. Pip comes in from the side
Pip
Hello, Estella.
Estella
Pip. [impressed] My goodness, how you've changed!
Pip
Yes. I've become a gentleman. May I? [signals an invitation to dance]
Estella
I suppose. [a waltz starts and all couples begin to dance.] So how is it that you've learned to dress and dance?
Pip
Well, I was sent to be schooled in London.
Estella
Iiii see, and you no longer live with the blacksmith?
Pip
Oh. I see Joe once in a while. But I don't have much in common with him anymore, now that I'm a gentleman and all.
Estella
Naturally. [overview of the Grand Ballroom]
Pip
[walks off to one side with Estella] It is wonderful to see you again, Estella.
Estella
Is it? Why? [they resume dancing]
Pip
Because I believe I'm in love with you.
Estella
Pip, you must know that I have no heart.
Pip
[confidently] I think you do.
Estella
Oh, I have a heart to be shot or stabbed in, no doubt, and if it cease to beat I should cease to be, but [sighs] you know what I mean. I have no softness there, no sympathy, sentiment.
Pip
I see past that, Estella. I see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind.
Older Boy
[walks up to the kids] Hey, Estella, let's get out of here.
Estella
Alright, Steve. Just one moment. [Steve walks off]
Pip
Who...? Who is that?
Estella
That is Steve. He is seventeen and has a car.
Pip
I see, and you... fancy this Steve fellow?
Estella
I should. He's my boyfriend.
Pip
[scared] Boyfriend??
Estella
What's the matter, Pip?!
Pip
I don't understand! I did everything right! I stopped being a poor commoner! I even blew off my lovin' Joe!
Estella
It's... it's... the way it goes sometimes, Pip. [Steve waits for her off to the side] He's... seventeen and has a car. I'm... I'm... very [pause] I'm [pause] leaving. [walks off with Steve.]
The Havisham Estate, outside, a stormy night. Pip reaches the Havisham estate and enters the front gates. He heads into the house, up the spiral staircase, and into the dining room.
Pip
Ms. Havisham! You have to talk to Estella! She's going out with a- [a surprised look comes over his face]
Ms. Havisham
Well well well, if it isn't Mr. Pip. [Estella and Steve are already there, sitting behind a small table at her side, next to each other, sharing a float between them]
Pip
Ms. Havisham! But um...
Ms. Havisham
Don't they make a handsome couple, Pip? [Steve reaches for Estella's right hand with his left] Look at the way he holds her hand.
Pip
But I don't understand. [doffs his hat] You sent me away to become a gentleman so that I could be with Estella.
Ms. Havisham
Things aren't always as they seem, Pip. [Pip looks defeated] Oh, what's the matter? Did she... break your heart?
Pip
[close-up] ...Well, I suppose that if you set out to break my heart, you did a very good job of it. Because it certainly does hurt.
Ms. Havisham
Yes. Tell me about the pain. [Estella looks distressed] Tell me about the crushing and the prickly things.
Pip
It's... a-as if...[winces] sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss [winces] squeezing it very tightly.
Ms. Havisham
Yes, and it is somewhat difficult to breathe.
Steve
Hey, wait a second. You mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom?
Ms. Havisham
[turns her head to look at Steve] Is your heart broken as well? Tell me all about it.
Pip
But why do you make your daughter hurt people?
Ms. Havisham
Wuh-hy? Well, that's simple. Because I need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my Genesis device. [Pip looks at her in horror] You see, my foolish child, I'm growing very old. But tonight I will fuse my soul into Estella's once and for all. And then I can go on breaking men's hearts for another generation.
Steve
What the hell??
Ms. Havisham
Estella, prepare yourself for the Genesis platform. [Estella draws away from Steve]
Steve
[holds on to Estella's left arm] Oh no, you don't! You're my girl! And I'm not lettin' you walk out on me! [Ms. Havisham flips opens a panel on the right arm of her chair and presses a red button. A contraption appears and wraps itself around Steve] What the?! [a cathode at the top of the head completes the contraption]
Ms. Havisham
And as for you, Pip, my robot monkeys should take care of you! [presses the button again and robot monkeys descend from the ceiling and clamor around Pip. He is startled and rushes out the door, down the stairs, out the front door, and out the front gates, only to stop and faint outside the gates]
The blacksmith's house, day. A shadow appears at Pip's door and falls on him. He awakens and looks at the source of the shadow
Joe
Pip? Pip, old chap? [appears blurry to Pip.]
Pip
[rises a bit] Joe?
Joe
That's right. You're safe and warm now.
Pocket
[stands next to Joe] Joe found you lying face down in the street, Mr. Pip, You were in such a state. You've been unconscious here for nearly three hours.
Pip
[sits up and says urgently] Ms. Havisham! She has all the men who have had their hearts broken by Estella trapped in her house! [laments] Oh, why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman?
Joe
Well, about that, Pip: There's another person who wants to see you. [the convict Pip had set free earlier returns, but he's nicely dressed now, in three-piece suit and gloves]
Ex-Convict
Allo, Pip. You remember me? [Pip cowers and remembers...]
Ex-Convict
[threatening him back at the graveyard when they first met] I'll rip off your arms and shove 'em up your arse!
Pip
Why, you're the escaped convict I helped a long time ago.
Ex-Convict
Yes. After you helped me I moved to Wales and made somethin' o' myself. If it weren't for you, I'd have never become a millionaire.
Joe
'E's the one that sent you to London, Pip! 'E's the one who sent you off to be a gentleman!
Pip
You? But why?
Ex-Convict
Because back then you treated me like any other person. You're weren't a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man.
Pip
Oh, dear. All this time I thought it was Ms. Havisham. She totally let me believe it. [Pocket approaches]
Pocket
I tried to tell you, Pip. She's a vengeful, spiteful woman, who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex.
Pip
Well, I've certainly learned a lot. That being a gentleman doesn't mean learning to dance, or proper table manners. It means being a gentle man. Gentle to everyone.
Pocket
Righto. Pip. Righto.
Pip
And now I suppose there's only one thing left to do.
Joe
What's that, Pip.
Pip
If Ms. Havisham is determined to do this to others, let's go KICK HER ARSE!
Joe
Yeah! [Pocket raises his hands, Joe and the convict pump their fists]
The South Park Classics study. The British Person resumes narrating

And now we come to the final act of the Dickens classic tale, in which the stage is set for an epic showdown. Ms. Havisham's robot monkeys prove a formidable foe, but Pip is not about to let Estella's soul be forever consumed by the Genesis device. And now the thrilling conclusion of Great Expectations!
The Havisham Estate, outside, a stormy night. In the dining room Ms. Havisham prepares Estella for the Genesis device
Ms. Havisham
Are you ready, Estella? Are you ready to complete the cycle?
Estella
Yes, Mother. [Ms. Havisham straps herself into her seat, and the main door fly open. In come Joe and Pocket with swords, the ex-convict with a pistol, and Pip with a filled bag]
Pip
Not so fast, you ugly ancient bitch.
Estella
Pip? [Ms. Havisham presses the red button once again.and her chair floats forward]
Joe
[wielding his sward] Your manhating days are over, Ms. Havisham!
Ms. Havisham
Quite the contrary, blacksmith. My revenge on the male race is only about to begin.
Pocket
Dear God, Pip, look! [points to a long contraption containing men and boys hanging upside down from their ankles. Bowls wait underneath them to receive their tears.]
Steve
[second from left] Estella, help me! I'm your boyfriend!
Boy
[third from right] So am I.
Man
[left of center] And me.
Man In Middle
We were all Estella's boyfriends at one time or another. Now we're doomed.
Ms. Havisham
Yes. Cry away, males. [returns to her original position] Once your tears have collected into the Genesis device, the fusion of Estella and me will be complete.
Pip
You won't get away with this!
Ms. Havisham
Won't I? [presses the red button, and robot monkeys again descend from the ceiling and come at the guests. Joe and the others use their weapons to fend off the attacks.] Let the transformation begin. [the cables have been activated]
Joe
[disables a robot monkey by slicing its leg off] Pip, she started the device! [the men on the torture device bawl]
Pip
[approaches among the robot monkey corpses] Pocket! Get over there, and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying!
Pocket
Righto, Pip. [they do their tasks]
Ms. Havisham
[activates the device full throttle] It begins.
Pip
[approaches Estella] Come, Estella! You can't want to be part of this.
Estella
It is... what I was raised for. [a robot monkey jumps at the ex-convict, and the ex-convict shoots at it and kills it off]
Robot Monkey
AAAAAAA!!!
Pocket
Hello, gentlemen. Oh, whatever you do, please do not cry. Havisham's device fuels itself on your tears, I'm afraid.
Man
How are we not to cry. Our hearts have been broken, our lives ruined, and now we are set to die!
Pocket
Yes, but just think about... panda bears! [the hanging males just look at him] Oh, they're so cuddly and sweet, panda bears are. [grabs his own nose] What silly little noses they have!
Man
[third from left] Panda bears make me sad. They're almost extinct.
Pocket
[quickly waves the thought away with both hands] Oh, right, right, let's not think about panda bears, then. Let's think about ...swimming! Oh, what jolly fun swimming is, with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive. [the males just look at him]
Ms. Havisham
...Yes...
Ex-Convict
[quickly approaches] Get out of that chair, you old cow! [points a gun at her, and she spits a green fluid into his face. A few moments later he turns away and his face has been eaten away by the fluid, revealing bones and teeth.. He babbles on a bit, then drops down dead.]
Pip
[still before Estella] Estella! Listen to me! You are a wonderful girl, with a kind heart.
Estella
I told you, Pip. I have no heart.
Pip
But you do! And I shall prove it to you once and for all! [reaches into his bag. Joe is still fending off the robot monkeys. Pip pulls out a bunny] Look at this adorable little bunny.
Estella
[flatly] Oh my. 'E's very cute.
Pip
You see that? A heartless person wouldn't care at all about this bunny. They'd just as soon break its neck. [she reaches out to grab it, then breaks its neck with nary a flinch] ...Oh. But look at this bunny. [pulls out another bunny from the bag and presents it to her] There. You see that? You have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies. [she reaches out to grab it, then breaks its neck. Pip gets worried] ...Right.
Pocket
[still diverting the guys on the rack] Oh what fun it is to collect stamps! Lick the backs, put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors.
Man
[left of center] My father died in a stamp-collecting accident.
Pocket
Right, let's not talk about stamp-collecting, then. Let's talk about... [thinks a bit]
Man In Middle
Ice-skating!
Pocket
Oh what fun ice-skating is! [moves around as if ice-skating] Who can catch me? Who can catch the ice-skating king? That's me.
Joe
[now covered in robot monkeys] Oy can't figh' 'em off no moh!
Pip
Nine. Nine baby bunnies. A person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies. So you do have too big a heart to- [crrrack. Estella has killed another bunny] Ten baby bunnies!
Joe
[still fighting the robot monkeys] ...There's too many of them! [the males on the rack begin to cry]
Pocket
Please, sirs, you must not cry!
Man
[left of center] We can't help it! You're bawlin' us to tears! [lights under the rack flick on one by one, and the sequence leads to a computer, and then to the Genesis device]
Pocket
Philip, it's too late!!
Pip
Twenty-six baby bunnies
Estella
I don't want to. I don't see the point in this.
Pip
What?
Estella
I don't want to kill any more of them.
Pip
There! You see?! You do have a heart!
Estella
You think so? Let me see it [referring to the bunny] Maybe I can kill it.
Pip
[quickly hides the bunny] No no, I'm sure of it. You have a heart! You've bought your own life! Come with me now! [she looks back at him]
Ms. Havisham
Yessss! [electricity crackles and then moves over to Estella's part of the Genesis device. Estella looks up at Ms. Havisham, then stretches her hand out to Pip. Pip takes her hand and quickly takes her away from the device. Ms. Havisham looks over] Noooo! [her chair bursts into flames and she screams horribly, twisting here and there]
Pocket
Ooooo, top smart, Pip! [Ms. Havisham's body quickly turns to ashes]
Joe
You did it, Pip! [the last of the robot monkeys falls away]
The Havisham Estate, outside, a stormy night. Joe, Pip, Pocket, the nine males, and Estella leave the house as flames spread from the dining room to other rooms and onto the yard. The party moves towards the gate, then turns back to watch the burning house
Joe
Well, I guess Old Ms. Havisham won't be takin' any revenge on any more blokes, ey?
Estella
Yes. her poor miserable life is finally over.
Pip
You're released from her now, Estella! Now we can begin our life together!
Estella
Yes! Yes, my small-testicled love! [she and Pip embrace]
Pocket
Oh, I'm so glad everything has worked out. [Pip and Estella break the embrace] Where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then, Pip?

And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Pocket, who died of hepatitis B. [closes the book and rests it on his laps] So ends Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. We hope you now have a deeper appreciation for Pip, and indeed, [holds up the book] all masterpieces of literature like this one. [rests it again] Until next time, I'm a British person. Good night.
End of Pip

Fat Camp
South Park Elementary, day, Ms. Choksondik's classroom. Ms. Choksondik enters and stands before the blackboard.
Ms. Choksondik
Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism.
Class
Yeah! [There are new seating arrangements to note: Wendy now sits to Stan's left. Timmy sits in the back of the class. Pip sits behind Kenny. Two students not seen before join the class]
Bebe, New Kid
Woohoo.
Ms. Choksondik
[walks off] Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee. [return with a large dolly stacked with manatee corpses. Stan and Kyle glance at each other] Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea.
Wendy
Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?
Ms. Choksondik
They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them. [pushes the dolly towards the class and hands the manatees out] Now, we don't have quite enough [one goes to Butters] manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. [Stan and Annie get manatees]
Butters
Hey! Ours is still alive!
Ms. Choksondik
[walks up and looks] Oh, hold on. [walks away. The manatee raises its head. Ms. Choksondik returns with a brick and brings it down hard on the manatee's head twice, killing it and exposing its brain. Butters is stunned. Ms. Choksondik returns to the front of the class] Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen.
Stan
[holding his knife] I can't do it, dude.
Kyle
Aw, don't be such a baby! [takes the knife, blinks, then offers it to Kenny] You do it, Kenny.
Kenny
(Nuh uh!)
Kyle
Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
Kenny
(FIVE BUCKS???) [grabs the knife and starts cutting away]
Stan
Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
The Cartman house, living room. Cartman and his mom watch TV. Cartman laughs. Terrance and Phillip are on. They are dressed as detectives They look at a corpse with a dagger stabbed into the chest
Phillip
Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso.
Terrance
I don't see anything.
Phillip
Look closer. [Terrance looks closer] Closer. [Terrance bends down further. Phillip holds Terrance's head down] Hunh-nh.
Terrance
I still don't see anything, Phillip.
Phillip
Waitwait. Hunh.
Cartman
I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
Phillip
[grunts softly] Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here. [grunts long, farts, and cackles. The camera pulls back to reveal Terrance standing on a stool. Phillip looks to see Terrance ready to fart on him. Terrance lets loose...] Ah! [...and Phillip is blown into a nearby wall, then falls on his side] Af!
Terrance
AAHahahahahahaaa!
Cartman
Whoa! That totally surprised me! [his mom looks at him] I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
Liane
Eh yes, sweetie.
Cartman
[sweetly] Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? [grins]
Liane
Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself? [his grin vanishes] Mommy's [looks away] expecting [looks back] some company.
Cartman
God, I have to everything around here!
The Cartman house, kitchen. Cartman grabs a stool and walks over to the kitchen counter with it. He starts singing softly as he prepares his dish. He pulls out some Pop Toasties and puts them in a toaster, gets some powdered chocolate milk and a stick of butter, rolls the butter in the powdered milk, gets the Pop Toasties, and places the chocolate-covered butter between the two Pop Toasties. He squeezes down for good measure and makes his way out of the kitchen.
The Cartman house, living room. Cartman enters singing to himself
Cartman
I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- [blinks and looks up. In the living room now with his mom are Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Dr. Doctor.] What the hell's going on?
Liane
Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a "talk" with you.
Mr. Mackey
Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?
Cartman
[incredulous] What?!
Dr. Doctor
We believe that you might have a problem.
Cartman
You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
Mr. Garrison
It's called intervention, Eric.
Liane
Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
Cartman
Fat camp?
Dr. Doctor
Yes, fat camp.
Cartman
Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this, [grabs his creation and drops the plate on the floor] but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
Mr. Mackey
Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.
Cartman
[pleading] Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!
Liane
Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. [Cartman is stunned. A piece of Pop Toasties falls on the floor]
South Park Elementary, day, Ms. Choksondik's class. The manatees have been dissected in various places, and body parts are all over the desks and floor. A drawing of the manatee and its organs is now on the blackboard.
Ms. Choksondik
And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-
Principal Victoria
[opens the door and peeks in] Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?
Ms. Choksondik
[puts down the pointer and goes towards the door] Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back. [opens the door and exits.]
Kyle
[working on his manatee] Aw, dude, check this out. [pulls out the spleen with some scissors]
Stan
[off-screen] That's so gross.
Kyle
Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
Kenny
(I'm not eatin' that!)
Kyle
I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
Stan
I'll throw in five.
South Park Elementary, day, hallway. Principal Victoria talks to Ms. Choksondik there.
Principal Victoria
And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.
Ms. Choksondik
Oh dear.
South Park Elementary, day, Ms. Choksondik's class. Some desks have been moved aside and the kids continue contributing to the kitty...
Butters
I'll throw in a dollar!
Bebe
I've got three.
Kyle
Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
Stan
[off-screen, enticing] forty-one bucks. [Kenny jumps up and starts eating it. The others groan and moan] Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!
Ms. Choksondik
[returns to the front of the class] Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. [the kids blink with surprise]
A wooded area, day. A camp is shown in some hills. It is called "Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center." The Cartman station wagon drives into the camp
Liane
...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want. [Cartman has been looking away all this time. She looks at him] Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. [the station wagon pulls up to the Hopeful Hills REGISTRATION building]
Male Counselor
Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman.
Liane
Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.
Male Counselor
Oh, we'll change that. [bends down next to the passenger window] Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?
Cartman
Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?
Rick
I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get yo oriented. [stands up and Cartman exits the car] I'll take care of him from here, ma'am.
Liane
Oh. [bows and opens her arms to hug Cartman] Well, goodbye, sweetie.
Cartman
[darkly] Don't touch me! [moves away a bit]
Rick
Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!
Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, later. A group of kids, all of them fat, stand in a circle and look at each other.
Brunette
[to Cartman's right] Have you got any candy?
Cartman
No.
Taller Bo
[to Cartman's left] My mom says I ain't to eat no candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight.
Rick
[walks up to the group enthusiastically] Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is [jumps] fun, right gang?
Taller Boy
Right.
Rick
Wait a second. [holds his right hand to his ear] Do you kids hear something? [drops his hand] I could've swore that-
Pink Monster
Raaarrrr!!! [a woman in costume]
Rick
Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!
Pink Monster
I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow! [starts hopping around]
Rick
Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise! [holds up an EXERCISE paddle, strikes the monster on the head with it, and tosses it away] And... Proper Diet. [does the same with a PROPER DIET paddle]
Pink Monster
Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me. [falls over on her side]
Rick
I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?
Taller Boy
Yeah! [Cartman glares at him]
Rick
Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan, [she pops out of the costume] who's another weight counselor! [she jumps out in front of the costume and exults]
Taller Boy
Heh! It was a lady in a costume!
Cartman
[miffed] Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
South Park Elementary, day, playground. Stan and Pip stand by Kenny, who's groaning in pain and holding his stomach.
Kyle
[walks up with Butters] What's the matter?
Stan
Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. [Clyde and Token come in from the right, Wendy and Bebe come in from the left. Stan comforts Kenny.]
Kyle
Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. [Stan jumps back as Kenny starts vomiting the spleen up. Stan and Kyle watch in shock]
Kids
Eewww.
Stan
Well, at least you got it out of your system.
Kyle
Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen! [Butters looks at him] How much, Kenny?
Kenny
(WHAT?!)
Kyle
I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
Butters
Huh-I'm in for five!
Stan
Oh, you guys!
Clyde
I've got three.
Token
Six!
Butters
Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. [Kenny takes it and opens it up, then bends to scoop the vomit up into the thermos]
Kyle
That's 19 bucks, Kenny! [more kids gather]
Kenny
(Ungh.) [goes ahead and eats his vomit]
Kids around Kenny
AAAAA!
Kids around Timmy
Waugh.
Kyle
Kick ass, dude!
Stan
You know, dude, there might be something to this.
Kyle
Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, later. The counselors come up over a hill and down the other side jogging. They stop
Rick
Doing great kids! Come on! [they resume jogging and the fat kids lumber to the top of the hill panting behind them. Cartman stops and droops]
Cartman
[resumes jogging] This... is... bullcrap!
Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, mess hall, after dinner. Rick is talking to the kids
Rick
Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?
Cartman
[in withdrawal] I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
Susan
[cheerfully arrives with a loaded plate] I hope you all left room for dessert. Soybean pudding for everybody! [serves a plate of the stuff to everyone there, starting with Cartman's table]
Brunet Boy
[to Cartman's left] Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?
Cartman
[shoves his plate to the boy] Take it! I can't eat this crap!
Blonde Girl
[to Cartman's right] Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die.
Cartman
[to the girl] Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
Brunet Boy
I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?
Cartman
Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!
Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, night. Cartman sneaks out and creeps along the side of the campers' cabin
Cartman
Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. [sees the entrance and races for it. He exits and races through the meadow until he reaches a road.] We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run? [an ice cream truck approaches him] An ice cream truck! Hey wait! [races up to the truck. The driver exits the cab] Boy, am I glad to see you!
Driver
Can I interest you in some ice cream?
Cartman
You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
Driver
[goes to the back of the truck, opens the doors, and pulls out one pop.] Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? [points to the inside of the truck. Cartman looks]
Cartman
Hunh? [is lifted up] Uuh! [and tossed into the truck. The doors are closed behind him, and he looks up. Before him sit four other kids who have tried to escape]
Boy 1
[on bench at left]They tricked us again, huh?
Cartman
[stands up] Aw, God-damnit! [turns] LET ME OUT OF HMYA! [pounds on the back doors]
Driver
Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. [drives into camp]
Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, moments later. The campers' cabin door is opened and the five escapees return to their bunks
Boy 1
They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us.
Taller Boy
Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy. [Rick and Susan pop into the campers' cabin.]
Rick
Hey kids!
Susan
Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.
Rick
Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave.
Susan
[bends forward sweetly a bit and cocks her head to the left] There is no escape.
Rick
So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT
Eric
[pissed off] Aw, damnit!
South Park, the Cartman house. Butters and Timmy have replaced Cartman in the boy's group for now, and they stand in front of the Broflovski parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, Sharon March, Principal Victoria, and Dr. Doctor. They argue amongst themselves.
Gerald
That's what being young is all about.
Mr. Garrison
[at the same time] But that's not the question.
Liane
Thanks for coming, everybody.
Mr. Mackey
Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weight-management camp?
Stan
We knew he wouldn't make it.
Liane
Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. [steps to one side as Cartman enters]
New Cartman
Hey, dudes!
Kyle
Whoa! [the others look stunned]
Stan
I don't believe it.
Liane
Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. [everyone gathers round Cartman]
Mr. Mackey
Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!
Principal Victoria
Congratulations. How do you feel?
New Cartman
I feel awesome!
Kyle
What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
New Cartman
You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm [leans a bit to eye Kyle's belly] a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy! [stands erect] Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle.
Liane
I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
Cartman
Memememeee! [the group heads for the kitchen while Stan and Kyle stay behind]
Kyle
Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
Stan
Did you like the old one?
Kyle
Good point.
Jesus and Pals
Announcer
And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South Park Public Access.
Jesus
[with the new Cartman] Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength.
New Cartman
No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works.
Jesus
A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman! [the studio audience applauds] Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? [Kenny enters with Stan, Kyle, and a dog. Music begins as a spotlight falls on Kenny. The dog turns his ass to Kenny and craps. A musical riff plays as Kenny picks the crap up and the audience groans with disgust. Some of them cover their eyes. Kenny lifts the crap dramatically into the air a wailing female joins the music. Another riff plays as Kenny swallows the crap. A small pedestal appears under him and pushes him up and around. The audience groans some more, Kenny finishes off the crap, and the audience beings to cheer. The new Cartman is pissed]
New Cartman
God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!
Jesus
[hesitant] Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny.
Kenny
[gracious] (Sure!)
Man 1
Do it again!
Man 2
Do it again!
Man 3
Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!
New Cartman
This is ridiculous! [picks at his eye]
Jesus
So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?
Stan
We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
Jesus
I can't say I approve of this, my children.
Kyle
[he and Stan look at Jesus for a moment] Huh? Why not?
Jesus
Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
Man 4
I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit.
Man 5
Yeah!
Man 6
Yeah! Go for it!
Stan
[to Kyle] What's a prostitute?
Kyle
I don't know.
South Park Elementary, day, cafeteria. The kids mill around and eat during lunchtime. In line for their lunches are Craig, Tweek, Butters, and a few others. In the kitchen Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive for their lunches.
Chef
[behind the sneeze guard, as usual] Hello there, children!
Stan, Kyle, Kenny
Hey, Chef:
Stan
Chef, what's a prostitute?
Chef
[ponders, then displeased] Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! "Chef, what's the clitoris?" "What's a lesbian, Chef?" "How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?" [the boys blink. Stan and Kyle look at each other] For once, can't you just come in here and say, "Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"!
Stan
Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?
Chef
[pleased] It sure is! Thank you.
Stan
Chef, what's a prostitute?
Chef
Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
New Cartman
[joins the other boys] Lunchtime! I'm starved!
Chef
Oh my God. Eric?
New Cartman
That's me.
Stan
Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
Chef
Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
Stan
Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
Kenny
(Yeah. Am I?)
Chef
Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.
Kyle
Why?
Chef
Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.
Stan
Like what?
Chef
Like keeping you company. Understand?
Stan
No.
Chef
You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. [begins singing]
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
[the new Cartman looks at the other boys as he starts sneaking away. They don't notice him. Other kids, Annie, Token, Clyde, Butters, and Bebe, enter the kitchen]
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
[Principal Victoria arrives and listens]
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor.

James Taylor
[enters next to Chef playing a guitar]
A prostitute is like any other woman
They all trade somethin' for sex and they do it well.
[the new Cartman goes into the supply room and starts packing donuts into his backpack]

Chef
And that's why I say-

Chef and James Taylor
Prostitutes! Prostitutes! They-

Chef
Oohhhh [they stop when they see Principal Victoria, who has crossed her arms in anger] ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here! [James leaves, but Principal Victoria is not satisfied.] ...These children tricked me!
Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, that night. After being tucked int bed, the new Cartman sneaks out and rides a bike towards the Center, hides the bike near the entrance, and approaches the gate
New Cartman
[a shadow falls on him] Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy.
Cartman
Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
New Cartman
Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
Cartman
Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
New Cartman
Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
Cartman
What?!
New Cartman
I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!
Cartman
Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
New Cartman
Twenty.
Cartman
[soft gasp] Suck my balls, 20!
New Cartman
Fine! Then I shall bid you good day! [turns aside to get his bike]
Cartman
Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! [the new Cartman looks trapped]
The University of Colorado, dorm room. Several students are reading their books while clothes is strewn all over the place
Student 1
[bursts through the door] You guys! You have to check this tape out!
Student 2
[on the sofa] Ey, we're trying to study. Finals are tomorrow.
Student 1
No, dude, check this out! It's a video: this kid, he does all kinds of crazy stuff. [pops the video into the VCR and turns on the TV] Check it out! He jumped into a Porto-Potty at a construction site and stayed there for four days! [the screen shows Kenny standing in a pool of poo under the toilet and looking at the camera]
Other Students
Whoa! [the screen shows a construction worker heading for the Porto-Potty. He enters and sits on the toilet, and a long log of poo descends from his nether regions]
Kenny
[the poo lands square on his face] (Ow.)
Student 1
Oh, gro-hoss
Student 3
Sick!
Student 2
That's awesome! [rushes out to the hall and hollers] Hey guys! Check this out!
The Krazy Kenny Show, live
Announcer
[graphics come up animated, with letters exploding behind the show's logo] Get ready for the Krrrrrrazy Kenny Show! [four spotlights roam the stage] And now here's your host, the kid who will do anything to himself for money, Krrrra—a--a-a-azy Kenny! [Kenny appears and goes to the center of the stage, The spotlights converge on him as music reaches climax] Kenny, through the past weeks we've seen you eat mice, pretend to kill newborn babies to shock their mothers and ...wash your hair with battery acid. The question in all our minds is, who-haht are you gonna do next? [the audience cheers]
Kenny
(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)
Announcer
Whoa-ho ho! You heard him, folks! Kenny is going to give a sensual full-body massage to his own grandfather!
Man 1
Oho! Yeah!
Man 2
Woohoo!
Fanfare as the stage rotates to reveal Kenny's grandfather relaxing on a heart-shaped bed. Kenny opens up a bottle of massage oil and begins massaging him
Audience
Awww! Awgh!
Stan
Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
New Cartman
This is so juvenile. [bites a licorice stick. He has a box of donuts on his lap, and he and Kyle have licorice sticks]
Kyle
Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? [takes a donut]
Stan
Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
New Cartman
Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home?
Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, next night. Rick is in the campers' cabin
Rick
Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet. [opens the door, exits, and closes the door]
Susan
[waiting] All beddy-byes for the night, are they?
Rick
I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight.
Susan
We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it!
Rick
They'll do it.
Susan
They'll do it!! [the counselors leave. Inside the cabin Cartman looks out the window, watching them leave]
Cartman
[turns around] Alright, they're gone! [walks to his bed and pulls out a suitcase from underneath] The Cartman store is open! [the other kids leave their bunks and head for Cartman]
Blonde Girl
[first in line, hands him some money] Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please.
Cartman
[quickly as he hands the goods over] Two donuts and a pack of licorice. [she walks away,and a big, tall boy is next] Well, Tony, the usual? [Tony, with squinty eyes, blinks and Cartman gives him the usual. Tony walks away. Another boy walks up, crying] Why are you crying, Chad?
Chad
[sobbing] 'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this. [sobs some more. Cartman moves away a bit] All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself. [breaks down]
Cartman
[comforts Chad] Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
Chad
[wipes away his tears] I'd, I do?
Cartman
Yes. [dangles a chocolate in front of him] A chocolate friend. [Chad begins to howl] Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are. [opens the wrapper to expose the aroma and tempts him] Look at how yummy and sweet he is. [Chad, still sobbing, takes the candy bar and starts eating. Cartman bides his time] ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars. [Chad hands him the money and finishes the candy bar. Cartman just watches] ...There you go.
A Krazy Kenny Show promo
Announcer
This week on Pay Per View [a yellow starburst appears with "PAY PER VIEW" on it, then another starburst with Kenny standing behind Ms. Crabtree], Krazy Kenny will crawl up into a woman's uterus and [a shot of Kenny inside the uterus] stay there for six hours. Don't miss this once-in-a-lifetime event. Order now!
The big city, day. City noise is heard. Next shot is in a studio, with Howard Stern hosting, and three guests. On the walls are posters, one of which is of Elton John. Two loves dolls are in the background, and the Antonio Banderas one is behind Stern
Howard Stern
Alright, so we're back talkin' to three competing celebrities: Tom Green, Johnny Knoxville from MTV's Jackass and Krazy Kenny.
Tom Green
Hey, Howard.
Howard Stern
Krazy Kenny is here to promote his Pay-Per-View special this week, where he will crawl up into a bus driver's uterus and stay there for six hours.
Johnny Knoxville
[stammering] Wow!
Howard Stern
Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now.
Tom Green
I'm in.
Johnny Knoxville
Me too.
Kenny
(And me!)
Howard Stern
Oh.
Tom Green
Fine! I'll do it for 40!
Johnny Knoxville
30.
Tom Green
[points at Johnny] 20!
Kenny
(...Ten bucks!)
Howard Stern
Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks.
Tom Green
Damnit. I'm out.
Johnny Knoxville
Me too. I guess he is the biggest whore.
Howard Stern
Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras?
Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, day. Exercise...
Rick
And we're gonna reach for the sky... [has arms high above his head]
Campers
[follow through] Woo-aagh.
Rick..
And down to the ground. [touches the ground with his fingertips]
Campers
[follow through] Woo-ugh.
Rick
And up to the sky... [arms high above his head]
Campers
[follow through] Woo-aagh. [Cartman and the camper to his right perform a quick transaction - Cartman hands him a pastry for a few bucks.]
Rick..
And down to the ground. [touches the ground with his fingertips]
Campers
[follow through] Woo-ugh. [a couple enters the yard with their son, the taller camper Cartman got annoyed with early on. Susan catches up]
Susan
Please, Mr. Sanders. [Rick rises quickly]
Mr. Sanders
No! I have had it!
Rick
What's happening?
Susan
Horace's parents want to take him home.
Rick
Oh! But he's not ready yet.
Mr. Sanders
Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics!
Rick
They can lose the weight if they try.
Mr. Sanders
Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner! [a shot of the campers] Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that most fat people are just genetically fat!
Susan
Please, sir, if you give us one more week,...
Mr. Sanders
Your time is up!
Mrs. Sanders
Yeah, your time is up!
Mr. Sanders
And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim their kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time!
Horace
But, Dad, I...
Mr. Sanders
What?! [Horace looks at Cartman, who look back concerned]
Horace
...Nothin'. [he and his parents turn right and walk away]
Susan
We're in trouble, Rick.
South Park, day. At the television studio preparations are made for Kenny's test of endurance. Tweek, Token, Clyde, Butters, and Kyle (with hammer) are onstage. The sounds of sawing and hammering fill the air. Ms. Crabtree is prepped for the test, with her legs spread open and the genital area blocked off by small curtains.
Kyle
Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?
Ms. Crabtree
HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
Kyle
Six hours.
Ms. Crabtree
HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!
Kyle
Great.
Stan
[enters and runs to the stage] You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
Kyle
For what?
Stan
For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
Butters
Who-what's a hummer??
Stan
I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
Kyle
Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
Stan
I know! [Kyle gets an idea. He and Stan descend the steps to talk to the new Cartman, who stands nearby]
Kyle
[sits next to the new Cartman. Stan sits by Kyle's other side] He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
New Cartman
You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame. [Kyle looks at him with suspicious anger]
Kyle
...Alright, that does it! [rises and backs up a bit] This has been bothering the hell out of me! [reaches for the new Cartman's cap and pulls it off, revealing a puffy head of hair. Stan registers shock] I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
New Cartman
Uh oh.
The Krazy Kenny Show. The big moment arrives
Announcer
Well, we've seen him do just about every disgusting thing in the book, and today live on pay-per-view, Krazy Kenny is going to crawl into a woman's uterus for six hours! [the audience jumps and applauds] Well, Ms. Crabtree, your cervix has been dilated, your womb equipped with oxygen- How do you feel?
Ms. Crabtree
I feel great! I haven't had this much attention paid to my coot since I was 16!
Audience
[jumping, cheering] Hooray!
Announcer
Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the-
The Krazy Kenny Show, backstage. Kyle and Stan get the new Cartman, now the new Kenny, ready, dressing him like Kenny.
Kyle
Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.
New Kenny
[pulls the hood off his face] No way! I'm not doing this!
Kyle
Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!
New Kenny
But this isn't fair!
Stan
[walks up and puts the hood back on the new Kenny] Deal, druggie!
New Kenny
(But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there!)
The Krazy Kenny Show, later
Announcer
And here he is, Kenny McCormick! [Kenny enters, waves to the audience as it cheers, and walks towards Ms. Crabtree. Kenny parts the little curtains and the audience quiets down. The audience reacts as Kenny climbs into the uterus] We can watch him on the video monitors. How are you doin' in there, Kenny? [four monitors frame the stage prop behind Ms. Crabtree. Above her is a digital timer. Inside the womb, Kenny holds his right thumb up]
Mrs. McCormick
That's my boy! [Stuart smiles]
Hopeful Hills Children's Weight Management Center, next day. The parents have come for their campers. All the parents are fat, too.
Rick
Good-bye, Chad.
Chad's Dad
We'll be wanting our refund, naturally.
Rick
Naturally.
Susan
Good-bye, Alice.
Alice
Good-bye. Thank you.
Rick
Oh, don't thank us. We failed you.
Cartman
[off to one side] ...65, 66, 67... [counting the dollars he's collected during his stay]
Chad
[at the back door of the car, turns around] Wait a second! This isn't right! [other campers and their parents stop] It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food!
Cartman
[through gritted teeth] Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!
Horace
No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating.
Other campers
Yeah.
Horace
I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more.
Girl
Me neither.
Other campers
Yeah. [newly overjoyed, Rick and Susan grin and look at each other]
Horace
If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat.
Rick
Well, it's alright with me. Parents?
Mr. Sanders
Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all done you can teach me a thing or two, huh son? [rubs his son's hair; Horace looks up and grins at him]
Cartman
You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! [grins hopefully]
Susan
Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore.
Campers
Yeah.
Cartman
What?!
Rick
Bubbye. [turns around and walks into the registration building with Susan. The rest of the campers follow them in.]
Cartman
Well, screw you, fatasses! [begins sobbing, and pulls out a donut from his pocket. He eats at it between sobs.]
The Krazy Kenny Show, stage. The countdown continues...
Audience
Four, three, two, one!
Announcer
He did it! Come on out, Kenny! [nothing happens] You made it six hours, Kenny. Come on out of there. [nothing] Hmmm. Uh, Ms. Crabtree, maybe you could give him a little push. [Ms. Crabtree breathes in and pushes down. The new Kenny comes out of the uterus and slides down the steps of the stage]
Audience
OOOOHHHHHH!
Dr. Doctor
He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.
Ms. Crabtree
I told you I was a tight virgin flower.
Stan
[pointing] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
Kyle
Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
Announcer
Well, he gave his life for our amusement. One little boy who dared to be different. Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick. [Ms. Crabtree pushes down and another boy, wearing glasses, descends] Who was that?
End of Fat Camp

The Wacky Molestation Adventure
South Park, day, Kyle's house. Kyle is playing football with Ike on the front lawn. The football rests in front of Ike
Kyle
Come on. Throw the football, Ike.
Ike
[picks up the football] No on dahdo. [the football weighs him down and he sinks into the snow. Kyle rushes forward]
Stan
[rushes up with Cartman and Kenny] Dude! [Kyle looks] You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
Kyle
Hepatitis B?
Cartman
No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
Kyle
...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
Stan
We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
Kyle
[withdraws] Hold on. I'll be right back. [turns and runs into the house]
Kyle's house, living room. On the sofa Gerald reads a newspaper, Sheila reads a book. Kyle rushes up to them
Kyle
Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
Sheila
No, Kyle.
Kyle
But all the guys are going!
Sheila
Kyle, you're not old enough, and those concerts are dangerous and vile.
Kyle
But Mom, I-
Gerald
The answer is no, Kyle!
Kyle
Ugh! [turns right and walks out]
Kyle's house, front lawn. Kyle rejoins the boys
Kyle
My parents said I can't go.
Stan
[blinks at Cartman, who blinks back] Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
Cartman
Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Kyle
[looks down] Ah. Oh, now I already told them.
Cartman
Well, I guess you're screwed, then. [walks away with the other two]
Kyle
No! It's alright! Just give me some time to work on them. I'll see you guys later. [turns and runs back into the house. Ike finally throws the football off and looks out from the snow]
Kyle's house, living room. Kyle tries to persuade his parents
Kyle
...But what if I do a bunch of chores around the house? Come on, you're being unfair!
Sheila
Alright. Fine, Kyle, you can go to the Raging Pussies concert if you clean out the garage, shovel the driveway and bring democracy to Cuba!
Kyle
What's Cuba?
Gerald
A communist country run by a dictator named Fidel Castro.
Kyle
And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
Sheila
The whole thing.
Kyle
Hoh, geez. [walks away]
Kyle's house, his bedroom, night. He's at his desk writing a letter. He's done his other chores
Kyle
Dear Mr. Castro: [thinks] I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
Centro Nacional de Cuba. Castro, flanked by an armed guard on each side, is at his desk reading Kyle's letter
Kyle
And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
[Castro sees a drawing of a sad Kyle holding a flower, which fades to a sad Kyle writing his letter]
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
[Kyle finishes a drawing of a sad rainbow coalition atop a world globe]
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
[Castro see a drawing of a sad Kyle inside a small house]
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
[A picture of Kyle replaces his self-portrait on the paper]
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin'
[Kyle finishes one last drawing of himself, which Castro sees last]
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.

Castro
¡¡Llamen a todos junto!!
Kyle's house, living room, next day. He and his parents watch TV and a news brief comes on. Kyle smiles, his parents are stunned
Reporter
Once again, this does mark the end of Communism in Cuba. Cuban dictator Fidel Castro claims he was finally convinced by a young boy's letter. [A shot of Kyle behind a wooden fence comes up] Now the country is again open to American tourism. [shot of Sheila and Gerald stunned] Plans can finally resume for Knott's Berry Farm Cuba. [Sheila and Gerald look at each other]
Kyle
[exults] I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
Sheila
No you can't!
Kyle
[wounded, turns] What??
Gerald
Kyle, your mother and I don't want you going to the Raging Pussies concert! We gave you a chore that we thought was impossible. You weren't supposed to actually do it.
Kyle
But I did! Ah, I brought democracy to Cuba!
Sheila
We know, Kyle, but we just don't want you going to their concert.
Kyle
But that's not fair! You lied to me!
Gerald
Kyle, perhaps we handled this wrong, buh- but you need to understand that we don't want-
Kyle
What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
Gerald
Because we're your parents!
Kyle
Well I wish I didn't have any parents! [walks to the front door, opens it, and exits]
Sheila
Kyle!
Kenny's house, front steps. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit on the steps as Kenny plays on the lawn with a fire truck
Kyle
It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
Stan
Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
Kyle
They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
Cartman
[smoothly] Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
Kyle
How?!
Cartman
Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
Stan
The police?
Cartman
Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
Kyle
What's that?
Cartman
I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
Kyle
[awed] Wow! Three months without parents!
Kenny
(Wow, that is awesome!)
Stan
But what do the police do to them?
Kyle
Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
Cartman
You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like, [slight whine] "my parents molestered me."
Kyle
[straight] "My parents molestered me."
Cartman
No, but you've gotta cry, like this: [starts a fake sob, rubs his eyes] "My parents molestered me." [stops the fake cry] And then they'll say something like, "Was it a good touch or a bad touch?" and you say [rolls his eyes as he thinks] "Uh, it was a good touch" or- no wait, [points] you say it was a bad touch.
Kyle
What's "bad touch"?
Cartman
Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer "bad touch."
Kyle
Okay, molestered, bad touch.
Cartman
Yeah, And cry. [Kyle lets out a soft cry] Oh, he's ready.
Kyle's house, front lawn, day. Police and press gather round as the four boys and Ike watch by the driveway. Gerald and Sheila exit the house followed by two policemen. Two reporters try to ask them questions as cameras go off all around them
Sheila
Oh my God, this isn't happening. I would never touch my children like that.
Case Worker
[female] You do have the right to remain silent, ma'am. I suggest you use that right.
Sheila
Ugh, please, just listen to me! [Cartman chuckles as Kyle's parents are taken to the back door of a squad car] What about my children? Who will take care of them?
Case Worker
Oh, now you care?! They're going to live with their grandmother.
Sheila
Their grandmother's been dead for three years. [she is put into the back seat, and the door is shut. The window is rolled down] You're not listening to me. Kyle, tell these people that your- [the window is raised so her voice can't be heard clearly] mother never raped you! Tell them! It's my fault. Say it! Tell them right now!!
Case Worker
[walks up to Kyle] They'll never be able to hurt you again. [picks Kyle up and hugs him]
Kyle
Cool, thanks.
Case Worker
[drops Kyle and stands up] Alright, folks. Our work here is done. [police cars doors close, police cars zoom away, and everyone else disperses]
Stan/Kyle
[Cartman grins] Alright! [high-five each other]
Kyle's house, living room, shot of the hallway and stairs. "Old Time Rock 'N' Roll" plays. Kyle slides into view in his hat and underwear, facing away from the camera. He looks left and his sunglasses are shown. As the first words are sung, Kyle faces the camera and lip-syncs to them. With Chinpokomon around them, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman jump gleefully up and down on the sofa. In the kitchen Ike sticks a fork into the toaster. Kyle dances some more.Next scene is the Raging Pussies concert outside and inside a stadium. The four boys are in the audience, and Kyle is still in underwear.Next scene shows kids from all over descend on Kyle's house for a party at night. Everyone dances inside, some kids are eating pizza and Kyle is still in underwe
Stan
Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
Cartman
Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
Kids
Yeah, uh huh, woo hoo!
Stan's house, living room. He's on the phone crying. Next scene, his parents are hauled off by five cops. Shelly is shocked to see her parents go, but Stan begins to dance. She looks at him angrily and begins to pull her fist back. Stan stops dancing and points at her. A cop hauls her off. Stan resumes dancing. Kenny's house, living room. Kenny's on the phone. Next scene: his parents are being placed in the back seat of a squad car.Cartman's house, front door. The door opens and Liane is hauled out, then one man, then Chef. Cartman appears after them and stops at the door, and waves goodbye to them.South Park Elementary, Ms. Choksondik's class. In front of the class, she's hauled off. Then Principal Victoria is taken away, and then Mr. Mackey, as Butters accuses him of something to the case worker. Four panes appear, with a child in each one (Clyde, Francis, Red, and Token) calling the police. At the local bar police swarm in and the patrons scatter. Final shot: All the parents are gathered at the gates of Canyon City Maximum Security Prison
TV Announcer
The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.
Cartman
[slides up in front of the others] You guys! Come out here! [walks out the door. The other two follow, leaving Ike alone on the sofa.]
Downtown South Park. The sky is a deep blue and the streets are clear of snow. Token, Butters and Kenny stand behind Filmore and his friend. Cartman, Stan, Kyle, Ike, and Clyde
Stan
What's going on?
Cartman
Notice anything? [before them the town sits empty as the sun sits between two mountains in a red sky.] Watch. [takes a stone and throws it hard. It flies through the air and goes through a first-floor window on a building two blocks away]
Kyle
...Nothing.
Cartman
Yeah, nothing. There's not an adult left in town. [more kids gather] They've all been arrested, and the ones that weren't arrested have moved away because they're scared of being arrested
Kyle
Not one adult left?
Stan
[steps forward] ...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
The Rockies, some days later. A car winds its way down the winding road in a snow storm
Woman
Oh, sweetie, I have no idea where we are.
Man
I haven't seen a road marker for miles. What was the last highway we were on?
Woman
There has to be a town around here somewhere.
Man
Maybe you're reading the map wrong.
Woman
Hey, it was your idea to take the backroads. [both of them are suddenly shocked as the engine begins to falter]
Man
What the? [the speedometer goes down to 0 and the car begins to hobble] Oh no. No, no, no, no.
Woman
What's the matter with it?
Man
[worried] I have no idea. Oh, we're gonna have to find some help quick. We're not gonna make it more than a couple of miles.
Woman
Oh, look! There's a town up ahead. [the signpost for South Park appears, but "SMiLEy ToWN" appears in yellow over it. Underneath the sign, a clown mask appears while four balloons] Smiley Town? That's a strange name.
Man
Well, it'll have to do. It's probably the only town for a hundred miles. [they pass the sign.]
Smiley Town, a beat-up gas station. The car rolls up and the man and woman get out. The woman joins the man on the driver's side of the car.
Woman
Hello? Is anybody here? [so rustling is heard and Butters emerges from the garage in a mechanic's suit]
Butters
Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?
Man
...Yes, we need a mechanic to look at our car.
Butters
Oh, well-l-l, uh, I'm the mec-hanic, I guess. Woh-what seems to be the problem?
Man
...It's... just you here?
Butters
No, uh Craig's here, too.
Man
Oh, good.
Butters
But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! [Craig exits the office wearing a space outfit complete with helmet]
Craig
[approaches] What?
Man
Look we're in a bit of a spot here! I've got a very important job interview tomorrow morning in Breckenridge, so I have to get my car fixed fast! Is there another garage in town?
Butters
Huuuhhhh, no.
Man
How about a phone? Can we just use the phone?
Butters
Phone here doesn't work. Haa-I'm afraid the only phone that does work... is over in Treasure Cove.
Man
Fine! Can you take us there?
Craig
You... sure you wanna go to Treasure Cove?
Woman
Yes.
Butters
Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
Man
Yes.
Butters
Oh, alright then. [to Craig] Uh, show 'em where it is.
Downtown Smiley Town. Craig leads the couple down the streets to a white line running down the center of a cross street
Craig
[stops just short of the line] This is the end of Smiley Town. The only phone is somewhere in Treasure Cove. If you wanna find it, you're gonna have to cross the white line.
Man
Well, can you help us find the phone, please?
Craig
Hell no! I'm not crossing the white line.
Woman
Why not?!
Man
Alright, let's just... go, Linda. I don't have time for Spaceman Spiff's little games.
Craig
Craig.
Man
What?
Craig
It's Spaceman Craig. [walks away slowly, deliberately, making sci-fi sound effects as he walks. Linda and her husband look at each other baffled. They then walk forward...]
Downtown Treasure Cove. The couple walks into this town to the sound of ominous music. The town looks worse than Smiley Town does.
Two Small Voices
[off screen] Carousel. [the couple notices a shadow between two buildings. The shadow moves away quickly, and the couple walks on. More ominous music comes up as the walking resumes walking]
More Voices
Nah nah nanah nah! [a post falls over, scaring Linda into her husband's arms]
Man
Look, there's an elementary school [the school has been renamed Treasure Cove Elementary, and it is extremely trashed] Come on, there might be some teachers inside. [the couple heads for the school, but a toy Mega zips by them]
Linda
[holds on to her husband]What is that? [the truck turns around and comes back]WAAH [raises a foot to avoid being hit by the truck. The truck goes down the street, then turns around and returns once more, stopping in front of the frightened couple]What do you want from us??
Man
Linda, it's a remote-controlled car. [the truck repositions itself] Looks like maybe there's a little camera on it. [the couple is seen in a little monitor inside the school. The truck does have a camera in it]
Linda
Mark, I don't like this.
Mark
Relax, Linda, everything's fine. [looks closer at the truck. A little index finger presses on a button named Lemmin Juice. The truck ejects a stream of juice] Ow. [squirt] Ow. [rubs his eyes]
Linda
[panicking] What is it?! Acid?!
Mark
No, uh, it's lemon juice.
Linda
Oh God! Are you blind?!
Mark
No, it just really, really, really hurts!
Linda
Mark? Mark, look. [Mark rubs his eyes, then blinks them to focus. Before him is a line of kindergartners. The two sides stare at each other, then a girl steps forward] Well, hello. What's your name? [the girl just looks back at her] What- what do you want?
Jenny
We wanna play.
Linda
[panicked, rises] Mark, I'm scared!
Mark
[rises] Don't be scared. They're just kids. [to the kindergartners] Where are your parents?!
Filmore
We already played with our parents.
Jenny
How, we wanna play wit' youuuu. [points at the couple]
Mark
[silence] ...Okay, I'm scared now, too. That freaked me out.
Kindergartners
[come at the couple all at once] We wanna play wit' you! [jump on the couple]
Mark
Get off me! [twirls, but the kids don't fall off]
Linda
Oh God, Mark! Help! [the couple goes towards the dividing line between Smiley Town and Treasure Cove]
Filmore
[clinging onto Linda] Oh no! She's crossing the white line!
Kindergartners
Whoa! [fall off the couple and quickly rise to cross the line back to Treasure Cove. Spitballs come flying at them]
Kindergartner
Spitwads! [the launchers are seen: the sixth graders, Pip, Clyde, and Craig, with their straws.]
Craig
[space helmet off] Take that, kindergartners!
Kindergartners
Ew! [all turn to leave. Jenny is the last to go. The older kids and the couple watch them leave]
Mark
What the hell is gong on here?!
Craig
[space helmet back on] Kindergartners. Treasure Cove is full of them.
Mark
Alright, kid! We demand to see an adult this instant!
Craig
I got new orders. I'm supposed to take you to see the mayor.
Mark
The mayor! Good! Finally!
Smiley Town City Hall, day. Pictures of Cartman adorn the building and the path to the front door. A large inflatable King Kong floats above the snow and is tethered to the ground below. Craig and Butters lead Mark and Linda into the Mayor's office, where they face Cartman behind the desk, with Dog Poo and Francis as his assistants.. Clyde Frog sits on the desk at Cartman's right side, and his boombox is at left.
Cartman
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cotner. Won't you come in, please? [Mark and Linda look at each other] Mr. and Mrs. Cotner, as the mayor of Smiley Town, I would like to ask you a few questions.
Linda
You're the mayor? What the hell is gong on here?! Where are your parents?!
Cartman
Parents? [his left-hand assistant (Francis) whispers in his ear and withdraws] Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.
Mark
No parents in the entire town? What happened to them?
Cartman
Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
Linda
Look, just point us to a phone, kid, alright?
Cartman
Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
Mark
No phones, either? How do you communicate?
Cartman
[opens up an empty jar and speaks into it] Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. [closes the lid on the jar as Francis waits on him and hands the jar to Francis. He hops down and goes out the door]
Mark
Alright, we've had just about enough here! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen! I don't care what little games you kids wanna play, we just want outta here, alright? [the boy returns with the jar and hands it back to Cartman, who opens it up again]
Butter's Voice
It's gonna be about three days. [Cartman looks at the couple, who stand speechless]
Cartman
[tosses the jar aside, and it breaks] So, it appears that you need me. Which is good, because... I need you, too. [moves a plate of treats forward] Ringy-ding?
Mark
I have the job interview of my life in Breckenridge! Just tell me how to get to a phone or a car!
Francis
SpitBall!
Cartman
Aaahh! [jumps from his chair a second before a huge spitball crashes through the window and lands on the floor. He picks himself off the floor and goes to look out the window angrily] You sons of bitches! [turns to the couple] You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. [Mark and Linda, both unsure, look at each other]
Dividing line at the John Elway Memorial Park. The couple enters the park, Mark on the left side of the line, Linda on the right side
Linda
Mark, are we doing the right thing?
Mark
Look! If getting the stupid book will get me a cell phone, I don't care!
Linda
I just don't know if you're dealing with these kids the right way.
Mark
[stops and scolds] Well, I told you I can't deal with kids, Linda! That's why I don't want to have children!
Linda
[encouraging] Hey, I think you'd make a great father.
Mark
Oh, let's not go through this again, Linda. D- [moves forward again. Before them is a 20-ft John Elway statue.] Look, here's the book they've been talking about- [softly] it makes no sense.
Linda
My God! Mark! [in front of the statue is a small altar on which sit two kids. A dead dog is on the ground, and off to one side is a dead Kenny. Mark approaches him and inspects him closely] What is it??
Mark
It's a boy. [reaches down to touch Kenny. Kenny's left hand and arm have been eaten away, leaving only the bones. Kenny's head turns when Mark touches him, and only the skull remains] They... killed him.
Linda
The bastards. Oh, Mark, let's get out of here.
Kindergartners
Nah nah nanah nah!
Linda
Na-a-ah! [older kids in costume enter the park and line up behind the kindergartners]
Mark
Oh no! [they both turn, only to face another group of kids. Both groups close in on them]
Linda
Mark!
Mark
[to the kids] Uh. The fat kid told us to take it. [the angry mod captures them]
Treasure Cove Elementary, evening. Inside, Mark and Linda are tied, asleep and backs to each other, next to a bonfire.
Mark
[wakes up first] Wuh. Aah! Mark! Mark, wake up! [Mark awakens and both look at the group of kids, from kindergartners to fifth graders, staring back]
Kids
Nah nah nanah nah! [close in on the couple again]
Stan
You guys, stop it! [glides down from a tall pole in the school gym and jumps to a spot in front of the couple] Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
Kyle
[emerges from the group and stands next to Stan] Yeah. [these two head Treasure Cove]
Mark
Why are you doing this?
Stan
How come you wanna help the fatass?!
Mark
Who?
Kyle
The fatass. The mayor.
Mark
Look, I have the job interview of my life in less than- [struggles to view his watch, but finally does] -12 hours! I just need a phone, and he said he'd help me if I took your book so you couldn't... kill them anymore.
Stan
You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
Linda
Uh, how did this all happen? Why do you children live in this town alone?
Kyle
Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
Linda
But what about before that?
Stan
You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
Linda
Yes!!
Stan
If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
Mark
I'll do anything to get to a phone!
Stan
Alright. Everybody gather round. We're gonna tell the story of the before time again.
Kids
The Before time.
Boy
The story of the before time.
Stan
[with a torch, walks up to a chalk drawing on a wall of a family] Way back, in the long long ago, we all lived by the birth-givers' laws. But the birth-givers were unfair. They made us go to bed early and eat broccoli. [a drawing of broccoli is shown]
Kids
Yuck, yuck, yuck.
Stan
[walks past a drawing of Cartman] And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. [stops at a drawing of two police officers arresting an adult, with a squad car in the background], by using the magic M word. [a large M is shown]
Kids
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Stan
Soon we were without power, water, or fresh food. But we tried to survive. Under the guidance of... the Provider. [a drawing of a statue]
Kids
Provider. Provider.
Stan
The fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider. The fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal. So we made ourselves the superintendents of school. But then he just made himself the mayor. The town split sides and that's when the Provider got angry. [an angry Provider shoots bolts of lightning from his body, and two victims are at his feet]
Kids
Boo!
Boy
Bwack bwack!
Kids
Coosh!
Stan
So now, every night, the Provider must be appeased at Carousel. We need their book so one of ours doesn't die. [the two books are shown, with the line between them]
Kids
Carousel, Carousel.
Stan
We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
Mark
Ah-ah-ah-ah,let me get this straight: if I go get the fat kid's book on the other side of the white line, you'll show me where a cell phone is?
Stan
Yes. No foolies.
Kids
No foolies.
Treasure Cove Elementary, evening, outside. The couple is still inside
Mark
No, uh, it's it's it's right out here. Come on. [pushes the front door of the school and it falls away] Linda, I want you to just go back to the car and wait for me, alright? I'll go get that fat kid's book so I can use their phone.
Linda
Mark, I'm scared. [holds on to him]
Mark
I know, but this will all be over soon.
Canyon City Maximum Security Prison, day. Sheila, dressed in prison orange, is brought into a large room to join the other adults, and the door is locked behind her.
Sheila
Oh, Gerald, I haven't seen you for so long!
Gerald
Hello, honey, how has prison been for you?
Sheila
Oh, it's awful! Just awful.
Speaker
Alright parents, let's all take our seats. [Gerald and Sheila sit] My name is Scott Evans, and I am a prison rehabilitation counselor.
Randy
Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.
Gerald
Eh, neither did we.
Mrs. McCormick
We didn't, either.
Mr. Evans
Enough, enough! [all fall silent] Look, it's obvious we have a lot of emotional issues and personal demons to face here. During your prison time, you will all be spending one hour a day in therapy here with me. What I want you to do is learn to control those sick, sexual urges you have. Now we're gonna try an exercise: I'm gonna confront you with what you lust after most. [walks off and brings back a life-size stand-up of "Beaver" Cleaver] Alright parents, now I, I know this is difficult, but I want you to just look at this child. Just try to suppress your urges to rape him. [no response from the inmates] Just think about somethin' else. Think about clouds and beaches. Don't think about his supple, soft little body.
Gerald
Oh, that's disgusting!!! Now, now stop this!!
Mr. Evans
Fight your urges, Mr. Broflovski!
Gerald
I don't have any urges!
Mr. Evans
I can't help you if you won't admit you need help!! Now sit down! [Gerald thinks a moment, then sits down] Look, I know this is very difficult for all of you. Most of you are still in denial about what you've done! To you it seems you've never raped your children at all! But you did. Help meeee help youuuu. [the adults remain silent, no objections] Now let's try again. [genuflects] Look at this young man. Just look. Don't rape. Fight it. Fight it!
Smiley Town, street. Linda walks out from behind a van.
Linda
Oh God, God, please just let us out of this place. [reaches the gas station and is horrified by what she sees. The couple's car has been placed on blocks and thoroughly stripped of its parts. Butters comes out from behind the car with a window handle]
Butters
I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
Linda
[backs up] Oh no. NO! [turns around and stops in her tracks.] Aaaah! [Cartman's group faces her]
Cartman
Where is your husband?
Linda
Uh, uh...
Cartman
Seize her! [the others move forth]
Treasure Cove Elementary, evening, school gym. Mark has returned
Mark
Alright, I got the book for you. [hands it to Stan]
Stan
[receives it] Awesu-home!
Mark
Now, can I please have the cell phone?
Kyle
Sure, outlander. I'll get it [starts to move...]
Cartman
[outside] Outlander! [all look in the direction of the sound]
Treasure Cove Elementary, outside. Cartman, holding a taser, leads the Smiley Town members to the school. Linda is bound and gagged, but can still walk
Cartman
Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, outlander! Outlander, her blood was fair!
Butters
Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
Cartman
Butters, calm down, alright?
Canyon City Maximum Security Prison, day, meeting room.
Mr. Evans
Okay, so what are some other things that we can do besides molest our children?
Man
[in back row] See a movie?
Mr. Evans
Sure, "see a movie"'s good. [writes it down on the blackboard] We could see a movie instead of molesting our children. What else?
Mrs. McCormick
Make a sweater?
Mr. Evans
Uh huh. I'll put ah, "knitting, sewing." [writes them down] Who's got another one?
Blond Man
[to Liane's left] Molest children?
Mr. Evans
Nonono, we're looking for things to do besides molesting our children.
Blond Man
Oh. Fishing?
Mr. Evans
Fishing's good. Uh huh. [writes that down]
John Elway Memorial Park, night. The two towns meet at the dividing line, Linda with Smiley Town, Mark with Treasure Cove.
Cartman
I believe you have something of ours, outlander! Give it back, or the female gets it! [gives her a small shock]
Linda
Mmrrhhhh!
Cartman
Heh, heheh.
Linda
Rrrmm-mmrrhh!
Mark
Give him the book back.
Stan
No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
Cartman
We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
Mark
Enough of this! You kids are all in big trouble! [goes to ungag his wife, and the statue's clock begins to peal: 8:00 p.m. An electric current makes its way down to a pool of water and returns to the statue, electrifying it. The right arm, holding a football, moves forward]
Cartman
The Provider awakes!
Stan
It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
Cartman
Aw, damnit! Alright. [gets formal] It is decided. [points, in normal voice] Butters, your turn. [other kids back away. Tweek and another boy take Butters away.]
Butters
Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
Mark
Stop right there! Nobody's killing anybody tonight!
Linda
Be careful, Mark. They'll make you disappear with the M word.
Cartman
Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
Mark
What? [Butters makes his way to the altar on the dividing line. Tweek and three others monitor him]
Butters
I'm here for you, Provider! Uh, take me! [Tweek and the other three chain him up]
Mark
Is that what happened to the adults here?! You lied to the police and said they molested you?! My God, they were your parents!
Stan
[all the kids turn from the altar and face the couple] Parents?
Mark
The birth-givers! Your birth-givers. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Don't you remember? They are your providers! Not some statue! And they're not up in some fantastical faraway land now. [beings to walk into the mob of kids] They're in prison. Probably crying themselves to sleep, cold and lonely and... I'm sure missing you all very, very much. [Filmore and Jenny look at each other. Cartman gazes] Your birth-givers took care of you. That's what their laws and their rules were for, because they love you, and they didn't want you to end up living like... th-this! [motions to the statue of John Elway] He won't take care of you. Your parents... your... providers... will.
Kyle
Parents. Mom. Dad.
Butters
Oh boy, here it comes!
Mark
[moves through the crowd again] If you want things to be the way they were in the before time, in the long, long ago, you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them M word. [stands next to Linda]
Stan
He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
Kyle
Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
Mark
Ten days?? It's only been ten days since they left??
Cartman
Take him down. [Tweek and the other three unchain Butters]
Butters
Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
Kyle
Here's our cell phone, dude. [hands it to Mark] Will you call the police for us? [Mark begins dialing]
Linda
Hey. Looks like you're not so bad with kids after all.
Mark
Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe we should have some.
Linda
Yeah, right. After all this, I'm getting my tubes ties tomorrow! [turns around and starts walking away. Mark is surprised]
South Park, day, neighborhood street. The town has been cleaned up. The kids stand in front of a house waiting for a bus to roll up. Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Craig hold a banner among them which reads, red letters on yellow background, "Welcome Home, PARENTS!" Butters walks up
Stan
Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
Kyle
Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
Stan
Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
Linda
[shows up with Mark] Hey, kids.
Stan
Hey, you guys came back!
Kyle
Did you make it to your job interview?
Mark
Yeah. I got the job. You're looking at the new manager of Denny's in Breckenridge.
Linda
And I got my tubes tied.
Kids
Alright!
Kyle
Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
Kids
Yeah.
Butters
Hey! Here they come! [the sound of a bus is heard. It pulls up and the parents pour out, beginning with the Broflovskis]
Kyle
Mom! Dad!
Sheila
Kids! [all the parents rush to their kids and hug them]
Parents
...Come here, come here.
Sheila
[holds Ike] Oh, Kyle. Ike, sweetie, you're OK. [Gerald hold Kyle]
Kyle
Yeah. We're fine.
Gerald
Kyle, we're so sorry for the horrible sexual abuse over the years. But we're all better now.
Kyle
But you didn't do anything to me.
Gerald
Hup, we did. We've come to terms with it through therapy and learned to admit it.
Sheila
It won't happen again. [She and Gerald turn and walk off with Ike.]
Kyle
[lags] But, you guys, I--
Sharon
[she and Randy hold Stan] Oh, Stanley, I wish we could take back all the years of abuse, but we can't.
Liane
[genuflects next to Cartman] We've learned to overcome it, son. You'll see.
Stephen Stotch
We love you, son, but we only love you in a platonic way from now on.
Butters
Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
Mrs. McCormick
[walks with Stuart] Kenny? Kenny, we're sorry. Where is he?
Jenny's Mother
[she and the father hold Jenny] Everything's gonna be alright now, Jenny. [Jenny's father lets go] Come on, let's go home. [the families begin to disperse. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stay behind.]
Stan
Huh.
Kyle
Huh.
Mark
[walks up with Linda] Well, what are you kids gonna do now?
Stan
I dunno. [to Kyle and Cartman] You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
Kyle
Sure. [the boys turn left and start walking]
Cartman
Snow igloos kick ass. [Mark and Linda stare as if the events of the last ten days didn't leave an impression on the boys]
End of The Wacky Molestation Adventure

A Very Crappy Christmas
Kyle's house, night, bathroom. The toilet is seen and on it are a glass and a plate of chocolate-chip cookies. Kyle sits in his pajamas underneath a window and next to a night stand and candle opposite the toilet bowl, and holding a small flag which reads: WELCOME MR. HANKEY. Ike walks in and towards the food
Kyle
He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.
Ike
[pulls himself onto the seat and looks in] Oooh nooo, poopies.
Kyle
Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike. [lifts him off the seat and takes him back to the night stand] Come sit by me. [they sit down and face the toilet bowl, and wait. Nothing happens.]
Sheila
[at the door with Gerald] It's getting late, boys. Why don't you come on up to bed.
Kyle
Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
Sheila
Alright, bubbe. [leaves with Gerald, but returns] Oh, and boys? Happy Chanukah.
Kyle
Happy Chanukah, Mom. [returns his sight to the toilet bowl and waits...]
Kyle's house, night, bathroom. "Silent Night" plays
Ike
[Waves the flag around] Ayaaa ta. [Kyle is getting drowsy] Weee! Weee... [soon, Ike is asleep on Kyle's shoulder as Kyle drifts into sleep, but checks on the plate once in a while. An ant is now on the toilet seat inching its way to the cookies. Kyle watches drowsily until the ant touches the cookies...]
Kyle
Go away!
The ant scurries away. At length, the candle burns down to the plate and goes out. Kyle and Ike are both asleep. Sheila and Gerald look in once again and find the boys asleep. Sheila picks up Ike and Gerald picks up Kyle and take them to their respective rooms. Kyle is then seen asleep in his room. He opens and blinks his eyes, then gasps and sits up. He rushes out of bed and into the restroom, only to find an empty plate and glass. He thinks Mr. Hankey has been by, until he notices something on the floor to the left of the toilet. A look of dismay comes over his face. It's the ant he sees, now bloated and content. Kyle goes to make a phone call.
Stan's house, night, bathroom. "Silent Night" continues
Stan
[picks up the phone] A-ah huh.
Kyle
[barks. Music stops] Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
Stan
Ho-o-oh.
South Park, night, bus stop. Kyle, with flashlight and crow bar, is waiting as the others arrive. Kenny arrives in coat, hood, and undies. Cartman in pajamas, cap and coat, and Stan fully dressed, but with his cap askew. A lock of hair is seen
Kyle
Okay, good. You're all here.
Stan
What is this all about, Kyle?
Kyle
It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
Cartman
Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. [turns aside and walks off]
Kyle
It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
Cartman
Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
Kyle
If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
South Park, night, city streets. Snow is still falling, but a manhole cover has been lifted and set aside. Down below, in the sewer, the boys walk in the muck looking for Mr. Hankey's home
Cartman
Heh-tchoo!
Kyle
[turns and glares at Cartman] Dude, you sneezed on my back!
Cartman
Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
Kyle
Hey, look. [before them is a small cottage in a collection basin. They walk to the end of the sewer line] Hello?
Mr. Hankey
Hoowwddyy ho! [behind him is a little cottage all glittered in light]
Kyle
...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
Mr. Hankey
Oh, no I'm fine, Kyle.
Kyle
But where have you been? Things aren't the same without you. Nobody seems to have the Christmas spirit.
Mr. Hankey
I know, Kyle. I've just been awfully busy with my family. [calls into the house] Honey!
Cartman
Family?
Mr. Hankey
Boys, I want you to meet my wife. Autumn.
Autumn
Howdy-hey kids! [waves in the same way Mr. Hankey does, holds a martini in her left hand] Would you like a drink?
Mr. Hankey
They're too young to drink, honey.
Autumn
Hey haa, it's Christmas!
Mr. Hankey
Come. You have to meet the little nuggets, too. Kids! [they come one one by one] This is our son, Cornwallis.
Cornwallis
[wearing glasses, a scarf and little blue beret] Hoowwdy Ho! [hops aside as another nugget enters]
Mr. Hankey
Our daughter Amber.
Amber
[in pink dress and maroon bow] Hoowwdy Ho! [hops aside as another nugget enters]
Mr. Hankey
And our son, Simon.
Simon
Eee, hey! Hnhn.
Mr. Hankey
[aside] Simon's not so smart. He was born with a peanut in his head.
Siimon
Heh What? Dad? Huh?
Mr. Hankey
Nothin', Simon.
Kyle
A family! So THAT's why you haven't been able to spread Christmas cheer.
Mr. Hankey
It sure has been tough. Nobody seems that into Christmas out there.
Stan
I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
Cartman
My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
Mr. Hankey
Well don't worry kids! I'm sending the nuggets up tomorrow to spread Christmas cheer! [the nuggets grin] And if you want, you can help them.
Kyle
Sure we'll help! [Stan grins]
Cartman
Anything for more presents!
Autumn
"Hic" Weh-hell, it's a Christmas party! Hey! You boys! You boys wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes?
Mr. Hankey
Honey, pleh, you're- you're drunk. Onkay?
Autumn
But it's a Christmas party!
Mr. Hankey
Honey, can we go inside for a second? [they enter the little house and start arguing. The boys look on in shock while the nuggets keep their smiles. Abruptly the arguing stops and the two adult poos step out again] Well, it's decided, kids. Tomorrow we're gonna bring back the spirit of Christmas!
South Park, day, city streets. The boys and the nuggets stand on the sidewalk in front of Tele's and the toy store humming "Good King Wencelas" The nuggets soon hum their own tunes. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny wear nose clips and suits that suggest they are reindeer, while Cartman is dressed as Santa
Cartman
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas, you guys! Only three shopping days until- [a couple walks past] God-damnit! [a man walks past in the other direction] Hey! Merry Christmas, asshole! [a woman walks by]
Stan
Nobody's paying any attention. [Amber clears her throat as a foot comes down over Simon, and the foot pulls away]
Woman
Ew, I almost stepped in it.
Tele's Owner
[exits and locks his door] Well, it was a good effort, boys. But I'm gonna have to close shop. Nobody's buyin' anything an' I can't afford to keep this furnace runnin'! [starts to leave, but notices the nuggets] Oh. And, boys, there's some crap on the sidewalk there. Watch out. [the nuggets look downcast. Red Harris leaves the toy store.]
Red
[locks the door] Not one toy. I guess this yeear, everyone's content to celebrate with candles and love. [starts sobbing, then walks away]
Stan
[emotionally] This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
A special report. Behind the anchor is a "No Christmas Trees" sign
News Anchor
And in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially SICK OF CHRISTMAS! [a chart appears] In an SPC poll, 38% said they were fed up and tired of the holiday, 5% said they were indifferent to it, and a whopping 57% they would quick Bon Jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity. [the field poll follows]
Ms. Choksondik
Well, I think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills, uh. [the boys sit on Cartman's sofa watching the news] I, I think that the holiday just has become a joke.
Man
[with a son who waves at the camera] You know, it's just that a lot of people don't really believe in the whole Jesus thing anymore, you know? So what's to celebrate?
Man 2
Oh yeah. Right in the balls, man. Right square in the balls.
News Anchor
Well, the holiday spirit may be gone from South Park, but at least our faith in each other remains strong.
Assistant
[whispers into the anchor's ear] In South Park.
News Anchor
Oh really?
South Park, Cartman's house, day. The report is over
Stan
Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. [Cartman clicks the remote, and "A Charlie Brown Christmas" pops up. Charlie, Lucy, and Snoopy are on screen]
Charlie Brown
Good Grief! We need a Christmas tree for our play.
Cartman
Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.
Stan
How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
Charlie
[as other kids dance around him] Alright, everyone, we've got to get on with our play!
Kyle
Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
Cartman
Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
Stan
[affecting a Peanuts accent] And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
Cartman
My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
Kyle
Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it! [drops down from the sofa and walks to the TV] It's so simple!
Stan
What, dude?
Kyle
[turns and faces the other boys] We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! [Charlie and Linus talk onscreen]
Stan
We don't know anything about animation.
Kyle
How hard can it be? Look at it. [Snoopy and Charlie walk in the woods]
Cartman
Hey yeah! We can make a little animated Santa Claus and Jesus, and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys!
Kenny
(Yeah, right! Awesome!)
Stan
Yeah! And we can call it... "The Spirit of Christmas" [onscreen, Snoopy is pummeling a naked Charlie Brown hard across the face with a 2-by-4]
South Park, The Mayor's office, day. The report is over
Mayor
[worried] Ogh! This is terrible, Johnson! Our whole town's economy is going right in the toilet! We've got to get everybody back in the Christmas spirit!
Aide 2
Mayor, some adorable children are here to see you.
Mayor
Meugh. Send them in.
Kyle
[as the boys enter]Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
Mayor
You do?
Kyle
We're gonna make a short animated Christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in.
Stan
It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
Mayor
[falsely enthusiastic] An animated Christmas card. Kids, that just may be the dumbest idea I've ever heard, ever!
The Boys
Awww.
Mayor
But at this point I'm willing to try anything. Johnson, cut them a check for three hundred dollars.
The Boys
Alright!
Kyle
[to the other three] You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
The Hankey home, day, exterior. Mr. Hankey and Autumn are in a heated argument inside. The argument is incomprehensible for a while, until a voice stands out.
Mr. Hankey
Now you put that vase down! Put that vase down! That's a very expensive vase! [now warning] Don't you throw that vase! [the vase is thrown and breaks.]
Kyle
[now facing the house from the sewer] Ah, Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey
[exits the front door] Oh, Kyle! Hoowwddy ho!
Kyle
[excited] We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
Mr. Hankey
Oh, that's swell! Kids! [the nuggets come out] Christmas is back on! We've gotta all go get that old drive-in workin' again.
The Nuggets
Okay!
Autumn
That's not the only thing we gotta get workin' again, [pokes him] if you know what I mean...
Mr. Hankey
[concerned] Wha- why do you, why do you have to say things like that in front of people?
Kyle
Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. [turns and walks away...]
Mr. Hankey
Good luck, Kyle. And we'll have that projector workin'! Don't you worry! [Cornwallis sniffs at himself]
Amber
What's the matter, Cornwallis?
Butters' home, day. A gate is open by one side of the house. Inside, the four boys enter a room littered with cutouts
Kyle
Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.
Butters
[behind a desk] Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
Stan
[impatient] Yeahyeahyeah. just let us see 'em!
Butters
Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus. [holds him up and moves him a bit] "Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus. [brings him forth] "Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff." [Santa] "Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose." Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. [unfurls a large sheet which contains some mountains and spitting images of the four boys]
The boys
Whoa!
Cartman
[points] Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.
Stan
[retorts] That's not me, that's you!
Cartman
What?!
Kyle
They kind of look like us. [the poster is shown again] I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
Cartman
I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! [Butters sets the poster on the desk, face up]
Kyle
God job, Butters.
Butters
Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
Stan
[grabs the poster] No, that's okay. [walks away]
Kyle
See ya! [grabs Santa, Cartman grabs Jesus, and they walk away with Kenny]
Butters
Uh-m, alright, alright then. [the door closes, and a few second later, he reaches into a top drawer and pulls out a Barbie cutout. In falsetto...] "Oh, uh, hello, good-lookin'? What's your name?" [moves the Butters cutout] "Huh, Butters, ma'am." [moves the Barbie cutout while in falsetto] "Well, Butters, would you like to slap my- titties around?" [moves the Butters cutout closer] "Whoa! Well, uhuh" [a smile of fantasy flashes across his face] "Uh, no thanks, ma'am. Uh I, I'll get in trouble again." [guiltily puts the cutout away.]
The Hankey home, day. Inside, Cornwallis is seated at a table with thumb tacks for legs. There are two 5-book stacks on the table, a third stack on the floor behind him, and two books on the floor in front of the table. Mr. Hankey enters, and soon seen are a spool of string for a bedstand and a pencil as a curtain rod. A locket hangs over Cornwallis' bed, and it contains pictures of his parents
Mr. Hankey
Cornwallis, we've got to go fix up the drive-in.
Cornwallis
I don't want to, Dad. I'm too sad.
Mr. Hankey
[takes a seat at the table] Hey, that's alright, Cornwallis. The boys' animated movie will being back the spirit of Christmas.
Cornwallis
It's not that, father. Its... Well, I don't feel like I'm really a part of Christmas.
Mr. Hankey
But son, you're a Hankey. We love Christmas!
Autumn
[drunk as ever, appears at the door] Come on, it's time to sit around the tree!
Mr. Hankey
[serious] We're having a talk, honey.
Autumn
God-damnit it's Christmas and we're gonna be a happy family around the tree!
Mr. Hankey
Autumn, you're drunk. Alright, now, just go help the other kids; they can't get their stockings up.
Autumn
That's not the only thing that can't get up around here. [rushes away]
Mr. Hankey
...Now come on, son. Don't be so down.
Cornwallis
Why? We're just pieces of crap. Christmas isn't for us.
Mr. Hankey
Christmas is about feeling good. That's for everybody!
Cornwallis
I see the Nativity. There's angels, shepherds and sheep. But no poo. All the Christmas movies: Santa, elves, reindeer. No poo. I'm not a part of it.
Mr. Hankey
No, you're not a part of it, Cornwallis. You're all of it. Don't you see?
Cornwallis
I'm nothing but crap!
Mr. Hankey
But crap is everything. [begins to sing]
Everything that lives on earth poos in some way
And that's how the cycle happens, each and every day
[Takes Cornwallis out and up to the street]
Just look at the green green grass and the birds up in the sky
[cows graze on the some exposed grass while large birds fly lazily above]
It's all here because of poo, and now I'll tell you why

Grass it's eaten by cattle, which is eaten by women and men
[A cow poops as it eats, then Butters' family is shown eating burgers at table]
It fuses with their bodies and becomes poo again
[Mr. Hankey sings to Cornwallis, then Butters' father is shown straining on the toilet]
And that poo goes through the sewer, where it's dumped into the sea.
[some poo descends through the pipe, and Mr. Hankey soon follows. A raw sewage outlet is then shown with Mr. Hankey exiting]
And it's eaten by the plankton, and becomes the fishes' meal.
[plankton swarm the poo and devour it; a small fish eats the plankton]

And then that bigger fish with the poo still inside
[a bigger fish eats the small fish, but an even bigger one approaches]
Swims up near the shore and gets eaten alive
[the bigger fish swallows the medium-sized one and swims up to the surface, only to be snatched up by a bear]
By the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sand
[the bear walks off with the fish in its mouth and poos as he leaves]
So it can spring to life and become food for the land!
[flowers and grass spring up through and around it. The camera pulls back to reveal an African savannah around the flowers, with all sorts of animals in it]

It's the poo of the antelope, the poo of the giraffe
[soft backup vocals come on, lending the song an African feel. antelope run in the background as a giraffe appears and stops]
It falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grass
[The camera looks at Mr. Hankey and Cornwallis atop Poo Rock, first from the back, then from the front]
The grass is eaten by the cattle, which comes out the other end
[more cattle are shown grazing and pooing]
To make food for the humans and start all over again
[a man scoops the poo into a small bag and walks off; Butters and family eat more burgers; his mom sits on the toilet]
[back on Poo Rock, before which animals poo freely]

You see, son? You're not an insignificant part of life. You are life.

Cornwallis
But how can I be that giraffe and blade of grass, and a human? I don't control what they do.
Mr. Hankey
[sits next to Cornwallis] Just like your heart beats without you thinking about it, so, too, your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin' about it. But it is all one life form. It is all... [points to him] you.
Cornwallis
[smiles] I think I see now.
I'm the poo of the antelope, that flows down to the ground
[steps forward]

Mr. Hankey
Becomes the grass of tomorrow

Cornwallis
Yeah

Mr. Hankey
Which the grazers turn around

[An antelope stops to poo a little, then runs off to join the others]

Cornwallis
So I'm the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen

Mr. Hankey, Cornwallis
Which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo again.
[Mr. Hankey holds Cornwallis high in the air on Poo Rock with the sky behind them. Cornwallis hums a bit]
That's the Circle, the Circle of Poo!
[Cut to black]

Stan's house, basement, day. He hands out scripts to the other three boys
Stan
Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
Kyle
No ending? Well, we can't animate until we have our voices recorded, so we'd better just record what we have and figure out the ending later. [they walk over to some microphones.]
Sound man
[instructing] Okay, talk directly in the mike and don't hit any hard p's.
Kyle
What's a hard p?
Cartman
You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
Kyle
Oh, yeah.
Sound man
Uumm, okay, sound is speeding, and... [cues the boys by raising his hand]
The boys
We wish you a Merry Christmas

Sound man
Hold on.
Kyle
We wish-

[the sound man presses a few buttons, and some white noise blasts through the boys' headphones]
The boys
[twisting in pain] AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
Cartman
...deh..OOOWW!!!
Sound man
Uh, [makes more changes to the sound settings] mmm. Okay, and? [cues the boys]
Boys
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas--

Stan
Hey! Wait a minute!
Kyle
What?
Stan
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
Kyle
Well, yes, I think so.
Stan
[calmly] Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas. You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs. [Kyle cues the piano player, who begins playing]
Kyle
Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--

Cartman
[grins] Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.
Kyle
[throws his headphones off and faces Cartman angrily] Don't you oppress me, fat boy.
Cartman
[throws his headphones off] Don't call me fat, buttfucker.
Kyle
Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
Stan
You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! [the sound man begins to laugh heartily]
Sound man
[composes himself] Dude, that was awesome.
Stan
What's awesome?
Sound man
The script. It's sweet.
Stan
That's not in the script They do this all the time.
Sound man
Well, it should be in the script. All that "you're fat" and "you're a Jew" and stuff. It's great. [the boys look at each other]
South Park, Photo Dojo, day. The boys are gathered round a camera, which is pointing straight down onto the poster Butters made for them. Two lights shine on the poster, and the cutouts are in place. Some other heads are at the top end of the poster
Kyle
Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
Stan
Easy.
Kyle
Yeah. So what's the first syllable?
Stan
Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
Kyle
Okay. So we put little "woo" mouths on all our heads. [sets the "woo" mouths in place] And then we shoot that for one frame.
Stan
Okay. [snaps the shot] One.
Kyle
That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! [exults]
Stan
Kickass!
Kyle
Now, the next mouth.
Stan
Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. [both turn aside to look around]
Kyle
Okay, where are the E-mouths?
Stan
[softly] E mouths...
South Park, Photo Dojo, three hours later. The boys' eyelids are drooping and they're tired
Kyle
Okay. "Woo" mouths again?
Stan
[snap] 1 [snap] 2.
Kyle
So how much done is that?
Stan
"We wish you a m- Merry"
Kyle
[softly] Aw, [loudly] Jesus Christ!
South Park Drive-In, night. The boys' eyelids are drooping and they're tired
Mayor
[enters the drive-in with her aides] This kids better make a good Christmas movie, Johnson. If people in this town don't start shopping again, we're all gonna be out of jobs next year.
Johnson
This... place is pretty run-down.
Mayor
It's alright, we've got a clean-up crew coming.
Mr. Hankey
[off-screen] Hoowwddy ho! [the Mayor and Johnson look around] Down here!
Johnson
[jumps back] WAAGGH!
Mayor
[displeased] Oh. Mr. Hankey, it's you. How wonderful.
Mr. Hankey
My family and I are here to get the drive-in ready for the biig movie.
Autumn
[drunk and still holding a martini, to Johnson] Hi there, Mr. Important Political Person. *hic* [Johnson looks disturbed] You wanna bet me I won't take off my clothes and run naked through this parkin' lot?
Mr. Hankey
[softly blocking] Uh-uh, honey, please don't start!
Autumn
I didn't start it! He was looking at my breasts!
Mr. Hankey
They're not real, you know.
Autumn
Don't you say that! [hugs him, but he pushes her off]
Mr. Hankey
Oh, big secret! Everyone can tell they're made of silicorn!
Johnson
Uhhh, we'll just leave you to your cleanup. [leads the Mayor and the other aide away]
Mr. Hankey
Okay! Boy, oh boy, this place suuure needs a lot of work.
Cornwallis
We can fix it up, Dad.
Amber
Oh, look! A homeless person. [the man is seen sleeping on the ground covered in papers and cardboard] Oh. He looks sad, Papa. [hops over to him and leaves a poo smile on his lips] There. That's better.
Mr. Hankey
Good job, Amber. Now this place is starting to look Christmasy [the man continues to sleep...]
South Park, Photo Dojo, next day. The boys are back at the animatic further along in the project
Kyle
Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. [Cartman sneezes and immediately realizes what he just did]
Stan
AAAAAAAA!
Kyle
Cartman!
Cartman
Well, I'm sorry! I have a cold!
Stan
That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
Cartman
Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways! [walks off and stops at the door] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!
Kyle
[rushing to the door] Fine! We'll do it with out you!
Stan
We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
Kyle
We'll dub his voice over.
Stan
Kyle, it's hopeless. We've only got 20 seconds of animation done, and we still have Jesus' and Santa's voices to record, and we don't even have a third act. Dude, it would take a miracle to finish this thing!
Kyle
Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.

To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.

You hope, and I'll hurry.
[takes the poster and rolls it up.]
You pray, and I'll plan
[The boys exit the Photo Dojo with it]
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
[now in Stan's room, works on a Brian Boitano cutout]
Even a miracle needs a hand!
[walks up to the wall and adds a scene to Act II]

Kyle
You love-

Stan
We love

Kyle
-And I'll labor. [takes down the scene]

Stan
Tralala

Kyle
You sit- [puts it up again]

Stan
We sit.

Kyle
-And I'll stand. [a funny look appears on his face]

Stan
Tralalalala

!Boys
Get help from our next-door neighbor, 'cause

[Kenny begins to hum as the Hankey family is shown cleaning up the drive-in]

Boys, Hankeys
Even a miracle needs a hand!

[Autumn is passed out to one side of the film projector as Mr. Hankey cleans up]

Stan's house, basement, day. Stan and Kyle have to work without Cartman, so they stand wearing headphones and reading the script aloud
Kyle
You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?
Stan
"Awgh! I'm so fat!"
Kyle
Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.
Stan
[with tongue filling his mouth] "Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!"
Kyle
Cool! Now let's try the script!
Sound Man
Rolling...
Stan
[Doing his and Cartman's parts]
Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!

Kyle
Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
Stan
Cartman: Ey! I don't need to take that kind of shit from a Jew! [both boys grin, and the sound man signals his approval with a thumbs-up]
Stan's house, living room, day. Kyle and Stan resume singing as Kyle packs the cutouts into a box headed for Korea
Kyle
You wish-

Stan
We wish

Kyle
-And I'll whittle.

Stan
Tralalalala

Kyle
You sit- [closes the box and tosses it up]

Stan
We sit.

Kyle
-And I'll stand. [displays the box's destination and walks out with it]

Stan
Tralalalala

Kyle
[with Kenny humming] Let's all try to help a little, 'cause
[A group of 20 Korean inbetweeners are shown working hard on the short]

South Park, Potter's Art Store, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk out with construction paper
Boys
Even a miracle- [a car comes in and runs over Kenny as the driver honks, leaving Kenny flat as a pancake. The boys just look in wonder]

Stan
...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. [they resume singing and walk away]
Stan's house, living room, day. Stan and Kyle are there. A large box has come for Stan and he's about to open it
Stan, Kyle
South Park Drive-In, night. The drive-in is cleaned up now. The entire town shows up to see the short film. To the left, two klieg lights shine on a high platform on which stand the Mayor and her aides; Stan, Kyle, and Cartman. A decorated Christmas tree stands behind them. On close-up, though, Cartman is missing
Mayor
Citizens of South Park, the Colorado Film Commission is pleased to present to you a work by some of our very own South Park children. [the crowd erupts in applause]
Cartman
[enters victoriously] Thank you, thank you. [Stan and Kyle look at him annoyed]
Kyle
Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
Cartman
What are you talkin' about, "quit"? Huh! I don't remember that.
Mayor
We know that after you see this darling short film, [the crowd is shown] you will all feel the mighty glow of the Christmas spirit once again. Boys?
Kyle
Okay, Mr. Hankey!
Mr. Hankey
[in the booth] O-kay! [starts the projector. The opening screen of "The Spirit of Christmas" is shown as music plays.]
Scene: a snowy hill. South Park comes into view. A squirrel pops up to see the camera, then drops away next to the town sign. Kids can be heard singing a Christmas carol. The camera pans to the right
Kids
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas--

Stan
Hey! Wait a minute!
Kyle
What?
Stan
Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
Kyle
Yeah, I think so.
Stan
(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
Kyle
What?
Stan
You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
Kyle
Dreidel dreidel dreidel-

the film snaps in two and grinds to a halt. Fear strikes the boys' faces, then the Mayor's face. The film spools out of the reels and Mr. Hankey holds the unwound film in his hands
Simon
Eehhhh, pretty! [the crowd begins to disperse and grumble]
Man
Oh, that's Christmas for ya.
Mayor
Uhuh, just hang on folks. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.
Man 2
Boring.
Man 3
I've gotta go.
Man 4
Stupid.
Mr. Hankey
[as the boys enter the projection booth] It's completely destroyed! There's nothin' I can do!
Kyle
All that hard work.
Mayor
Well, thanks a lot, kids. Great idea you had there. Now everyone is more disenfranchised with Christmas than ever. We want our three hundred bucks back!
Kyle
But we spent it!
Mayor
Fine. Then we'll sue you. [leaves with the aides] Johnson? [the other aide stays behind]
Aide
I... used to believe in miracles. [leaves]
Kyle
All that work!
Stan
For nothing.
Mr. Hankey
Boys, I uh, I'm s-, I'm sorry.
Kyle
Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.
Cartman
I guess- we might as well- go home now. [the boys leave and Mr. Hankey wilts]
The Hankey home, night. Inside, Mr. Hankey sits on the little sofa. Cornwallis hops up to him and joins him on the sofa
Mr. Hankey
It's my fault. All my fault. I got everyone's hopes up.
Cornwallis
But Dad, we can fix the projector.
Mr. Hankey
Aw, it's too late for that, son. everyone' gone home. And I don't know nothin' about projectors. I'm just a stupid piece of crap.
Cornwallis
Dad, you taught me an important lesson: That crap is the cycle of everything.
Mr. Hankey
Aw, that was just a stupid song, Cornwallis! I was jus' tryin' to get you to stop your bitchin'
Cornwallis
No, it wasn't a stupid song. Because you showed me that I have the power and the strength to do anything I want. You made me believe in myself, Dad! Now I'm asking you to do the same.
Mr. Hankey
Son... [reflects for a moment] You're the smartest piece of crap since Albert Poodinger! Come on! [the two of them leave the house]
The Marsh house, living room, night. The immediate family is gathered
Sharon
Isn't this a nice Christmas, Stanley? No commercialism and shopping, just a nice fire and family.
Grandpa
I wanna die. [sleigh music is heard and a light soon fills the air outside. All the Marshes look]
A view of the suburbs. Lights come on all over the neighborhood, and families begin to come out of their houses. one girl and her parents, another girl and her parents, a boy and girl and their parents, etc. The light everyone sees is the drive-in screen. The short has been repaired and is airing the scene where the boys first meet Jesus. The drive-in soon fills up
On screen, Jesus floats down from the sky.
Kyle
What the--
Kenny
(Nooo!!) [tightens his hood]
The Broflovski house, night. The front door opens and Gerald and Sheila step out with Ike. Kyle follows them out.
Kyle
They did it! They got it working! [closes the door behind him]
On screen.
Jesus
You have blemished the meaning of Christmas for the last time, Kringle!
Santa
I bring happiness and love to children all over the world.
Jesus
Christmas is for celebrating my birth!
Santa
Christmas is for giving!
A shot of the audience
Crowd
Oh, wow!
The Hankey house. Amber and Simon stand outside
Amber
Mom! They got it working!
Autumn
[opens the front door and exits without closing it] What's that? They got your father's penis workin' again? [the three of them leave]
A shot of Stan, Kyle, and Cartman smiling. On screen...
Kyle
...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
Stan
Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu. Christmas still is about one very important thing.
Cartman
Yeah, ham.
Stan
[angrily] No not ham!
The audience. The boys laugh
Cartman
Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
Kyle
Heheh, we could make you say whatever we wanted.
On screen...
Stan
...Christmas is about something much more important!
Kyle
What?
Stan
[voice softens] Presents.
Kyle
[softly] Ah.
Stan
Don't you see, Kyle?
Kyle
Yeah.
Stan
Presents.
The audience...
Various Folk
...Presents.
Man 5
My God, they're right!
Mr. Mackey
Christmas is about presents. If we all buy presents, everyone benefits. M'kay?
Randy
That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
Mayor
They're starting to understand, Johnson.
Ms. Choksondik
We got so caught up in the little things of Christmas, like love and family that... we almost forgot it's buying things that makes our economy thrive.
Mayor
[wearing a handlebar mustache, in falsetto] Hey, the shops are still open. We still have time to shop. [the crowd starts to clamor in agreement, and soon the shops around South Park turn their lights on. Red Harris opens his toy shop up, and the crowd fills the streets, first cheering, then chatting]
Kyle
You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
Mr. Hankey
No, you did it, boys!
Autumn
Aw, hell, we all did it!
Mayor
Kids, that cartoon was fabulous. How would you like to have your own show and make 100 more of them?
Stan
Are you kidding? I think we'd rather stab ourselves in the head.
Cartman
Yeah. Let's just go home and open our presents.
Kyle
[to Stan] Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
Stan
Wow! Count me in!
Cartman
Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
Boys
[leaving with the Mayor]
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
I made you out of clay
Dreidel dreidel dreidel
With dreidel I will play!

End of A Very Crappy Christmas. Rats rush in from all sides and nibble on Kenny's body.
End of A Very Crappy Christmas


It Hits the Fan
Morning, bus stop. Stan and Kenny wait for the bus, and Kyle arrives.
Kyle
[joining the two other boys] Hey you guys! Look what I have!
Stan
What?
Kyle
Four tickets to The Lion King on stage!
Stan and Kenny
[pause] ...Oh.
Kyle
Aww, come on, you guys! It's supposed to be really cool.
Stan
Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
Cartman
[off-screen, but rushes in] You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
Kyle
What, doughboy?
Cartman
I was just- [looks stung, then flashes an angry look at Kyle] I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
Stan
So?
Cartman
So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
Kyle
What?
Cartman
No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
You'll never guess.
Stan
What?!
Cartman
Guess.
Kyle
Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
Cartman
You ready? [focus on Cartman] Tonight, on Cop Drama, on TV, they're gonna say, [looks both ways] "Shit."
Kyle
[gasps] They're gonna say "shit" on television?
Stan
They can't say "shit" on television!
Cartman
It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
Stan
Holy fucking shit!
Kenny
(Dude! We've gotta watch!)
Cartman
Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
Kyle
Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
Cartman
Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said "shit" on television!
Kyle
It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
Stan
Aw, come, on dude! This is history.
Kyle
It's stupid!
Cartman
Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
Kyle
No, I don't have sand in my vagina! I just think it's a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on TV!
Day, South Park Center for Seismic Activity, water cooler. Randy Marsh and three others shoot the breeze there
Randy
Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?
Sam
Yeah, they're gonna say "shit" on television.
Colleague 1
[balding man] Hey, we should all get together and watch it at the bar.
Colleague 2
[with light brown hair] Yeaaahhh!
Sam
Yeah.
Randy
Yeah.
Colleague 2
Are you guys gonna let your kids watch?
Randy
Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
Sam
And they're gonna say "shit"!
Day, sidewalk. Butters is tagging TELE's as Kyle walks up to him
Kyle
Hey, Butters! [Butters turns to see Kyle, and the tag is shown: "Butters"] I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite [points] YOU before anybody else.
Butters
Oh, sorry, I can't. [Kyle is disappointed] They're gonna say "shit" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
Kyle
How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
Mr. Garrison
[walks by] Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes! [people get in their cars and peel out of there, while those on the sidewalks quickly disperse. Only Kyle is left, bewildered]
Night, the town bar. Many of the town's men, including Randy and his coworkers, are inside watching "Cop Drama." The officers in the show speak in hushed tones.
Cop
[voice-over] Listen, Mitchell, I put my life on the line every day. How dare you accuse me!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes.
Mitchell
I'm doing my job, Frank! We have to know where that evidence was shipped!
Jimbo
Oh, was that it? Was that it?!
Randy
[annoyed] Shipped. He said "shipped".
Frank
I told you, we don't have a record of that. And besides, -
Cut to Cartman's house, night. Cartman sits on the sofa with Stan, Kyle and Kenny, and he's eating from a box of Cheesy Poofs
Frank
- your job is to protect the men who serve this force.
Cartman
Goddamn it! When are they gonna say "shit"?!
Stan
Sh!
Mitchell
Maybe... maybe protect them from you?
Cut to Chef's house, bedroom. He and Principal Victoria watch the show together in bed.
Frank
Maybe you're forgetting who you're talking to!
Mitchell
And maybe you're forgetting I used to be a cop, too!
Cut to the Broflovski house, living room. Sheila and Sharon are enjoying some popcorn as they view the show. Sheila is in the arnchair
Frank
Yeah? You used to be a lot of things.
Sheila
Oh, he doesn't know that Mitchell slept with his wife, does he?
Cut to the old folks home.
Mitchell
That's it, I've had enough of this.
Frank
Don't you turn your back on me, you!
Cut to New York's Times Square, in which a large crowd watches the show from behind a N.Y.P.D. police line
Mitchell
I said, enough!
Frank
Is it?
Cut back to Cartman's house.
Frank
Will it... ever be enough?
Announcer
Cop Drama will return after these messages.
Stan
Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say "shit?"
Cartman
I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
Stan and Kyle
Uh! [Kyle drops from the sofa and heads away]
Stan
Where are you going, Kyle?
Kyle
[stops and looks back] I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
Stan
But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say "shit" and you're gonna miss it!
Kyle
I don't really give a fuck! [turns and walks away]
Stan
Oh.
The bar, later.
Mitchell
Just understand that it's my job. I still think you're a good cop.
Frank
Well, Mitchell. I guess you're goin'ta do what you're gonna do. Let's just try and stay friends no matter what.
Mitchell
You're right. Maybe I'll see you around.
Frank
Goodbye. Oh, and Mitchell? [voice lowers to a whisper] You've got some shit on the side of your mouth right there.
Mitchell
Oh, yeah, thanks, thanks.
Bar Patrons
Wow!!!
Cartman's house...
The Boys
Whoa!!!
Chef's bedroom...
Chef and Principal Victoria
Oh!!
The old folks home...
Old Folks
Whoa!
Times Square... the crowd there cheers
The bar...
Jimbo
[awed] They did it!
Cartman's house...
Stan
I can't believe they actually said it. [Kyle returns with some food]
Cartman
Dude! You missed it, Kyle! It was so awesome!
Kyle
Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
Cartman
Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
Kyle
Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?! [moves from one end of the sofa to the other] Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world? [moves towards the front door] It's still the same old world out there. Look. [opens the door to find frogs raining down on the neighborhood. The other boys soon join him] What the hell?
Cartman
Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
Kyle
Oh, whatever. [steps back inside]
Channel 4 News
Anchor Tom
Last night, the daring and bold show, Cop Drama [title screen pops up], broke new ground by saying "Shit!" on television, making "shit" officially okay to say around the country. [poll picture pops up, and is filled in as the announcer continues] A recent poll shows that 24% of Americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far, while a whopping 76% say they don't really give a shit. [A Medical Alert pops up] In other news, a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community. [a field reporter stands before an ambulance and a barn] Rick Watts has the story.
Rick Watts
Thanks, Tom. Shit is certainly going down here in the small town- [begins to vomit strenuously, then falls over dead]
Tom
Whoa, shit!
South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings
Ms. Choksondik
Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I'm s'posed to clarify the school's position on the word, "shit".
Stan
Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!
Kyle
This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it's alright.
Ms. Choksondik
Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form.
Cartman
[quizzically] Huh?
Ms. Choksondik
You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance, [turns and writes on the board] "That's a shitty picture of me." is now fine. Hoever, the literal noun form of [writes] "This is a picture of shit." is still naughty. [crosses out the sentence]
Cartman
I don't get it.
Stan
Me neither.
Ms. Choksondik
The adjective form is now also acceptable. For example: [writes] "The weather outside is shitty." However, the literal adjective is not appropriate. For example: [writes] "My bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty, and I had to clean it with a rag, which then also became shitty." [crosses it out] That's right out!
Timmy
Sss...sss...[draws it out] shit. [grins]
Ms. Choksondik
Very good, Timmy.
Butters
[raises his hand] Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, "Oh, shit," or, "shit on a shingle"?
Ms. Choksondik
Yes, that's now fine.
Cartman
Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
Kyle
[angrily] It's not new!! I'm gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
Cartman
Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
Kyle
There's no sand in my vagina!!!
Ms. Choksondik
[pointing] Boys, watch your language! Shit!
Kindergarten, day
Mr. Garrison
And so, children, instead of saying "Hand in your papers," I may now say, "Hand in your shit." Any questions?
Filmore
What about, "I have to take a shit"?
Mr. Garrison
No! No, Filmore! You can say "I have to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have to poop," but not "I have to shit." Are we all clear?
Kindergartners
No.
Mr. Garrison
Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, "fag". On television they usually don't allow "fag". But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, "shit," that means that finally I am free to say,

Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?
Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?

[pleased] Oh this is great!

South Park, some days later. The town has taken to using the S word, with Shit-themed stores and products all over the place. People proudly sport the word on their shirts. An elderly couple walks out of Shit 'n Things and stop just outside the door
Elderly Woman
Why that store has such lovely shit.
Elderly Man
Yeah. [they walk forth] Too bad I don't have shit for cash right now. [camera pans to the right and shows Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey.]
Principal Victoria
Oh, looks like the weather might turn shitty.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit.
Man
Shit, Peter, you look like shit.
Peter
No, shit, I feel like shit. I think I-[begins to vomit strenuously, then falls over dead as people gather to see what's the matter]
Woman 1
Holy shit!
Woman 2
Did you see that shit? [Officer Barbrady arrives]
Barbrady
What kind of shit is this?
Man 1
That is some weird shit. [camera pans up into the sky. Voice-overs from here on]
Woman 3
Susan, your shit's ready!
Man 2
Do you know where this shit goes? [cut to a shot of the U.S. with Colorado highlighted. Smoke pours up from cities everywhere]
Man 3
Shit if I know.
Woman 4
Nice going, shit-for-brains.
a high mountain is shown
Man 4
Old McDonald took a shit, E I E I O
Man 5
No shit!
seven knights are shown encased in ice. The smoke reaches them and thaws them out. Music swells. They step forth and walk to the edge of a cliff, looking out over all those towns and cities spewing forth the filthy word. They draw their swords and raise them high, and lightning strikes each of the swords
South Park, another day. Mr. Garrisn is walking down the street, singing.
Mr. Garrison
Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,
Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?
Hey, there,-
Man 6
[bumps into Garrison] Oh, shit, 'scuse me. [walks away]
Mr. Garrison
Hey, watch it, fag.
Man 6
[stops and backs up] What did you call me?
Mr. Garrison
I called you a fag. Because I'm gay, and that means I'm free to use the word "fag". So piss off, you fag-shitter! [laughs and walks away]
Heh, so hey there, shity shitty fag fag
Shitty shitty fag fag, ba doop a doop doo [walks past Stan and Cartman. Cartman is sucking on a Popsicle]
Stan
This sucks. Now that "shit"'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
Cartman
Yeah, they've taken all the fun out of "shit". We're gonna have to start saying other bad words, like cock and fuck and... meecrob. [licks his Popsicle]
Stan
What's meecrob?
Cartman
You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than "shit", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. [Kyle rushes in with Kenny behind him]
Kyle
You guys! You guys! I've looked up the word, "shit"! I think it might have something to do with people dying!
Stan
What?
Kyle
Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said "shit" on television.
Cartman
[dismissive] Oh, Kyle, you are so full of meecrob.
Kyle
I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word "shit" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
Stan
What's that?
Cartman
Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
Kyle
Look! It might be a coincidence, but I think we'd better ask someone. Come on! [They walk past Shit Shack, and one of the knights steps out of the store as they leave. He sniffs a teal shirt with the word "shit" in his right hand.]
Hollywood, day, the HBC building. The network president talks to his staff in a boardroom. They're all smiling
HBC President
...Seventy-five share. My God, I never thought it was possible.
Director 1
[brown hair and tie] Sir, your "shit" idea has turned the entire network around. We're proud to work for you. [all clap]
Director 2
[a blond] Sir, I'd just like to take this opportunity: And, I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say, you are the most creative genius in Hollywood, and... well... I'd let you have me if you wanted.
HBC President
Thanks, Roger, but I've only just started. You see, I've already figured out our new marketing scheme technique for the next run of shows.
Director 3
Whoa!
Director 4
He's unstoppable!
Director 1
What's the new idea?
Director 3
I can hardly wait.
Director 5
I'm about to piss myself!
HBC President
[dramatic. Music swells] This Saturday... on HBC... we're going to say... [music stops] "shit" ...twice.
Director 3
[pauses] Twice!
Director 4
Brilliant!
Director 6
Think of the repetition!
Director 3
It's like saying it once... but double!
HBC President
Well gentlemen, let's get on it!
All
Ho! [they raise their arms up in salute]
South Park Elementary, day. Chef is singing away in the kitchen, serving up lunch for the kids.
Chef
Baby you are so fine, and shit!
The shit you do, the shit you say; I'd jump on your shit any day!
[the boys walk in] Oh, hello there, children.
The Boys
Hey Chef.
Kyle
Chef, do you know where "shit" comes from?
Chef
Uh, from your ass, children.
Kyle
[holds his left palm out] No no! The word, "shit".
Chef
Oh.
Cartman
[points to Kyle] Detective Sandy Vagina here [Kyle looks angrily at Cartman] thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
Kyle
Ungh, it said in my book that the word, "shit", started exactly the same time as something called, "The Black Death".
Chef
The Black Death? Are you sure?
Stan
What's the Black Death, Chef?
Chef
LaToya Jackson, children.
The Boys
Oh.
Chef
But I think back in those days it meant something else: the plague!
The Library, later. Chef reads from a large book on a large table on the ground floor. To his left sit Stan and Kenny, to his right Kyle and Cartman
Chef
It says here the word, "shit" has been around for over 600 years. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon word, "skite".
Kyle
Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit." The same year as the Black Plague.
Librarian
[walks up with a cart of books] This is the oldest book in the library. [stops and holds up the book] A priceless original of England's history. Just about everything you could want to know about the plague is in this great tome. [blows the dust off the book, and the book disappears in the dust] Oh, shit. Well, this other book has some good information, too. [hands Chef the book and Chef cracks it open. Music starts]
Chef
The Black Plague. Over half of Europe was killed by it.
Stan
Look, they're puking out their intestines, just like the people here. [points]
Chef
Look at this, children. [the boys look closer] It says that the people in England believed that the plague was a curse, a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse.
Stan
Word of curse?
Kyle
A... curse word.
Chef
Of course! I've never even thought about why we use the term "curse word" before.
Stan
Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
Cartman
You guys, look here. [the others move over to see] In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
Kyle
Cartman, this is serious!!!
Cartman
So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. [laughs]
Librarian
[returns] If you don't mind, I'll have to close up now. They're going to say "shit" seven times on HBC and I- [begins to vomit strenuously, then falls over dead]
Stan
Holy shit!
Cartman
Oh-Ho, gross!
Kyle
Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! [Kenny goes under the weather and coughs. The others look]
Stan
Uh oh.
Kenny
(Uh oh.)
Cartman
Kenny's got it. heh heh.
Kyle
We've gotta do something, Chef. If we don't we don't stop that network, [the lead knight looks into the library from the bushes] "shit" will become an even more acceptable word!
Chef
Children, we've got to warn those producers in Hollywood that the plague, and "shit", could be linked!
An airplane, day. Chef and the boys are headed for Hollywood
Captain
Hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit. [all look right, except Chef and Kenny] And over on the left side, there's some interesting shit, too. [all look left, except Chef and Kenny] Well, we should be arriving in Los Angeles in about two hours. Until then we invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy our shitty service. [Kenny coughs at Cartman]
Cartman
[brushes himself off] Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
Kyle
Cartman, stop being an asshole! [camera pans left to the lead knight sitting between two men, reading from THE WORLD NEWS. The knight lowers the paper and looks over at the boys, then sips from his coffee cup]
HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, boardroom.
Director 5
Tha ratings are in, sir. We broke another record last night with the show that said "shit" seven times! [applause]
Director 1
Where is the roof on this thing? I mean, I mean, how can we top ourselves now? [the president walks behind him en route to the head of the table, then sits down]
HBC President
Gentlemen, I have it. The end-all greatest marketing ploy of all time. [applause] Tonight, on HBC, we will air all our sitcoms... LIVE. And have everyone say "shit" in place of their written lines. And we'll call it "Must Shit TV".
Director 1
Bravo!
Director 2
"Night Of A Million Shits!"
HBC President
Now, doing this live will be difficult, so we must- [Chef and the boys burst through the doors]
Chef
Hold on a minute, Mr. Producer!
HBC President
Who are you?
Chef
My name is Chef, and these are the children! We've come to warn you about "shit".
HBC President
[wearily] Oh brother, another Christian protest group.
Director 1
Who wants to take this one?
Director 2
I'll get it. [rises and walks over to the guests, with a box of complimentary gifts] Gentlemen, we appreciate your concern. [starts speaking quickly as he hands out beanie turtles, caps, American flags, and T-shirts. Kenny's eyes are bloodshot now] Here at HBC the general goal is providing the highest and most thought-provoking netertainment. How great it is that we live in a country where an artist can express himself freely. That's not only the American spirit, it's the HBC spirit. Which allows us to make great family programs like Halo The Turtle, and of course, everyone's favorite show, Cop Drama. We can't thank you enough for bringing your concerns to our network, for it is you, the loyal HBC viewer, who makes this great network, and indeed, the great country that it is. [finishes his speech with some confetti, then returns to his chair]
HBC President
Alright, now, as I was saying-
Chef
Hey! Hold on a minute!
HBC President
Aw, are they stil here?
Chef
Haven't you people noticed all the strange things going on?
Kyle
We think that you might have could it by helping make "shit" an everyday word. [the executives just stare back at him]
Director 4
Hm, right, right.
Kyle
It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
HBC President
Do you have any proof of this?
Kyle
...No.
HBC President
Then [rises] get out of here before we have you thrown out!
Cartman
But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?
HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, outside. Chef and the boys exit the building.
Chef
[defiant] Damn cracker-ass producers!
Stan
Now what are we gonna do, Chef?
Chef
I don't know, children. I guess we've got to get the word out to people some other way.
Lead Knight
[arrives, and brandishes his sword] Aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh.
Stan
Oh shit!
Lead Knight
Stand aside! [the boys make way for him, and he rushes into the building]
HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, boardroom.
HBC President
Alright, now, we have to get all our biggest names to say "shit", and then we're gonna- [the knight bursts into the room]
Lead Knight
Halt your evil plans!
Executives
Huh?
Lead Knight
I possess the Rune Stone of Undoing! Who is in charge here? [all the directors point to the president]
HBC President
Oh... [buries his face in his hands, believing his staff did something special for him] No, you guys didn't hire me a stripper for my birthday- oh, tell me you guys didn't.
Lead Knight
Show your true form, Geldon, lest you be afraid! Your short time in this world is at an end! [aims the Rune Stone at the president, but nothing happens. The directors just look at him.] Ach. The Rune Stone has no effect! You are not Geldon!
HBC President
I never said I was.
Lead Knight
[wields his sword and rushes towards the president] You will die anyway, for you have spread the word of curse! [decapitates a director]
HBC President
Security! [two officers come in with guns drawn and fire away at the knight]
Lead Knight
Ach! [the gunfire forces him out a window, and he falls to the ground five floors below] oh.
HBC headquarters, Hollywood, day, outside. Chef and the boys approach the fallen knight.
Chef
Who are you?
Lead Knight
Take this. [reaches out, and gives Stan the stone.]
Stan
What are we supposed to do with it?
Lead Knight
Eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. [expires]
Kyle
Now what?
Chef
We've got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about. Children, we're goin' to have to go to the land of castles, knights, and kings!
Las Vegas, sunset, a view of the Strip, showing many of the attractions that can be found there.
Announcer
[as Chef and the boys take a people-mover in] Lords and Ladies, we bid you welcome to the grandest casino in the land, Excalibur! [a shot of the casino inside, with craps table, one-armed bandits, etc.]
Barker
Take a free spin. Double your odds. [Chef and the boys approach]
Chef
'Scuse me. Do you work here?
Barker
How can I help you, noble sir?
Kyle
We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
Barker
A what?
Stan
It might hold the key to a curse.
Barker
Uh... I can help get you some credit or a comp meal, perhaps.
Stan
Dude, we need help from the British!
Barker
Look kid, This is just a casino. I can't help you. You know, not every British person knows about wizards [begins chuckling] and dragons and curses.
Chef
We just need help identifying this. [holds up the stone]
Barker
[suddenly concerned, with hushed tones] The Rune Stome of Gaelic! Where did you get this?
Stan
You know what it is?
Barker
The Skire once spoke of such a stone! Come, we must see the sorcerer! [leads Chef and the boys off]
South Park, bar, night. The men are gathered there once again
Announcer
Get ready for "Must Shit TV"! Starting now, four straight hours of pure shit! It's all live!
On the set of the Drew Carey show. Drew and Mimi are onstage, with Drew sitting at his desk
Drew
Hey! Heh, shit! Heh. [studio audience laughs] Ya ain't shit.
Mimi
Yeah. Dude, ya ain't shit! [more laughs]
HBC President
This is it. My greatest work.
Excalibur, inside. The barker leads Chef and the boys down a hall and run into a waitress dressed as a damsel
Waitress
Cocktails. Cocktails.
Barker
These Americans wish to see the Skire!
Waitress
Let us make haste to the inner sanctum!
Excalibur, the hallway to the Inner Sanctum. The barker and waitress lead Chef and the boys through
Barker
How could you foolish Americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness?!
Chef
Uh, yeah. We didn't mean to.
Barker
Didn't you realize "shit" is a curse word?!
Stan
Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew "curse word" meant... curse word.
Barker
Ha! Leave it to Americans to think that "no" means yes, "pissed" means angry, and "curse word" means something other than a word that's cursed!!
The Inner Sanctum. The group enters and walks towards the sorcerer
Sorcerer
Let me see the stone. [takes it and walks off to his right]
Chef
But I don't get it. People use curse words all the time.
Barker
Saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing. It's only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place.
Sorcerer
[now seated at a table with a book of runes open] I've seen this before. Stones that were used by the Knights of Standards and Practices.
Chef
Knights of Standards and Practices?
Sorcerer
A legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay. But... they were just a myth.
South Park, bar, night. The men watch the Drew Carey Show
Mimi
You know what? You're dumb as shit!
Drew
Oh yeah?! Well, I don't really give a shit!
Randy
Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.
Man 7
Yeah, they're gonna have to come up with a new swear word soon.
Mr. Garrison
Well, they can't use "fag". Because you can't say "fag" unless you're a homosexual.
Randy
Really? So we can't say ***?
Mr. Garrison
No. See, you got beeped.
Man 7
You mean you have to be a *** to say ***?
Mr. Garrison
That's right.
Jimbo
Well, that's not fair! I should be able to say "fag". [realizes he wasn't beeped]
Randy
...Hey, you didn't get beeped.
Jimbo
Uh oh.
Mr. Garrison
Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag! You wanna make out or something?
Drew
[shown] Oh, man, I am up shit creek.
On the set of the Drew Carey show. The door to stage C opens and in gallop the knights with swords drawn
Mimi
Serves you right, shit-for-brains!
Drew
Yeah, how could I be such a dumb sh-
Lead Knight
Say not the word of curse! [throws his sword at Drew. The sword enters through Drew's mouth and out the left side of his head. The handle forces him off his chair and onto a cubicle wall]
HBC President
What the?
Mimi
[rushing in] Holy shit! [another knight chops Mimi's head off from behind]
South Park, bar, night. The men watch the Drew Carey Show
Mr. Garrison
Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!
Excalibur, the Inner Sanctum. The Sorcerer continues with the mythology of the knights.
Sorcerer
The knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum. Should a curse word ever be let out, they would return. A rune for each word of curse was made, representing each of the eight words that so offended God...
Stan
Look, there's the F-word.
Kyle
And asshole.
Cartman
I knew it! Meecrob! [the word is shown in close-up] Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
Sorcerer
Look at this: The writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil Geldon [the page he reads from show a dragon], who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power. Then all the world will be destroyed.
Stan
All the world destroyed?
Cartman
My house, too?
Chef
Oh no!
Sorcerer
What?
Chef
Tonight is the "Night of a Million Shits" on HBC! It's gonna be said over and over!
Sorcerer
Then we haven't much time. We must go!
On the set of the Drew Carey show. The blond knight approaches the cameraman
Blond Knight
Turn off those devices of broadcast!
HBC President
What is going on here?! Stop this shit!
Blond Knight
We are the Royal Order of Standards and Practices! [a bald knight joins him]
Bald Knight
We command you to stop saying the curse word!
HBC President
Listen, Mr. Shinypants, I am the head of this network, and I will say "shit" all I want! Shit, shit, shit shit shit, shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit, [gasp. A rumble is heard], shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit! [stops. The rumble gets very loud and the ground begins to heave, as if an earthquake is occuring. The ground splits open and the Geldon rises from it. The audience screams as the Geldon breathes real fire out at them.]
Oh, shit!
South Park, bar, night. The TV screen is show, with the HBC logo.
Announcer
And now, back to Must Shit TV, here on HBC.
On the set of the Drew Carey show. The terror continues - the knights fight the geldon valiantly.
Lead Knight
He is too strong! We cannot fight him without the rune stone!
Director 1
My, my GOD, sir! What have you unleashed upon the world?!
HBC President
I didn't know. [begins to weep into his hands] I didn't know!!!
South Park, bar, night. The men watch in increasing disbelief
Randy
I, I can't follow this shitty storyline at all.
On the set of the Drew Carey show. The terror continues, but Chef and the boys arrive
Kyle
Wait! [the Geldon lets loose another blast of fire]
Cartman
[as the geldon sets more fires] Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! [one knight's horse's tail is on fire.]
Lead Knight
The rune stone! Point it towards Geldon! [Kyle does as ordered, and a flash of light emanates from the rune stone, stunning the Geldon]
Geldon
Agh. Dude, lame. Lame! [the ground opens up again and the geldon drops down into the hole] Bummer, dudes. [the ground closes up again]
Cartman
What a stupid voice.
Kyle
It's okay. The curse has been lifted. [the audience falls silent. Kyle and Stan are on stage.]
Stan
Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
Kyle
You see, we've learned something today. Swearing can be fun, but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems.
Cut to Kyle's home, where he's on TV
Kyle
We're all saying the S-word too much! [Ike hops in]
Ike
Kyle.
Sheila
[on the sofa with Gerald] Look, Gerald. Kyle's on television! [she's sewing as he reads the paper]
Gerald
[doesn't look up] Uh huh.
Cut to the old folks' home
Kyle
The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. "Curse words" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
Stan
And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
Cartman
[camera cuts to him] So please, everyone, From now on you've got to try and watch your language. [murmurs and a smattering of applause come from the audience.]
South Park, bar, night. The men think over the boys' message
The men
[one by one] Yeah.
Randy
That makes sense.
Colleague 1
Ain't that right?
Mr. Garrison
Is this still part of the show?
On the set of the Drew Carey show. The place is calm now.
HBC President
We're sorry, noble knights of Standards and Practices. [the knights and the executives approach each other] From now on, we will obey your laws.
Blond Knight
See that you do!
Chef
I'm very proud of you, children. Let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.
Stan
Yeah! And Kenny didn't die!
Kenny
(Yeah, I didn't- [he kneels over, his intestines pouring out over the sound stage]
Stan
Holy shi- [quickly taps his mouth with his hands and releases] poop.
Cartman
Hah, I love you guys.
End of It Hits the Fan

Cripple Fight
South park, night. Randy is driving the boys, including Timmy on the truck bed, through the town. Stuart is with them, but Kyle is not. The boys are in Scout gear.
Randy
Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.
Stan
It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Stuart
Well, now, that's part of the fun.
Randy
Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
Stan
Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. [all but Cartman laugh]
Cartman
That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
Stan
[calling to the back] Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
Timmy
Hyeah Timmay!
Cartman
Yeah, he's excited.
Park County Community Center, night, outside shot, then inside shot. The doors open and the group walks in. A shot of the many kids inside, then back to the doors. Butters walks up.
Butters
Hey, fellas!
Cartman
[flatly] Hey, Butters.
Butters
Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
Randy
Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.
Stuart
You boys just make sure to obey the scout leader now. He's the man in charge.
Big Gay Al
[suddenly steps in] Hello scouts!
Stan
Hey, it's Big Gay Al!
Big Gay Al
Hello, Stanley. I was happy to see you and your little friends' names on the list!
Timmy
Timmay!
Randy
You're the new scout leader?
Big Gay Al
[walks around the boys and stops behind the dads, hugging them] I just got transferred in. [lets go of the dads and moves further into the room] I think everyone's here now, so we can get started. [stops] Come on, Scouts. We've got work to do! [moves again]
Boys
Hooray! [they start moving, too]
Stan
See ya, Dad!
Community Center gymnasium. Three tables are set for the scouts to sit at. Big Gay Al walks up to his chair at the center table. Stan, Cartman, Kenny, and Timmy find empty spots on the outside of the table to the left. A small banner hangs from the center table: TROOP 69
Big Gay Al
Hey, are you parents gonna stand there all night? This meeting is for scouts only, you silly gooses. [Randy and Stuart look on a bit longer, then turn around and walk out. Close-up on the table reveals four older scouts, two on either side of Big Gay Al] Now, before we get started, scouts, I want to introduce you to someone very special here tonight. He's a brave little boy with disabilities who proves just by being here that Scouts are for everyone!
Timmy
[happily] Timmay!
Big Gay Al
So let's all give a big round of applause to little... Jimmy! [points to his right. Jimmy walks up using his crutches.]
Jimmy Valmer
Well hello everyone. [applause]
Timmy
Ji- Jimmay?
The bar, nearby. There's some argument going on inside
Stuart
Look! I'm not saying the new scout leader's a bad person, I just don't think he should be a scout leader!
Randy
He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
Stephen
Well how gay is he?
Stuart
He's really, really gay.
Token's father
Well then, I don't want my boy there, either. [more argument ensues]
Randy
So he's a homosexual. So what?
Stuart
I have nothing against homosexuals either, Randy, but the big camping trip is next week! Are you sayin' you're fine with this guy campin' overnight, alone, with our boys??
Skeeter
You know, boys emulate authority figures. Even if it doesn't turn them gay, they could end up all talk and all fem' and prancin' around like girls. [more argument]
Randy
Aw, that's ridiculous.
Priest Maxi
[walks in] People, people, please! You're forgetting that homosexuality is a choice! As many of you know, I, myself, went through a... homosexual... phase. But the light of Christ showed me how to change. Just give me two hours with this man, and I can convert him back.
Man
[voice only] That's what you said about Peterson, and then you ended up having sex with him!
Man 2
[voice only] That's right.
Man 3
[voice only] You did.
Community Center gymnasium. The Scouts are well into their first activities
Big Gay Al
And so that's how to make banana-nut muffins. And now, as a very special treat, our very special friend Jimmy is going to do what he loves most: Motivational standup comedy. [Jimmy walks into view] Let's give him a big hand. [applause]
Jimmy
Wow, what a great audience. [applause dies down] Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B. [the other kids laugh] You guys like im- personations? [applause]
Timmy
[displeased] Timmy.
Jimmy
How about Jimmy Stewart? "Merry Christmas, movie house." And John Travolta. "Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!"
Stan
Jimmy's funny, dude.
Butters
Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
Timmy
[gets angry and crosses his arms] Hmph! [the doors open and in walk Randy and Stuart]
Stuart
Uh, Kenny, it's nine o'clock.
Randy
Come on, Stanley.
Big Gay Al
Oops, guess we're out of time, kids. Now remember, tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money. We'll meet back here next Tuesday, and see who raised the most. Good luck.
Stan
Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
Cartman
Hey, yeah!
Timmy
[brushing off the idea] Timmuh Timmy Timmy Timmy. [camera pulls back to show Jimmy walking up]
Stan
Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
Jimmy
Gee, sure, that'd be great! Thanks, fellas.
Randy
[the other scouts leave] Come on, Stan.
Stan
Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
Kenny
(Yeah, see ya.)
Stan, Cartman
Bye, Jimmy.
Jimmy
See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas.
Randy's truck, night. Randy is taking the boys home.
Stan
You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Stan
We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
Cartman
Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
Stan
And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
Timmy
[outside, visibly upset] Yahahah!!!
Cartman
Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
Stan
Cartman, don't say "use him", you big silly goose. [Randy bears down on the brakes, causing Timmy to roll backwards and into the back window]
Timmy
Ah.
Randy
[to Stan] What did you say?!
Stan
[a bit softly, eyes fixed on his fater] I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
Stuart
Uh huh!
Randy
You do not say "Big silly goose"! You call him an asshole like a normal kid!
Stan
Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-
Randy
Stanley, you call your friend an asshole this instant!
Stan
[glances at Cartman] ...Asshole. [looks at Randy again]
Randy
That's better.
Cartman
Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.
South Park, next day, Camera pulls back to show a booth next to a stage. On the booth is a banner: "Mountain Scout Bake Sale," and Timmy, Kenny, Cartman, and Butters are manning the booth. Items for sale: cookies, cakes, and donuts. Butters mans the collection box. People walk by this way and that. On stage, Stan prepares to speak.
Stan
Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! [Jimmy walks up on crutches to the mic and begins]
Jimmy
Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired! [male laughter] What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, "Are you angry at God for making disabled people?" I say, "No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush." [laughter]
Sharon
[heartfelt] What a brave little boy.
Sheila
He's able to use comedy to overcome his handicap! I love him! [Timmy, upset, sighs and crosses his arms]
Jimmy
Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park. [more people gather] H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? "Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!" [more laughter]
Cartman
Hehe, I don't sound like that.
Jimmy
And how about that school counselor? "Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad." [Mackey happily nudges a man to his right] "Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?" [Timmy is stewing in his anger] Wow, what a great audience. "Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-" [Garrison grins] "Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat" [more laughter] "I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch." [Chef looks flattered] "Salisbury steak for lunch." Eh. Uh. "Goddamnit, Goddamnit!" [more, stronger laughter and applause] And of course, my very favorite, "Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!" [the laughter and applause get louder, and Timmy gets livid] "Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy." Heh. Sometimes it's like, "Please, Timmy, learn a new word," heh. "Timmy! Tu-Timmy!" [more laughter]
Timmy
[angrily] Aaaaaaah! [Stan notices. Quickly, Timmy takes a cake half and throws it right at Jimmy, and it hits. Jimmy leans to his left, and stabilizes himself]
Jimmy
Wow, looks like when it comes to comedy, I really t-take the c-keh-c. I really take the cay. I really take the k-keh cake. [cheers and claps abound]
Man
Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my! Jim-my
Timmy
[wailing] Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!
State Mountain Scouts of America headquarters, day, outside shot. Inside, three men sit behind a table - a tribunal.
Head Scoutmaster
Well, this is it. We've simply gotten too many complaints from concerned parents about him. I'm afraid we don't have a choice.
Big Gay Al
[enters the room] Hi ya fellas! [waves his left arm quickly]
Head Scoutmaster
How are you today, Scout?
Big Gay Al
I'm super, thanks for asking. The troops are off having bake sales, and I'm pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event. Yippie!
Head Scoutmaster
Uh, Big Gay Al, it's recently come to our attention that you are... gay.
Big Gay Al
Well, stop the presses. Did you figure that out all by yourselves, silly buns?
Scoutmaster 1
Yes, well, unfortunately for you, the Scouts have a policy that openly gay men cannot belong.
Head Scoutmaster
We are left with no options, Mr. Al. I'm afraid you are hereby... out of Scouts.
Big Gay Al
[Softly. Somber music plays.] Out of... Scouts?
Head Scoutmaster
We're sorry, Mr. Gay Al.
Big Gay Al
But I've been in Scouts since I was nine - it's a... huge part of my life.
Scoutmaster 2
Uh, you must understand that Scouts is a private club. A club that follows certain beliefs, and one of those beliefs is that homosexuality is immoral.
Big Gay Al
I see...
Head Scoutmaster
It's nothing against you personally
Big Gay Al
What if I promise not to be gay anymore? [holds up a pinky] Pinky swear.
Scoutmaster 2
We think it's best you just... move on.
Big Gay Al
[rejected] Right. Move on. [turns around, sighs, and walks out]
South Park streets, day. Timmy sits on the sidewalk as Jimmy ambles towards him.
Jimmy
Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet.
Timmy
[holding a gift] Timmih.
Jimmy
What's that?
Timmy
Hur livin' a lah, Timmih. [presents the gift]
Jimmy
A present? You got me a p-present?
Timmy
Timmih!
Jimmy
...[takes the gift] Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent. [opens the present] If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh? [pulls out the contents] Wow, a parka. [an orange one] You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim.
Timmy
[all smiles] Tim-Timmy.
Jimmy
Oh, sure. I'll see if it fits. [Timmy grins with anticipation as Jimmy dons the parka. Next shot is of Jimmy looking suspiciously like Kenny] This is very warm. Thanks a lot, Tim-Tim. Well, I'll see you around. [turns around to walk away]
Timmy
Timmih! [grins]
As Jimmy walks, suspense music comes up. Jimmy reaches the corner, and a safe falls from above and cracks the sidewalk behind him. He crosses the street, and a truck plows into an oncoming car and jackknifes, sending the car backwards through the air. Jimmy is untouched. An eagle tries to swoop him up, but misses. Jimbo and Ned appear atop a building across the street
Jimbo
There he is! Kill him! Kill him! [Ned fires three times] Oh, wait, that's not him. [the two men withdraw, and Jimmy keeps walking]
Some glass blows out from a window next to Jimmy, followed by a blast of fire, and Jimmy walks. He crosses the second street and a herd of cattle stampede past him. He continues down the road, and a space shuttle crashes into the sidewalk, nose first.
Jimmy
[calling back] Thanks again, Tim-Tim.
Timmy
[thwarted] Tim-Timmay!
Big Gay Al's house, night. Quite colorful front lawn, with fountain, flowers, a flower strip down the middle of the driveway. Soft music plays. Inside, Al sits on his bed looking over framed photos of his Scouting career. Scout Troop 417 - 1988, Camp White Swallow - 1974, his Scout medals, a picture of a black man dresed as Superman. Al sighs and looks over at his Scout uniform. He walks over and takes it down, then walk to his dresser and puts the uniform away in one of its drawers
Big Gay Al
Ah, bye, Scouts. [closes the drawer. The camera pans to show a man playing a piano] Okay, okay, Marc, stop playing now.
Marc
Hey, don't yell at me! Ya asked me to come over and play sad songs for you to pack to, and then ya yell at me.
Big Gay Al
[approaching] I'm sorry. Sorry. But now I've packed everything away, so just... well, play something uplifting, like... "I'm gonna put all this behind me and make it okay" music.
Marc
[starts playing sprightly music] Ooooh, I don't want her. You can have her. She's too fat for me.
Big Gay Al
Oh! [buries his face in his left hand] Jesus, Marc.
Park County Community Center, night. A group of men stand outside. The head Scoutmaster exits the building with a big, beefy, decorated Scout leader
Head Scoutmaster
Parents, this is the new Scout leader, Mr. Grazier. He will be taking over for the homosexual.
Randy
Nice to meet you.
Mr. Grazier
Marsh, right? We actually kind of know each other. Your wife and mine are friends.
Stuart
Your wife, huh?
Head Scoutmaster
Carol is the head of a girls' Mountain Scouts troop.
Randy
[nudges Stuart, who then smiles] Well, I guess we're off to the bar until nine, then.
Mr. Grazier
Gonna go pound some brews, huh?
Inside, Jimmy entertains the troops with more of his comedy skit as the men talk outside
Jimmy
And so I said to him, "Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf." [the other scouts laugh] Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?
Timmy
[resisting] Timmay.
Jimmy
Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim. [the boys laugh, and Jimmy approaches] Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too. [laughter. Timmy gets angry when Jimmy offers him a Dr. Seuss-like hat.] Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat. [Timmy throws the hat down. Jimmy picks it back up and offers it again.] Just for a second, Timmy. [Timmy throws the hat back at him, an dhe picks it up again] Don't be a jerk, Timmy. [approaches with the hat, but Timmy smacks him away] Hey, don't push me!
Timmy
Timmih! [turns his chair to face Jimmy directly]
Cartman
Cripple fight! [the other boys cheer, but Mr. Grazier bursts through the doors]
Mr. Grazier
That is enough, Scouts! Take your seats! [the boys turn left and go to their seats]
Cartman
Awww!
Mr. Grazier
Alright, Scouts, I am your new Scout Master, Mr. Grazier! [paces back and forth between tables] Together we are going to become the best! The sleekest! The most polished Scout troop in all of Colorado! Isn't that right! [there's no answer] When I ask you a question you will answer "Yes, Scoutmaster!" Do I make myself clear?!
Scouts
Yes, Scoutmaster!
Mr. Grazier
Good! Now, the first activity for this evening will be... [hushed] naked pictures [brings forth a camera] I'm going to take some pictures of each of you naked, in case we need them, for later.
Scouts
Awww.
Mr. Grazier
Aw, what is this?! If there's one thing I hate, it's a whining platoon! "We don't wanna do pushups! We don't wanna get up early! We don't wanna have you take naked pictures of us!"
Cartman
[to Kenny] Man, this guy sucks.
Mr. Grazier
Now, fall in and strip down, Scouts!
Community Center gym, later. The pictures have been taken and the Scouts are dressed and at table.
Mr. Grazier
Alright, Scouts, we're gonna end this meeting with a little puppet show. [pulls out a smiling Scout hand puppet] Here's a little Scout. He's always prepared. He's always ready. Now, here's a little Scout telling his parents that Mr. Grazier took naked pictures of him. Look what happens. [pulls out a hammer with his left hand and whacks away at the puppet on his right hand. The Scouts are frightened] Oh! No! Aw! Aw! Aw! [his right hand is bleeding, leaving a small pool of blood under the puppet] Do I make myself clear, Scouts?!
Scouts
Yes, Scoutmaster! [the parents enter to pick up their boys]
Mr. Grazier
[now hiding his right hand] Oh, hello parents. Alright, that's all the time we have for tonight, Scouts. We sure had a great time, didn't we?
Scouts
Yes sir Scoutmaster! [the troops break and go to their parents. Mr. Grazier walks over to Randy and Stuart, with his right hand behnd his back]
Randy
Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.
Stuart
Yeah. Now they're acting like men.
Mr. Grazier
Well, you know what I say about kids: They're all pink on the inside.
Randy
You bet.
Stuart
I heard that.
Randy
See ya, Mr. Grazier. [Randy and Stuart walk out. Mr. Grazier waits till they're gone and then pulls out the pictures he'd just taken and reviews them]
Big Gay Al's house, night, living room. Al is on the couch unkempt, covered in a blanket, watching TV, and devouring ice cream. The door bell rings
Big Gay Al
Go away! I'm dead! [the door closes, and soon the South Park troop comes into view and stands in front of him]
Butters
Oh, well, here he is.
Stan
Big Gay Al, what are you doing?!
Cartman
Yeah! Get your big gay ass off the couch and come be our scoutmaster again!
Big Gay Al
I can't, kids. I've been... kicked out of Scouts.
Stan
Kicked out? Oh no!
Cartman
But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
Big Gay Al
Really? wull-why?
Butters
[pause. Stan and Cartman look to him] We can't tell you.
Big Gay Al
Why not?
Butters
[approaches the kidney-shaped table and demonstrates] Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! [Al is shocked at the implication]
Stan
Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
Big Gay Al
Boys, there's nothing I can do. The Scouts don't allow homosexuals.
Jimmy
Well then that settles it! Fellas, what we're gonna hafta do is try to ch... change the Scouts' rules, very much.
South Park streets, day. The six boys are picketing on the sidewalk. Cartman carries a picket: "Scouting is for everyone!" Butters and Kenny carry a fold-up table between them
Stan
What do we want?
Boys
Gays in Scouts!
Stan
When do we want it?
Timmy
Timmih!
Stan
What do we want?
Boys
Gays in Scouts!
Stan
When do we want it?
Timmy
Timmih!
Stan
What do we want?
Randy
[slowly, as the boys and Stan continue] Oh, no.
Boys
Gays in Scouts!
Stan
When do we want it?
Timmy
Timmih!
South Park streets, day, further down the street. The six boys continue picketing.
Stan
What do we want?
Boys
Gays in Scouts!
Stan
When do we want it?
Timmy
Timmih! [the boys approach Henry's Supermarket]
Stan
Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. [a little girl stands at the market's entrance]
Little Girl
Puppies. Puppies for sale.
Cartman
[moves over to her] Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! [takes her box and looks inside, then tosses it away. She goes after the box]
Stan
Alright, let's set up. [the table's legs come down and Cartman's picket is hung in front of the table. A mic and sound system are set up next to the table. A customer exits the market, and Stan whips out a petition board] Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays? [the customer gets away, but another one comes] Uh, hello, gays in Scouts? [the customers ignore him] Goddamnit! [All the while Timmy looks down angrily at Jimmy]
Butters
Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
Stan
That's a great idea! [takes the mic] Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
Jimmy
[takes the mic] Wow, what a great audience. For my first joke, I'm going to need a... volunteer. Come on up here, Tim-Tim. [Jimmy gets the big hat and turns to give it to Timmy, only to see him wheel away. Jimmy follows, and they end up in a parking lot away from the market] Timmy, when I tell you to do something, you do it!
Timmy
Timmih!
Jimmy
Timmy, don't make me k... kick you ass!
Timmy
Timmay!
Jimmy
Put on the hat!
Timmy
[smacks the hat down] Timmay!
Jimmy
Pu-put it on!!
Stan
Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. [he and Cartman leave the table and go towards Jimmy and Timmy. Timmy and Jimmy face off and start circling each other]
Timmy
[makes a fist] Timmih. Timmih.
Jimmy
Not this year.
Timmy
Timmih, Timmih.
Cartman
Cripple fight!
Timmy
Haaa.
Jimmy
Come on. Come on!
Timmy
Timmih.
South Park Church. A service is on, and organ music plays
Cartman
Cripple fight! [after a moment, the congregants get up and leave]
Henry's Supermarket, inside. Shoppers mill about, getting their items
Cartman
[on speakers] Attention, shoppers. Outside, we have... cripple fight. Cripple fight outside! [the shoppers abandon their carts and exit]
Parking lot. Timmy delivers the fist blow, to Jimmy's head, but Jimmy delivers four blows back with his crutches. The third one turns Timmy's head to the left. The fourth one turns Timmy's head to the right and forces the wheelchair backwards. Jimmy recovers and the rivals approach each other anew
Jimmy
Come on!
Jimmy jumps up and delivers a blow to Timmy's face, but Timmy responds with four quick blows - a right hook, two left jabs, and another right hook - sending Jimmy to the ground face first.
Jimmy
[struggling to get up] Uh.
Stan
Jesus Christ, dude! [a crowd begins to gather]
Susan
Oh my God!
Man 5
Just let 'em have it out, Susan. They'll run out of steam soon. [Jimmy gets up quickly and faces Timmy again]
Timmy
Hahnah Timmih.
Jimmy
[swipes at him, but Timmy blocks] Huah!
Timmy
Hahnah Timmih.
Jimmy
[swipes at Timmy again, but Timmy blocks] Come on!
Timmy
Timmih!
Jimmy
No! [swipes at him again, but Timmy blocks and quickly delivers a blow to the face, drawing fist blood] Ow!
Jimmy recoups and delivers a back-handed blow to Timmy with his right crutch, then measures Timmy and swings the crutch back and launches Timmy out of his chair. Timmy quickly scrambles back to his chair, but Jimmy whacks him away again. Camera movements get more dynamic. Timmy rolls over and Jimmy walks up to him and offers his left hand
Jimmy
Timmy? Timmy? [Timmy takes his hand and slowly rises to his feet. Jimmy helps him into the chair]
I told you to put on the HAT!! [swings his right crutch and blows Timmy out of the chair again. Jimmy walks up to Timmy and pulls him up by the hair, and swings the right crutch at him, but Timmy blocks it and holds both crutches down]
You dirty motherfucker! [hits Timmy with the crutches, and Timmy responds with a headbutt, knocking Jimmy down. Timmy goes down himself]
Man 5
[just arriving] What's goin' on?
Man 6
[turns to answer] Some kind of gay pride rally.
Timmy gets a hold of Jimmy and delivers a right cross. Jimmy responds by striking Timmy with both crutches, then grounding his crutches and swinging his legs up to strike Timmy agian. Next, Jimmy tries to pull Timmy off the wheelchair head first, then tries to get a reverse headlock on Timmy. Timmy breaks out of it and delivers a blow. They each try a headlock on the other, but the effort forces the wheelchair backwards, and they both fall out.
Timmy
Lah-livin' a lie!
Jimmy chokes Timmy for a bit, then rises to jump on him. Timmy tries to force Jimmy off by pushing Jimmy's face back, but Jimmy bites Timmy's fingers. Timmy cries in pain, then flips Jimmy off overhead. Jimmy scrambles up on his crutches as Timmy tends to his bitten hand, and strikes Timmy again, and again. Jimmy then swings his legs into Timmy and flies off - a flying kick. Timmy rises and jumps on Jimmy, grabbing his head and ramming it into the ground twice, then performing an eye gouge. Jimmy works around it and throws Timmy off, then jumps on him, driving a knee into Timmy's crotch five times, shot from various angles. Jimmy struggles to get up, and Timmy trips him.
Channel 4 News report
Reporter
Tom, I'm standing out in front of Henry's Supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting. The rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice.
Farmer
Those boys have shown me the light. I never knew the Mountain Scouts was a hate group.
Joe
[host of Joe n' Friends] This is a wake up call to America. We cannot turn our backs on gays anymore!
South Park Bar. People are looking at the report
Randy
Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.
Reporter
[voice only] The rally has also caught the attention of old Scouts members, like Steven Spielberg, director of such films as Always and 1941.
Cut to Channel 4 News report
Steven Spielberg
[at his desk] I salute those boys and their courage. I am hereby cutting all my funding to the Scouts!
Reporter
The rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer, Gloria Allred.
Gloria Allred
[at her desk] It is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate. [rises from her chair and pounds the desk] I am taking this case on, personally!
Reporter
With this kind of support, Tom, these boys are sure to have a victory for gays. Back to you.
Tom
Thanks, Chris. In other news, the FBI has finally caught the child molester known as Mr. Slippyfist. [pictured is Mr. Grazier being arrested, then his mug shot] This sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked, which we will show you now.
Cut to South Park Bar for reactions. The men are stunned
Tom
[voice only] Here's one. And here's another.
Stuart
Kenny?
Randy
Oh my God.
Tom
Here, look at this one. Sick sonofabitch! Here's one right here.
Jimmy and Timmy have taken to throwing each other all over the place. Jimmy and Timmy land on a car and tumble down to the ground beside it. The camera follows the action closely. Jimmy picks Timmy up and throws him back on the car, then swings his right crutch at Timmy, striking him, and strikes him again on the return swing. Timmy punches Jimmy with his left fist, sending Jimmy spinning around. Jimmy swings at Timmy again, but Timmy ducks and catches Jimmy in a sleeper hold, holding on for a few seconds. Jimmy escapes, then picks Timmy up high and brings him down upon the left knee for a back-breaker. Timmy rises and responds with a neck-breaker, knocking Jimmy out. Both boys lay there, motionless.
Man 6
Alright, boys, break it up.
Colorado Supreme Court, day, exterior shot. Inside, the justices enter and take their seats
Bailiff
All rise.
Chief Justice
In the case of Big Gay Al versus Mountain Scouts of America: due to the overwhelming show of support, it is the ruling of this court that the Scouts must allow Big Gay Al and all gays into their club!
Crowd
Alright! Yeah! Woohoo! [more cheering]
Randy
Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
Crowd
Yeah! [more cheering. Timmy and Jimmy, bruised and battered, sit next to each other]
Chief Justice
And furthermore, the Scout elders will be put into stocks for three days, so they can see how it feels to be outcast!
Crowd
Hooray, yeah, yeah! [more cheering]
Stan
We did it! We did it!
Gloria Allred
I did it! I did it! Haha! [the press gathers in around her.]
Colorado Supreme Court, day, outside. Gloria Allred is holding a press conference at the top of the steps at the courthouse
Gloria Allred
Today is a great day for democracy. The Scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are. [each of the three Scout elders is in a stock, and underneath each one is written "HOMOPHOBE" The crowd throws stones at them.] And we all it all to me, and these six brave little boys [the big bird comes down and plucks Kenny right up. The other kids, Al, and Gloria move aside and return, the kids stunned] five... brave little boys. And now, here to take his official oath back in Scouts is Big Gay Al. [moves aside]
Big Gay Al
[as the crowd cheers] Thank you all very much. But I don't want this. [the crowd quiets down and gets confused]
Crowd members
What's he saying?
Stan
Huh?
Big Gay Al
Look, I appreciate what you kids did; I really do. But this isn't what I wanted. I'm proud to be gay. And I'm proud to be in a country where I'm free to express myself. But freedom is a two-way street. If I'm free to express myself, then the Scouts have to be free to express themselves, too. I know these men. They are good men. They are kind men. They do what they think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn't right for us to force them to think our way. It's up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don't cut the Scouts' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That's why I love them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it. So, I am hereby dropping my case, and allowing the Scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club.
Man
Uh, Hooray!
Another Man
Hooray, hey!
Stan
So wait, did we do good?
Butters
Uh yeah, ah I think so.
Cartman
Eh, we kick ass.
Big Gay Al
[approaching the boys] Come on kids, let's go get some ice cream! [moves along]
Gloria Allred
[at the mic] You can't do this! You homophobe!
Jimmy
Well, Timmy, I guess we learned an important lesson, too, very much. There is room for more than one handi-capable person in Scouts.
Timmy
Timmih.
Jimmy
I'm glad we're best friends now. See ya at Scouts. [walks off]
Timmy
Tim-mih.
Timmy's house, exterior shot. Inside, Timmy is working on his computer in his room. He's working the keyboard and the mosue like an experienced user. He sings:
Timmy
Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih. [on screen is a picture of Timmy and Jimmy, in a Photo Wiz program. Timmy traces a cutout around Jimmy's head] Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih. [he clips the head off and moves it to the right, and grins] Aaaaah.
Stan
[stops at Timmy's room and enters. Timmy stops work to listen] Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! [walks out]
Park County Community Center, day. Inside the boys are seated around the table, and a new Scoutmaster, the head Scoutmaster, is present
Head Scoutmaster
Alright, boys, I am your new Scout leader. Everything is going to be just fine. No naked pictures.
Timmy
[rolls up to the scoutmaster] Uh, Timmih.
Head Scoutmaster
Yes, Timmy? [Timmy hands him an envelope, which he opens. He takes out a picture] Oh dear. Jimmy?
Jimmy
Yes?
Head Scoutmaster
You know our policy: I'm afraid you're... out of Scouts.
Jimmy
Out of Scouts? [the scoutmaster shows a picture of two naked men holding each other close from the waist down and looking at the camera. The paler man has Jimmy's head pasted over his]
Timmy
[with eyes half-closed, waves at Jimmy and grins] Tim-mih.
Jimmy
What? [the two other Scoutmasters come up behind Jimmy, pull him out of his chair, and carry him towards the entrance] Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
Stan
Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.
Butters
Me neither. [the two Scoutmasters prepare to toss him out the doors]
Jimmy
No! No! [the Scoutmasters toss him a good distance]
Timmy
[triumphantly] Timmay!
End of Cripple Fight

Super Best Friends
South Park, day. People mill around, but a group of them has gathered around a magician, tall and slender, with a severe face
Magician
Okay, Carol, put the card you picked back into the deck so I can't see ittwah. [Butters and Kenny are watching as Stan and Kyle rush up]
Stan
What's going on? [he and Kyle have ice cream cones. He has vanilla, Kyle strawberry]
Butters
Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?
Blaine
Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd. [Carol takes the card and shows it to the crowd. It is an ace of clubs] Was that the card you picked?
Carol
No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts.
Blaine
Four of hearts? Really? Look again.
Carol
[looks and find the four of hearts in her hand] Daa-ah!
Crowd
Oooohhhh! [applause]
Woman
Whoa
Kyle
That's pretty cool, dude!
Cartman
[walking up] Who's this asshole?
Kyle
He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
Cartman
Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?
Blaine
Sir, c- could you come over here? [Jimbo walks over] Now, what I want you to do, Mr...
Jimbo
Kern.
Blaine
Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind.
Jimbo
[shuts his eyes and keeps them shut] O-kay.
Blaine
Okay, jus... s think about your card. [a few seconds pass] okay, look at me. [Jimbo looks at him] Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass.
Jimbo
Huh??
Blaine
Go on, reach up your ass.
Jimbo
[reaches into his ass and digs around] Uh, I don't feel nothin'.
Blaine
Deeper.
Jimbo
[groans as he goes deeper] Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait... [pulls out a card and cleans the crap off it]
Blaine
Was that the card you picked?
Jimbo
[in disbelief] Yes! Oh my God!
Man
O-hoho! [more crowd reaction]
Kyle
Wow, that's cool!
Stan
How'd he do that??
Blaine
Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch. [goes into a meditative state] Watch. [slowly, he rises into the air]
Crowd
Whoa!!!
Stan
No way!
Kyle
Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
Blaintologist
[passing out pamphlets through the crowd] Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids, take a pamphlet. [Kyle takes one and reads from it]
Kyle
"David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic." Dude, we gotta go.
Cartman
Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
The David Blaine Complex, in the middle of nowhere, day.
Speaker
Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most?
Stan
His a-miracles?
Steven
Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader.
Cartman
When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
Stan
Yeah!
Steven
Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?
Butters
I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
Steven
...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-
Butters
And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
Steven
Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you? [focus on a stunned Kyle] You're not really happy.
Kyle
[thinking] I'm not really happy.
Steven
Your potential hasn't even been reached.
Kyle
[thinking] My potential hasn't even been reached.
Steven
[holds up the book] If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?
Cartman
Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
Steven
That's right.
Cartman
Cool.
Kyle's house, day. In the dining room, Sheila is trying to feed Ike, who is in a baby chair.
Sheila
Ike, eat your gefilte fish. [Ike pulls away as far as he can]
Ike
No-oo.
Kyle
[rushes in with Blaine's book] Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
Sheila
That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!
Kyle
We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
Sheila
Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this.
Kyle
So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95.
Sheila
Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father. [Kyle turns and walks out] Ike, you will eat this!
The David Blaine Complex, in the middle of nowhere, day. The new recruits are having their hair shaved off their heads
Barber
Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.
Butters
[Solemnly] I am prepared. [the barber takes the clippers and clips Butters' hair off in one swoop. The hair ends up on the floor in one piece] Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
Barber
Next? [Mr. Garrison appears...]
The David Blaine Complex, main room
Steven
Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean. [a shot of the new recruits. They all look the same] Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head.
Recruits
Wow!
Steven
So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize! [eight boys gravitate towards each other]
Stan
[talking to a boy between him and Cartman] Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
Butters
Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle.
Stan
No, I'm Stan.
Kyle
[behind Butters] You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
Stan
Who are you?
Kyle
I'm Kyle.
Cartman
[thinking he's indistinguishable] Heheh, guess who I am, guys?
Stan
Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here.
Kyle
[steps back to join Stan] What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
Stan
Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
Kyle
But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow.
Stan
I don't care! I'm leaving! [walks towards the door, but a man blocks the way] 'Scuse me. [eerie music begins]
Aide
Where are you going?
Stan
I'm going home.
Aide
You don't want to go home.
Stan
You said we're free to leave whenever we want
Aide
You are.
Stan
Move out of the way.
Aide
I'm not in the way. You are. Are you unhappy with the Church's teachings? Let's just talk about it
Stan
I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave.
Aide
Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave.
Stan
[begins to back away, intimidated] That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
Aide
That's great news. [escorts Stan back to the group]
The David Blaine Complex, dorm, night. Stan peers out from a door into a hall.
Stan
Okay, it's all clear. [exits with Kyle]
Kyle
What are we doing?
Stan
We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
Kyle
Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere.
Stan
Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!
Kyle
It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something.
Stan
A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
Kyle
Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
Stan
No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
Kyle
I'm not going anywhere!
Stan
Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
Kyle
Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
Stan
Oh wait, who am I again?
Kyle
You're Stan.
Stan
Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second. [pulls out his hat and puts it on] Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
Kyle
Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. [turns and walks back to his room. Stan turns back to face the hall and watched Kyle walk away]
Stan
Kyle, please. You- [looks down and to the left, then looks up] You're my best friend.
Kyle
Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. [opens the door to his room and walks in. Stan looks, then turns towards the exit and walks out]
South Park, next day. Cartman and Kyle walk down a sidewalk visiting houses. They approach a pink house.
Kyle
Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
Elderly Woman
Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic.
Cartman
Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
Kyle
That's right.
Elderly Woman
So you're not a cult?
Cartman
[giggles] Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you.
Elderly Woman
Well, alright, come on in.
Cartman
Cool. [the woman shows the boys in]
Elderly woman's house, living room, moments later. The woman and the two boys sit on the sofa. Kyle has his book open.
Kyle
...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
Cartman
Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
Elderly Woman
No, not really.
Cartman
Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
Kyle
David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night. [closes his book] We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
Cartman
He's going to eat his own head.
Kyle
How many tickets can we put you down for?
Elderly Woman
Oh, I can't go.
Cartman
Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
Elderly Woman
I am happy.
Cartman
No you're not.
Elderly Woman
Yes I am.
Cartman
No you're not.
Elderly Woman
I really am.
Cartman
No you're not.
Elderly Woman
But I am.
Cartman
No you're not.
Elderly Woman
Alright, two tickets
Kyle
Great!
Sidewalk. Kyle and Cartman exit the elderly woman's house
Kyle
That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
Cartman
Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
Kyle
I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- [they reach the corner. Facing them on the opposite corner is Stan, standing by his bike]
Cartman
Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. [turns right and walks down the street. Kyle looks back at Stan for a few seconds, then follows Cartman. Stan turns and walks down the street in the same direction Kyle and Cartman were walking, but stops when a car appears in front of him. He sees some adult Blaintologists inside. The driver starts the car and moves towards Stan, who turns about face and begins to run with his bike. The car looms behind him and he lets go of his bike.]
Stan
HaaAAAA! [the car totals the bike, bumps Stan onto the sidewalk, and peels away.]
Driver
You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner! [Stan looks at the car, scared.]
Jesus' house, next day. Stan walks up and rings the doorbell
Stan
Hi, Jesus. It's me.
Stan, Jesus
Stan Marsh.
Jesus
Of course. I know you, my child. Come in.
Jesus' house, living room. A pitcher of water sits on the coffee table
Stan
This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
Jesus
You're good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.
Stan
I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they'll all see that David Blaine isn't so special.
Jesus
The miracle I'm most famous for is turning water into wine.
Stan
Can you do it again?
Jesus
Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around. [Stan looks at Jesus quizzically. Jesus is now holding the pitcher] Er, nuh, tur- turn around. [Stan turns away and Jesus quickly switches pitchers] Uh, okay now, turn back. [Stan turns back] It is now wine!
Stan
That's it? That's how you did that trick?
Jesus
Wuh well, yeah.
Stan
That trick sucks, Jesus.
Jesus
Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago.
Stan
Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He's gonna get more followers, and it'll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.
Jesus
Then let's go.
Stan
But dude, I'd I don't think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.
Jesus
Oh,don't worry [rises and joins Stan out the door] I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.
Denver, night. An arena is shown, and the place is packed. Kyle and Cartman are seated in the third row, with around Blaintologists around them
Kyle
This is a really good turnout.
Announcer
And now, ladies and gentlemen, David Blaine. [pyrotechnics go off all around, three spotlights shine on Blaine, and the crowd cheers]
Blaine
Hello, my children.
Announcer
Ladies and gentlemen, may we have silence, please, as magician David Blaine will now eat... his... own... head. [Blaine looks around, and a drumroll begins. Blaine then proceeds to eat his own head, then falls over. A few moments later the crowd roars with approval]
Kyle
Dude, no way! [two female Blaintology assistants rush up and help Blaine stand. One has a little cage, another has a small curtain and rod. The one to his right places the cage where the head would be, while the one on the left places the curtain in front. A few seconds later, Blaine's head is back on his shoulders. The audience cheers]
Blaine
Thank you, everyone. [the audience quiets down] Our organization grows larger every day. Soon, the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion.
Jesus
[walking down the steps towards the stage] Hold!
Man
It's Jesus! [more murmurs]
Cartman
What's he doin' here? [Jesus goes on stage]
Jesus
My children, it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet. You should be using your money and time for other things. These are simple magic tricks. His magic is interesting, but will it put food on your table? Feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle! [a cart with loaves and fishes is wheeled in by Stan.] Behold! I have here fives loaves of bread and three fish. Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around [the crowd stares back blankly] Ya need tuh- turn around. [Stan slaps his hand to his forehead, but the crowd turns around. Jesus proceeds to pull bread and fish from behind the cart and pour it over the original bread and fish. Soon the cart is hidden under the food] Okay, now turn back. [the crowd turns back and just looks]
Cartman
Now how the hell did he do that? [Blaine simply extends his right arm, lifts the bread and fish mentally from the cart and drops them over by Stan]
Crowd
Wow!
Blaine
Your magic is old and outdated, Jesus! Twah. Just like you are.
Jesus
Oh, really. Then what's this [reaches behind Blaine's ear and pulls out a card] Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?
Crowd
Whoa. [some chatter. Blaine then levitates, goes into a spin and disappears into a deck of cards, which then splits in two. Each half traces a circle and then both halves combine to make a larger circle. This circle then becomes a tornado of cards, and David Blaine emerges from the tornado triumphant.]
Jesus
[overwhelmed] Jesus Christ!
Elderly Woman
[seated with her husband] He's incredible!
Blaine
The old religions have failed you! Twah. What have they offered except for war, poverty, and sadness? Blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest! Will you join us?
Crowd
Yes!!
The arena, outside. Jesus and Stan exit the arena
Jesus
His magic is too powerful, Stanley. I've never seen anything like it.
Stan
Then what are we going to do.
Jesus
I cannot face him alone. We must get the help of all the super best friends. [speaks into his left wrist] Buddha. Buddha, come in!
Stan
Super best friends?
Buddha
[on a little screen on Jesus' unique watch] This is Buddha, Jesus. Go ahead.
A futuristic headquarters, somewhere... Jesus appears on a giant screen as Buddha awaits Jesus' answer
Jesus
Buddha, we may have a problem. I've just encountered a magic I've never seen before.
Buddha
I'll call everyone together. Come as fast as you can.
Jesus
Come, Stanley. We must travel far and long.
Stan
To where?
Jesus
Distances unfathomable to man. Yea, take hold of my robe, Stanley, and do not open your eyes.
Stan
[shuts his eyes] I am ready.
Inside an airplane. Jesus and Stan have center seats, and Stan's eyes are still shut
Jesus
Are you still keeping your eyes closed?
Stan
Yeah.
Jesus
Good. Want some peanuts?
The David Blaine Complex, night. Blaintologists gather in the main room, and a new member is having his hair shaved off
Kyle
Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
Steven
[rushes up to the podium] Everyone! Everyone, gather 'round! I have great news for all Blaintologists, and for our new members as well. We've just gotten word from Mr. Blaine himself: The government has denied our church's request for tax-exempt status!
Member
But... we want tax-exempt status.
Kyle
Yeah. Why is that good news?
Steven
Be-cause! Mr. Blaine has arranged for all Blaintologists members from every city and state to march into Washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide!
Kyle
Mass suicide?
Steven
Mr. Blaine has said that by killing ourselves in Washington, we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife!
Member
Hehehe, that sounds good. [other members echo the sentiment]
Steven
Get your things ready. We leave for Washington at dawn!
Cartman
[jubilant] Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
A blue sky in a big city. The camera pans down to show Jesus and Stan in a park-like setting
Jesus
Alright, Stanley. You can open your eyes now. [before them is a stone-and-glass building] This is the hall of the super best friends, Stanley, the headquarters for those who stand for what's right.
Mohammad
Jesus, we've been working hard since we got your distress call!
Loa Tse
Who the kid?
Jesus
Stanley, I want you to meet some of the super best friends [they are shown when mentioned]: Buddha, with the powers of invisibility; Mohammad, the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame [he raises his hands palm up and a blast of flame emerges from each hand]; Krishna, the Hindu deity; Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet; Lao Tse, the found of Taoism [performs some martial arts moves with his cane]; and Seaman, with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish.
Stan
So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
Mohammad
More than friends, young boy, we are super best friends, with the desire to fight for justice.
Joseph Smith
We all believe in the power of good over evil. Except for Buddha, of course, who doesn't believe in evil. [Buddha shrugs and grins]
Stan
Wow.
Mohammad
Jesus, come look at this. [they walk to the monitor console with Stan following] After your distress call, we entered David Blaine in the super best friends' computer.
Seaman
[operating the console] Many interesting things showed up. He was raised in New York city by a decent family, but a freak washing-machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of the black arts.
Buddha
That's right, Seamen. [the other super best friends laugh at how Buddha said Seaman's name]
Seaman
[insulted] Sea Man!
Buddha
Uh that's what I said. Seamen. [the others laugh some more]
Seaman
Stop it!
The David Blaine Complex, dorm, night. Kyle walks up to Cartman's bunk.
Kyle
[whispering] Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
Cartman
[sits up abruptly, knocking Kyle off the bed] No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? [now alert, if confused, and Kyle stands up]
Kyle
It's just me.
Cartman
[sighs silently] Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
Kyle
Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
Cartman
What?
Kyle
I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad.
Cartman
Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either. [points to his groin] I haven't even gotten my pubes yet.
Kyle
I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
Cartman
That co- ugh. [drops to a whisper] That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
Kyle
Okay. Okay, you're right. [goes down the ladder to his own bunk, underneath Cartman's, and Cartman turns over to sleep] Oh uh Cartman: thanks. [goes to sleep. Later, he wakes up inside a large domed platform. Reflections of five adult Blaintologists and Cartman can be seen on the glass dome. He sits up and blinks] Cartman? [He tries to move, but encounters the glass. He taps to make sure] What the hell? [Camera pulls back to reveal...]
The David Blaine Complex, main room. The Blaintologists and Cartman look on.
Cartman
I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
Kyle
What have you done, Cartman?!
Cartman
This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
Blaine
You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause.
Cartman
Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
Kyle
[knocking on the dome] Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
Cartman
At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
Blaine
The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together. [Cartman and the Blaintologists exit and leave Kyle alone, afraid]
the Hall of the Super Best Friends, day.
Narrator
[speaks for the fist time] Meanwhile, at the Hall of Super Best Friends...
Joseph Smith
Look at that, Jesus. His followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine! It appears this David Blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared.
Stan
I knew it.
Jesus
Here. I have a videotape of his performance the other night.
Joseph Smith
Perhaps we should have Moses look at the tape and see what he comes up with. [Mohammad takes the tape to Moses]
Mohammad
Moses, scan this tape. Can you tell us the source of Blaine's power?
Moses
[just as he appeared in "Jewbilee"] Give me the information. [Mohammad slips the tape into a slot near Moses' tip. Stan smiles]
Stan
Wow, the Moses.
Moses
His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand. Wait a minute: I'm picking up movement from Blaintologists from all over the country.
Lao Tse
The Blaintologists are heading to Washington. But why?
Jesus
Wait a minute. At his performance David Blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status.
Joseph Smith
Omigod!
Lao Tse
What?
Joseph Smith
If he gets tax-exempt status, then he'll become a real religion.
Krishna
He would become unstoppable
Washington D.C., day. The Blaintologists have gathered around the Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial
Narrator
Meanwhile, in the nation's capital, Blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide!
Blaine
[facing the audience, with the Washington Monument in the distance] If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah.
Steven
Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around. [they do so] It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool! [he steps down into the pool] However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such. [drops down into the water and floats on his stomach, expelling air for a few seconds, then groans to death as water fills his lungs. The corpse begins to float away]
Man
Next! [A woman drops in, than a man...]
The White House, day. The White House staff gathers at one of the windows to watch. Shown are Princess, Laura and George W. Bush, Karl Rove, and Maggie
Narrator
Meanwhile, at the White House...
Karl Rove
Mr. President, we can't let them all kill themselves!
George Bush
Well we can't give them tax-exempt status either, Karl!
Larry
[walks in] He-e-ey George! What's gon' on?
Washington D.C., day. Cartman gets ready to flood Kyle, who's still in the glass dome, with a fire hose. More corpses float in the Reflecting Pool
Cartman
Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! [pushes the dome into the pool]
Kyle
Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
Cartman
[brings the hose over] But it's the only way for us to be happy. [plugs the hose into the dome and releases the water]
Kyle
Cartman, no!
The Reflecting Pool, later
Blaine
Give us what we want or we will continue to die
Jesus
Not so fast, David Blaine!
Blaine
Jesus! Not again.
Jesus
Yes! But this time, I've brought some help! Super Best Friends! [they fly down as they are announced]
Buddha
Buddha!
Mohammad
Mohammad!
Joseph Smith
Joseph Smith!
Krishna
Krishna!
Lao Tse
Lao Tse!
Seaman
Sea-Man!
Jesus
The mass suicide is over, Blaine! And so are you!
Blaine
I don't think so. Get them! [Blaintologists go on the attack. Two of them go for Mohammad, who shoots flames at them. They scream.]
Joseph Smith
My ice breath should take care of you. [blasts some air at an oncoming Blaintologist, who freezes in place]
Stan
[emerges from the crowd and looks around the Reflecting Pool] Kyle! Kyle!
Blaintologist
Sweet Salvation! [Stan sees the man drown, then notices a boy in the pool]
Stan
Kyle?? [frantically, he goes into the pool and reaches the boy, turning him over. A few seconds of observation and... gasp] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle
[off-screen] You bastards!
Stan
Kyle? [looks to his left and calls out] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle
[off-screen] You bastards! [Stan looks up and follows Kyle's voice]
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Jesus
That takes care of them.
Joseph Smith
Now it's your turn, Blaine!
Blaine
Perhaps you need to see some real magic. [floats up to Lincoln's left foot and touches it. His magic infuses the statue with life, and Lincoln breaks free from his chair]
Lincoln
Raaargh! [steps down towards the crowd]
Buddha
Oh this looks like trouble.
Blaine
[floating high above the crowd] So long, Super Best Fools!
Stan
[reaches Kyle] Kyle!
Kyle
Stan!
Stan
Kyle, you can't kill yourself!
Kyle
I don't want to kill myself. They rigged this thing to fill with water! [tremulous footsteps are felt, and Lincoln is shown walking among the crowd of Blaintologists]
Jesus
We've gotta stop that oversized Abraham Lincoln! Mohammad! [Mohammad rises into the air and blasts Lincoln with flames. Lincoln growls and swats Mohammad away with ease] Great Scott!
Cartman
[trying to drown himself from the edge of the Reflecting Pool] Bliegh! [rises. His body is on land] Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep [dunks his head in the water again].
Shot of Washington D.C. from the Vietnam Memorial. Lincoln is taking buildings off their foundations and tossing them aside. Krishna, in the form of an eagle, flies over the scene. Flames are everywhere.
Mohammad
It is too powerful, Jesus!
Krishna
[lands] It seems to have no weakness!
Jesus
There has to be a way to destroy it. [raises his left wrist to speak into the watch] Jesus to Moses!
The Hall of Super Best Friends, day, at that moment
Narrator
Meanwhile, at the Super Best Friends League...
Jesus
Come in, Moses!
Moses
What?
Jesus
We need to know how to kill a giant stone Abraham Lincoln.
Moses
...Um... Let me think, um... a giant stone John Wilkes Booth?
Jesus
[thinks for a moment] You heard him, Super Best Friends! We've got to make a giant stone John Wilkes Booth!
Mohammad
Krishna, we're going to need wood for a mold!
Krishna
Form of... a beaver! [transforms into a beaver and runs off to chop down trees]
Mohammad
I will find sources to concrete. [points to Seaman] You, get the water to mix it with, Seaman. [the other friends laugh]
Narrator
Using the wood that Krishna cut down as a beaver, Jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold.
Jesus
That should do the trick. Now for some concrete.
Narrator
Meanwhile, in the ocean depths, Seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete.
Seaman
Sea-Man! [lands on the ocean bottom] Look, Swallow, we should be able to divert the water with that pipe.
Narrator
And so, Seaman and Swallow get to... get to work [laughs]
The Reflecting Pool, later. Water fills the bubble Kyle is in, and he struggles to breathe
Stan
Kyle, you have to hold your breath! [a giant stone hand comes down and grabs the bubble as Stan looks on helplessly. Everyone backs away from the stone Lincoln as it holds Kyle in its left hand. Lincoln shakes Kyle around like a snow globe, and Stan gets mad] Oh, very funny! [Seaman and Joseph Smith pour the raw materials needed for a statue into Jesus' mold, and Mohammad fires the statue like a piece of clay. The likeness of John Wilkes Booth appears on the statue]
Jesus
Lao Tse, bring it to life. [Lao Tse puts index fingers to temples and shuts his eyes to concentrate on the task at hand]
Narrator
Using his power of Taoism, Lao Tse becomes one with the giant stone John Wilkes Booth. [the Booth statue begins to move. It breaks out of its mold, walks up behind the Lincoln statue, and fires one stone bullet into the back of Lincoln's head. Lincoln's head jerks back, and he falls forward, ending up face down. The bubble falls out of his hand and breaks up on the ground. Kyle is washed out]
Kyle
Wagh. [sits up]
Jesus
It worked. Now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves! [Quickly, Joseph Smith reaches the Reflecting Pool and blows ice-cold air over it. The water turns to white ice as other Blaintologists try to drown themselves. Cartman tries once more, but looks up quickly]
Cartman
Hey, I was just about to do it.
The Reflecting Pool, later. The crowd of Blaintologists is still there, and the water has melted
Narrator
Later, at exactly the same location...
Blaine
[now in his escape vehicle, on its own launcher] Damn you, Super Best Friends!
Jesus
Your magic is no match for our powers combined, Blaine!
Blaine
Then I guess you win this time, Super Best Fools! But I'll be back! [he fires up the little rocket ship and takes off into the sky]
Jesus
Goddamnit! [behind him and the other Super Best Friends is a city in ruins]
Buddha
It's alright. Everything is as it should be.
Jesus
Oh, shut up, Buddha!
Steven
Our leader, he... he's leaving us! [a Blaintologist, about to drown himself, looks up and sees the ship fly away]
Blaintologist
Don't leave us, David Blaine!
Stan
[with mic. Kyle and Cartman stand some distance to his left] Listen up, everyone! [the Super Best Friends gather behind him] You don't need David Blaine to tell you how to live. See, cults are dangerous because they promise you hope, happiness and, maybe even an afterlife. But in return, they demand you pay money. Any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and... learn its tenets is wrong. See, all religions have something valuable to teach, but, just like the Super Best Friends learned, it requires a little bit of them all.
Blaintologist
He's right. He... he's right! [the crowd cheers, and Stan walks over to Kyle]
Kyle
Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
Stan
Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.
Cartman
Oh, that's so sweet you guys. [Stan and Kyle are not amused] You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh [Kyle turns and kicks Cartman in the groin, knocking him down]
Kyle
[moves away so Stan can have a turn] Haha, hehahaha.
Cartman
[Stan kicks him] Ah! [Kyle's turn] Ow, stop it! [Stan's turn] Ah! [they continue taking turns kicking Cartman in the groin — Roshambo!]
Jesus
Well, it looks like everything worked out. [the Super Best Friends take off into the air]
Narrator
And so, Jesus and his companions leave Washington. But their return is assured, for there will always be a need for... the Super Best Friends!
End of Super Best Friends

Scott Tenorman Must Die
Morning in South Park. Cartman is riding his Big Wheels down the road, singing to himself. He soon reaches the bus stop. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are standing there
Cartman
Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?

Kyle
What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! [Cartman gets off his bike]
Cartman
[coolly] Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.
Stan
What's no big deal?
Cartman
Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
Kyle
...What the hell are you talking about?!
Cartman
Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! [dances]
Kenny
(You got pubes??)
Kyle
What's "pubes"?
Stan
Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
Kyle
Oh. [to Cartman] No you didn't!
Cartman
Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
Stan
He's lying. [turns and walks away. Kenny follows, then Kyle]
Cartman
You wanna see 'em?
Kyle
[turns to look at them] Hell no! [Stan and Kenny turn to look]
Cartman
[reaches into his pants] Here, check 'em out.
Stan
[looks away and hides his eyes] We don't wanna see them, Cartman! [Kyle turns around, Kenny shuts his hood tight]
Cartman
There, see?! How do you like them apples! [in his right hand is a clump of pubic hair. The other boys look, with Kyle ready to cover his eyes again] HA!
Kyle
[approaches] Uh what are those? [Stan and Kenny follow]
Cartman
My pubes.
Stan
What??
Cartman
I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
Kyle
Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
Cartman
Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks. [sing-song] Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! [dances a little more]
Stan
Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
Cartman
[moves in between Stan and Kyle and embraces them, one under each arm, and gloats. Kyle looks at Cartman's right hand] Don't be jealous, guys. [Kyle looks at Cartman] This doesn't mean we can't still hang out. [Kyle looks back at Cartman's hand] It just means that I matured faster than you. [Kyle fears for that hair touching him] You'll get your pubes guys, someday.
Kyle
Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
Cartman
Uh oo what?
Stan
When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
Cartman
Nuh uh!
Kyle
Yuh huh!
Cartman
[looks at his purchase] But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
Kyle
Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
Cartman
You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
Kyle
Yeah.
Cartman
[walks off in a huff] Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
A lavender house, day. Three teens sit on the front steps
Scott
And so I told him, I said "Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks." And this stupid asshole buys them! [the other two boys laugh]
Another boy
Oh man! [Cartman makes his way up to the boys]
Scott
Speak of the devil! What do you want?
Cartman
Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
Scott
Uh uh, I don't take returns!
Cartman
Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
Scott
You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!
Cartman
Just give me back my money...
Scott
Buyer beware, dude!
Cartman
Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
Scott
Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! [defeated, Cartman walks away]
Scott's house, later. Cartman rings the doorbell
Cartman
[in costume, with briefcase] Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.

Scott
You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
Cartman
[thinks a bit] Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
Scott
Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
Cartman
You will? Oh, cool!
Scott
How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?
Cartman
Oh. Uh, lessee. [pulls out some money] I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
Scott
Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars. [done.] And then I'll... give you the twenty.
Cartman
...Okay.
Scott
Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars.
Cartman
Right.
Scott
Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back.
Cartman
Cool.
Scott
And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. [walks back in the house with his money back]
Cartman
Sweet! [the door closes] Uh. Oh, goddamnit!
Bijou movie house, later. The boys are going to see a "BIG WAR MOVIE"
Cartman
That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
Kyle
Cartman, can I give you some advice?
Cartman
What?!
Kyle
Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
Cartman
He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! [the boys reach the box office and buy their tickets]
Kyle
One please.
Stan
One please.
Kenny
(One please.)
Cartman
One please. [with no money, he tries to pay with pubic hair. Nothing happens for a while]
Clerk
That'll be six dollars.
Cartman
O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
Clerk
We don't take pubes!
Cartman
Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
Clerk
We don't take pubes!! End of story!!
Cartman
Racist! [takes the pubes and runs off]
Scott's house, later. Cartman rings the doorbell again
Cartman
Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
Scott
Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!
Cartman
[stunned] What?
Scott
Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
Cartman
[softly] Wha-? Uh oo [audibly] why do you want then back so much?
Scott
No reason.
Cartman
I don't believe you.
Scott
Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
Cartman
Pube fair?
Scott
They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!
Cartman
Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
Scott
Hehere, take your money!
Cartman
Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
Scott
Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!
Cartman
Haha, charade you are, Scott! [runs away quickly]
Scott
Have you no heart??
Bus Terminal, day. Cartman stands in line waiting for a trip to Fort Collins. People are boarding the bus
Cartman
[cuts through the line] Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! [enters the bus]
Bus, evening. The sun has already set and Cartman is still on the bus, en route to Fort Collins
Cartman
Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
Fort Collins, night. Cartman gets off the bus and walks
Cartman
Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.
Man
Yes?
Cartman
Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
Man
The pube fair?
Cartman
Yeah, I have some pubes to sell.
Man
There's no such thing, you little smartass! [walks away]
Cartman
No- no such thing?
Teen boy
[approaches with a box] Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric Karp-man, would you?
Cartman
I'm Eric Cartman!
Teen boy
Well, I think this is for you. [hands it to Cartman and walks away. Cartman sets the box down and opens it. He looks in, and a look of shock is on his face. He reaches in and pulls out... more pubic hair]
Cartman
[screams] Aaah!!!
Scott's house, night. Cartman rings the doorbell again, this time in the rain. Scott answers. Cartman is soaked with rain, his beanie wrinkling
Cartman
A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
Scott
You really went? What a 'tard.
Cartman
Alright, Scott, you win. I give up.
Scott
You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought.
Cartman
Yeah, I'll see you around. [walks down the steps and towards the street, but stops] Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
Scott
Your grandma?
Cartman
[turns around] Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down.
Scott
Oh. [strokes his chin] Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that.
Cartman
Yeah. Poor grandma...
Scott
Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. [through the window, Scott is seen going for the money]
Cartman
[evilly, to himself] Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. [turns around and returns to the house. Scott returns]
Scott
Here you go.
Cartman
Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! [Scott withholds the money]
Scott
But... just one thing before I give it to you:
Cartman
What?
Scott
I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
Cartman
Huh?
Scott
Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
Cartman
Why??
Scott
Do you want your grandma to live or not?!
Cartman
[looks around to make sure no one else is watching, then quickly] Please Scott give me my money.
Scott
Nono, get down on your knees. [Cartman begins to get on his knees] Lower your head [Cartman lowers it], and say "I beg you to give me back my money."
Cartman
I beg you to give me back my money.
Scott
Now say, "I'm a little piggy."
Cartman
What?!
Scott
Say it!
Cartman
[looks around] I'm a little piggy.
Scott
[points to his nose] "Here's my snout."
Cartman
[points to his nose] Here's my snout.
Scott
"Oink oink oink."
Cartman
Oink oink oink.
Scott
Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!
Cartman
[looks back angrily for a few seconds, then]
I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
[Scott begins to laugh]
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!

Scott
You mean this? [Cartman brightens up] You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. [holds the bills out and strikes a lighter under them]
Cartman
What- What are you doing?? [the bills light up and burn from one end to the other. Scott lets the burning bills float away] No!.. wuh...why?
Scott
Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! [turns around and enters the house, shutting the door behind him. Cartman then turns and walks towards the street anew. Halfway there, he looks at his mitts, then grows indignant]
Cartman
[yells] Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
Cartman's house, cellar. The kids in class has been reunited for something important. They're chattering amongst themselves
Cartman
[descending the stairs] Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming. [walks to the easel] I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all! [Clyde raises his hand] Yes, Clyde!
Clyde
Who's Scott Tenorman?
Kids
Yeah.
Kyle
Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off.
Cartman
[correcting Kyle] Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
Butters
Wuh what are you gonna do?
Cartman
Did you guys see that movie "Hannibal"? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony [flips the first page over to reveal a drawing of a pony and takes up the pointer with his left hand], we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener. [the other kids just stare back, but Cartman continues] It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!
Kyle
What's in it for us?
Cartman
What?
Stan
Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
Cartman
Oh, right. Why should we care? [slaps the pointer into his right hand] Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, "It's not your problem." But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, "You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!" [flips to the next page, which has written on it "$16.12" with double underline] Now who's with me?!! [turns around to find only one other person in the basement]
Timmy
Timmay!
Cartman
[slaps his forehead and sighs] Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!
Timmy
Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih. [rolls out of the room. Cartman is stunned, then angry]
A barn, day. Cartman stands next to a scarecrow. He pulls out a frank from a bag of wieners and places it in the scarecrow's crotch
Cartman
There we go. [stands aside] Come and get it. [camera pulls back to reveal a pony nearby] ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it. [the pony looks, then approaches] Come on, good pony. That's it! [the pony sniffs the wiener] Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony! [the pony bares its teeth... only to start licking the wiener] Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
Jimbo
[rushing up with Ned after eying Cartman in the corral] Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!
Cartman
No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. [by this time, the pony is sucking on the wiener]
Jimbo
Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know.
Cartman
He said it was okay.
Jimbo
Alright, then. [turns to walk away, but remembers something] Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?
Cartman
Because [ominously] of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
Jimbo
Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there.
Cartman
[noticing the sucking] Not like that, pony! [slaps the wiener out of its mouth]
Jimbo
Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. [the pony reaches for the wiener and starts sucking it again]
Cartman
Whattayou mean?
Jimbo
Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
Cartman
How do I do that?
Scott's house, night. Cartman appears in the bushes across the street. He pulls out binoculars and checks out the various rooms in the house. He sees Scott in his room, with Radiohead posters on his wall
Jimbo
[pops up] What do you see? [Ned pops up. All three are in camouflage]
Cartman
I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
Jimbo
No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill.
Cartman
Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
Jimbo
Oo what's a Radiohead?
Cartman
You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner...
Ned
Mmuh what am I doing here?
Jimbo
Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!
Cartman
So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a [British accent] li'l ol' scheme [normal] that involves them.
Jimbo
Nice thinking, young hunter.
Cartman
Whoa!
Jimbo
What?
Cartman
I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
Jimbo
What?! Give me those! [rips the binoculars away and looks for himself] Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!
Ned
Mn let me see.
Cartman
Radiohead. Yes, of course. [drops down]
Jimbo
Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!
Ned
Let me see. Let me see.
Jimbo
Here you go. [allows Ned to look through the binoculars, and Ned begins to masturbate] Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?
Ned
Kinda.
Jimbo
Well, stop it! [the porch light turns on and Mr. Tenorman walks out the front door. Jimbo and Ned freeze]
Mr. Tenorman
Hey, what the hell are you doing out there?!
Jimbo
[hushed] Oh crap!
Mr. Tenorman
Who's out there?
Jimbo
[hushed] Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!
Ned
I can't.
Mr. Tenorman
Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police! [Jimbo and Ned witness other men rise from the pushes and split. Among them are Randy, in a Groucho Marx outfit; Gerald, dressed as a clown; Stuart, with a paper shopping bag over his head; one man in scuba gear, and one more man]
A man
Whoa, I gotta get out of here! [Mr. Tenorman is left wondering why so many men were there.]
Scott's house, the next day. Cartman returns yet again and rings the doorbell. Scott answers.
Cartman
[cheerfully] Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
Scott
Uh huh.
Cartman
Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. [gloats] Everyone's gonna be there!
Scott
Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me.
Cartman
You're welcome, Scott. [turns and walks away]
Downtown South Park, night. Cartman stands on a small stage as a crowd gathers. On stage is a big-screen TV and tower speakers
Cartman
Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? [activates the screen and then walks off stage]
Kurt Loder
Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now. [Cartman joins the crowd and stands next to Scott, his mood changing from happy to mad] Guys, when is the next album coming out?
Cartman
[has taped over the band's answers with his own — first as Thom Yorke] That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid. [now as Johnny Greenwood] Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too. [Now as Ed O'Brien] I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?
Cartman
Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? [Scott looks down, and ponders Cartman's role]
Kurt Loder
And will there be a new tour?
Cartman
[Now as Phil Selway] Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to. [Now as Thom Yorke] Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
Cartman
Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. [Scott is gone] Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! [feedback is heard] What a retard! [the kids around him face right] And now everyone saw it! [looks around]
Scott
[off screen] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! [moves aside to show an ever bigger TV, which is turned on. Scott has apparently filmed Cartman earlier begging for his money]
Cartman
[on screen] '"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink."' [the kids begin to laugh hard, then harder. The same clip is shown over and over, and Kenny begins to laugh. Soon he can't control himself, and falls over dead. His ghost appears and continues laughing]
Stan
[looks over at Kenny's corpse] Oh my God, he killed Kenny.
Cartman
[seething with anger] That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
That night, dark and stormy, appropriate for Cartman's mood at the moment, Cartman's house. A boy possessed, he's in his room devising a new plan. An evil look comes across his face
Cartman
Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!! [goes into whispers and brings out a protractor and a compass] Then... that... [finishes his plan] Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! [a truly evil grin appears on his face.]
Mr. Denkins' farm, next day. Cartman is back at the corral waiting for his friends. Stan and Kyle walk up.
Kyle
Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
Cartman
Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
Stan
Got what all figured out?
Cartman
How to get Scott Tenorman back!
Kyle
[rolls his eyes] Oh, Jesus!
Cartman
I just finished planning a brilliant [British accent] li'l scheme [normal] that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. [holds out two fingers]
Kyle
Okay, so what's the plan?
Cartman
It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?
Stan
Yeah.
Cartman
So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! [camera pulls back to reveal the setup: pony, scarecrow with wiener attached to groin]
Kyle
...What?
Cartman
Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! [laughs demonically] Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! [nothing happens for a few seconds]
Kyle
You're such a dumbass, Cartman. [he and Stan turn and walk away]
Cartman
...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! [walks over to the pony] Ready, pony? [the pony nods] Bite it! [the pony bites off a piece of the wiener] Yes!! [exults]
London Recording Studio, day. Inside, Radiohead prepares to record. One of them is on the floor reading fan mail
Johnny
Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do.
Thom
Just a second, fellas. Listen to this:
Dear Radiohead, My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday around 5.

Phil
Wow, we have to go.
Ed
To Colorado? But we have an album to mix.
Thom
Didn't you hear the letter?? This poor kid has cancer! In his ass!
Scott's house, day. A phone rings. Scott answers it in the living room.
Scott
Hello?
Kyle
[voice at other end] Scott Tenorman?
Scott
What do you want?!
Kyle
We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
Scott
How do you know?
Kyle
'Cause, we're his friends.
Scott
Thennn why are you telling me?
Kyle
'Cause we hate him.
Scott
Oh.
Kyle
Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
Scott
See ya. [the doorbell rings. Scott walks over to open the door]
At the front door
Cartman
[with tickets in hand] Hello, Scott!
Scott
Hey.
Cartman
I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides. [shows him the face of the ticket] Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
Scott
Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.
Cartman
[getting smug] Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
Scott
Wow, a pony ride. Neat.
Cartman
Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.
Scott
Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?
Cartman
[under his breath] A little penis-biting, perhaps?
Scott
What?
Cartman
Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
Scott
How can I turn it down?
Cartman
Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. [Scott turns around and closes the door] Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. [leaves]
back in the living room
Scott
Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned.
Mrs. Tenorman
Oh dear.
Scott
Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.
Mr. Tenorman
[drops his paper. Both parents rise] Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter.
Mrs. Tenorman
We sure can.
Scott
Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.
Mrs. Tenorman
[hugs him] Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you.
Scott
I'm proud of you, too, Mom.
Mrs. Tenorman
Let's go, hon. [heads for the door]
Mr. Tenorman
Let's. [follows her out]
In the kitchen. Scott is cooking up something... his friends arrive
Buddy 1
What are you doing, Scott?
Scott
What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
Buddy 2
[holds out a bag full of hair] We got everyone we could find to chip in. [his friend giggles] There are pubes from just about every single kid in town.
Scott
Awesome! [yanks the bag away, opens it, and mixes the pubes into the chili]
Buddy 1
Oh, dude!
Scott
The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
Buddy 2
Yeah! [hi-fives Scott, and the three laugh heartily]
South Park, next day. The Chili Con Carnival is in full swing. People have already arrived. Stan and Kyle walk up
Cartman
[steps out of the ticket booth to greet them] Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
Stan
This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
Cartman
[smug] Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!
Kyle
Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. [looks at Stan, who's smiling]
Cartman
What's so funny?
Stan
Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?
Cartman
Not yet, but they will be.
Kyle
Yeah, sure. [As Chef arrives, Stan and Kyle leave]
Chef
Hello, Eric!
Cartman
Hey, Chef.
Chef
I made some chili to enter into the contest.
Cartman
What contest?
Chef
This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?
Cartman
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
Chef
It's my special recipe.
Cartman
[seeing Scott, interrupts. Slowly and sweetly] Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! [Scott holds a small container of chili]
Scott
Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything.
Cartman
[overjoyed] Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
Scott
Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
Cartman
Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
Scott
Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
Cartman
[sighs silently] Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first. [Scott leaves] Goddamnit!
Cartman's house, the judging table. Cartman and Scott take their seats. Behind Scott stand Butters, Kyle, Stan, and Scott's friends. Behind Cartman stand Bebe, Clyde, and Token
Scott
[setting his plate before Cartman] Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?
Cartman
[inspecting the dish] Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. [hands his plate to Scott, who takes it to his end of the table and starts eating]
Scott
Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.
Cartman
Alright. [takes the dish and starts eating. Both boys munch away for a few moments] Hey, this is great! [Stan and Kyle stifle giggles]
Scott
Eh, it's a special recipe.
Cartman
[begins to wolf down the food] Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
Scott
I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you.
Cartman
What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? [Everyone at Scott's end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation]
Scott
What?!
Cartman
Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. [Chef looks like he's been used] It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. [Stan and Kyle are stunned] I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. [A shot of Cartman telling Denkins of such a thing. Denkins is armed] I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. [A shot of Scott talking with his parents] And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. [The Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the "starving" pony, but upon seeing Mr. Tenorman's lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them, and they go down]
Mr. Denkins
[looks of horror surround him] Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights.
Scott
My... mom and dad are... dead? [A shot of Officer Barbrady taking a report from Denkins]
Cartman
I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... [A shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away. The pony munches at some grass] After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. [more faces of horror behnd Cartman] Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? [A gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."
Scott
[looks at Cartman for a while, realizing what's just happened] Oh my God! [gagging, he fishes through the plate and finds his mom's wedding ring, still on her finger. He tosses it away] Oh my God!! [vomits off to the side]
Cartman
[leaping up on the table and sings] Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are way stunned]
Stan
Jesus Christ, dude!
Scott
[grief-stricken, he buries his face on the table] My mom and dad are dead! [pounds the table] No! NOOO!! [Radiohead arrives and stands behind Scott. Stan notices]
Thom
Uhm, excuse me?
Stan
Who are you?
Johnny
We're that band, Radiohead.
Scott
[raises his head] Jesus!
Ed
Jeez, what a li'l crybaby!
Colin
Are you gonna cry all day, crybaby??
Thom
You know, everyone has problems; it doesn't mean you have to be a little crybaby about it.
Ed
Come om, guys, let's go. This kid is totally not cool. [the members of the band start leaving]
Thom
Yeah, that's the most uncool kid I've ever met.
Phil
Little crybaby!
Scott
[gathers himself and looks] No, wait! Waaiittt!! Oh my God, Oh my Gaawwwd!! [buries his face in the table and bawls again] Noooo!
Cartman
[walks over to Scott's end of the table] Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott! [starts licking Scott's tears off his face] Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
Kyle
Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
Stan
Good call.
Cartman
Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness! My-yummy. [licks the tears off the table and off Scott's face.] Mm-yummy you guys! [the iris common to Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons appears, with fanfare] Yuppitibut, that's all, folks! [waves]
End of Scott Tenorman Must Die

Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow
Cartman's house, day. Cartman and his friends sit on the sofa watching TV
Announcer
[voice only] And so, in her career filled with lies, backstabbing, and whoring herself for money, [shot of the TV, with the camera panning up to reveal Punky Brewster sitting in a director's chair] she learned that the price of fame can be pleasing 65 men at once in a dark, dirty alley. [image of Punky makes room for the show's logo on the right side] And so ends "Punky Brewster, Behind The Blow."
Cartman
Whoa, bummer, dude.
Kyle
Okay, dude, it's 3:30. [Cartman changes the channel]
Announcer 2
[Shot of TV as "The Terrance & Phillip Show" begins] It's time for the Terrance & Phillip Show!
The Boys
Yay!
Phillip
Excuse me, buddy.
Terrance
Why, did you fart? [farts] Oh, no! [both laugh]
Stan
Oh man, this is another rerun.
Cartman
Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
Kyle
Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
Phillip
I'm looking for a mechanic. Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage?
Terrance
Sure, buddy! All you need to do is go down to the [faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaart. Whatever Terrance is saying is drowned out by the fart], and that's how you [boys join in] get to the auto garage!
Phillip
Can you tell me how to get to the auto garage without farting?
Terrance
Sure. You go the same way [Kyle chimes in] except stick your finger up your ass.
Phillip
No no no! I mean, could you tell me the directions again without you farting?
Terrance
OOOH! Sure! Just stick your finger up my ass.
Phillip
Alright, no problem, buddy. [Terrance lowers his pants enough to show his ass; Phillip sticks his finger in there] Now, tell me: How do I get to the auto garage to see a mechanic?
Terrance
[now wearing a mechanic's hat] You're at the auto garage. I am the mechanic.
Phillip
Why the heck didn't you tell me you were the mechanic?
Stan
Because I had an itch up my ass.
Terrance
Because I had an itch up my ass. [the two laugh, then the boys laugh, then the laughter dies down. Terrance farts again, and they both laugh as the camera's iris shuts slowly.]
Cut to next scene, where they are working on toilet plumbing
Terrance
Terrance & Phillip will be right back...
Phillip:
...after these messages. [toilet water erupts from the toilet and blows them off camera]
Cut to Cartman's living room
Stan
When are they gonna make new ones?
Announcer 3
[On TV, "HEY KIDS!!," white on green, appears and gets bigger, then dances on a blinking background] Hey kids, don't miss the greatest event of the year! This Thursday night at the Denver Coliseum, see Terrance and Phillip LIVE! And in person! ["Terrance and Phillip LIVE! And in person" appears, then Terrance and Phillip flank the text on either side]
Stan
What's this?
Announcer 3
[scenes from various episodes appear] One night and one night only, see all your favorite Terrance and Phillip bits live! [Kenny starts babbling incoherently]
Kyle
Oh my God!
Cartman
[running in circles] You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
Stan
Enough! I know!
Announcer
To order tickets, call TicketSlave NOW!! [a crawl at the bottom of the screen, black on red, reads "CALL NOW! 555-TIXS"]
Kyle
Write the number down! Write the number down!!
South Park Elementary, day. Class is ready to start, the kids are in their seats. Kyle rushes to his seat
Stan
Dude! Did you get 'em?
Kyle
I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
Cartman
Awesome! Give me mine! [Kyle gives them out]
Butters
Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
Stan
Yep. Tomorrow night.
Ms. Choksondik
[enters and goes before the chalkboard] Alright, children, let's settle down. As you know, this coming Friday is Earth Day. [writes it on the board] and I'm pleased to announce that the national Earth Day organization has chosen South Park as its location for the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival.
Class
Oohh.
Ms. Choksondik
The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it. [moves aside for the heads. Two men and a woman come in, each of them sporting a bow on the left lapel.]
Older man
Hello children, I know you're all very excited about having the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival put on in your town.
Younger man
[slowly waves his left forearm in a broad arc, to the left, palm out] You care very much about the earth, don't you?
Class
Yes.
Older man
Good, because it's up to all of you to get lots of people to come.and make it look great. The festival is on Friday, so we'll start getting it ready tomorrow night. [the boys stir and the camera closes in]
Kyle
What??
Younger man
We've all gotta pitch in.
Stan
Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
Cartman, Kyle, Kenny
Yeah.
Older man
You... what??
Kyle
Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
Older man
And Terrance and Phillip are more important than Mother Earth?
Cartman
Well yeah, dude.
Older man
[slowly waves his left forearm in a broad arc, to the left, palm out] You don't care about Terrance and Phillip. [the boys stare back] Nothing matters more than saving the planet from Republicans. [draws close and repeats the arm movement] You don't need to see Terrance and Phillip.
Stan
No, dude, we really, really do.
Older man
[to the woman at his left, whispers] Their will is strong.
Ms. Choksondik
I'm sorry, boys, but nothing's more important than Earth Day.
Kyle
[fielding] Uhuh, but that's why we're going.
Stan
Huh?
Kyle
See, w-we're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club. A- and... we're... going to see them tomorrow 'cause we can get them to perform at the Earth Day festival.
Younger man
You can get Terrance and Phillip to perform? [to the older man] That would be great. Terrance and Phillip would draw huge ratings from children all over the country.
Older man
Very well, kids; we'll work on getting the event ready here, and you go get Terrance and Phillip.
The Boys
All right!
Older man
[ominously] But I warn you: You'd better not promise things to Earth Day people that you can't deliver. Earth Day people can be... eheheh very unforgiving.
Kyle
[the boys look sufficiently scared] Heheh, heh, no problem, heh. No problem!
Denver Coliseum, the following night. The place is packed and music plays in the background. The boys all sport their Terrance and Phillip shirts, as do some other kids.
Announcer
Ladies and gentlemen! [the kids cheer and hoot. Spotlights wash over the audience, their beams moving around aimlessly] Put your hands together for... Terrance! [only one spotlight remains on, illuminating the mic, and the music cuts off]
Terrance
[approaches the mic from behind the curtains] Hellooo, Den-ver! [the roar of the audience fades quickly as they see only Terrance there, and he's not quite himself. A smattering of applause follows]
Kyle
Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.
Stan
Yeah, he looks terrible.
Terrance
How are we all feeling tonight? Pretty good? Uh oh. [Terrance farts and the audience claps awkwardly] Hey, do you all remember this one? "Doctor, doctor. I think I cracked my ass." "Reallih? Let me take a look." "Look closer." [farts, and laughs]
Stan
Uuuuhh.
Cartman
Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
Cartman, Kyle
Phil-lip!
Audience
Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip! Phil-lip!
Terrance
["Phil-lip! Phil-lip!"] And now, for some classic Terrance and Phillip comedy! [the crowd cheers and music plays a bit]
Phillip Stand-in
Hello Terrance.
Terrance
Hello Phillip.
Stan
Phillip? That's not Phillip.
Terrance
Say, Phillip, I have a question for you.
Phillip Stand-in
Ho-okay, shoot. [bends down to receive the fart. Terrance bends over and farts on "Phillip's" face. They both laugh]
Kyle
Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
Cartman
I think this new guy's funny.
Terrance
And now here's a classic Terrance and Phillip sketch that I wrote back in '62. [he and his partner pull out top hats]
Phillip Stand-in
Excuse me, sir. Do you know Who farted?
Terrance
He sure did.
Phillip Stand-in
What's the person's name?
Terrance
Who.
Phillip Stand-in
The guy that farted!
Terrance
Who!
Phillip Stand-in
The person that passed gas!
Terrance
Who passed gas!
Phillip Stand-in
Now, why are you asking me?
Terrance
That's the man's name?
Phillip Stand-in
That's Who's name?
Terrance
Yes!
Phillip Stand-in
Something very terrible has happened in the world of Terrance and Phillip, and we've got to find out what.
Phillip Stand-in
Look, buddy, all I'm trying to find out is What's the guy's name that farted?
Terrance
Right, the guy that drank his own urine.
Phillip Stand-in
Who?
Denver Coliseum, later. Stan and his friends walk down the corridors backstage, heading to Terrance's dressing room
Stan
Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this. [they reach the dressing room, but a bouncer stands in the way] 'Scuse us.
Bouncer
Where do you think you're going?
Kyle
We have to talk to Terrance.
Bouncer
Hyeah, right.
Stan
It's okay. We're the official presidents of the Terrance and Phillip fan club.
Bouncer
Then get in the "Official Presidents of the Terrance and Phillip Fan Club" line. [points to the line, which has a lot more kids waiting to see Terrance. The boys turn to see...]
Cartman
Aw, dude, gay!
Stan
You don't understand! We saved Terrance and Phillip's lives once.
Bouncer
You and about a thousand other people at one time or another. Now, get out of my face! [the boys head for the end of the line]
Cartman
Racist! [a boy wearing glasses watches the foursome approach. The boys fall in]
Stan
Man, this sucks!
Boy in glasses
[quite timidly] Are you guys official presidents, too?
Cartman
Don't talk to us, kid.
Kyle
Hey! Look at that line! [a post next to it reads "FEMALE GROUPIES AND OTHER RANDOM SLUTS" An obese woman stands last in line] It's way shorter.
Stan
I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
Cartman
Kenny's a random slut. [a look of anger flashes across Kenny's face]
Kyle
Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on. [moves to the other line. His friends follow.] Sshh. [stretches the fat woman's pants enough so that all four of them climb in and disappear under her fat]
Terrance's dressing room. He and a groupie are making out on the sofa, both moaning.
Terrance
Mmm. Mmm, yummy. [spanks her twice] Mmm. [they separate a bit]
Groupie
It was so great meeting you. I feel like we really shared something.
Terrance
We sure did, baby. [stands her up quickly and she looks back, disappointed in his reaction] Next? [the obese woman comes in happily]
Obese Woman
[voice trembling] Hello Terrance. I'm such a huuuge fan.
Terrance
You're a huge fan alright!
Obese Woman
Can I just have you sign my breasts?
Terrance
But what do I get in return?
Obese Woman
Whatever you want. [starts making out with him]
Terrance
Oh yeah. [lays down on the sofa, under her] Oh, that's good, baby.
Obese Woman
Oh, Terrance, I love you.
Terrance
You like that? [the woman unzips his pants, then her own]
Obese Woman
I love you! [coitus ensues]
Terrance
Yeah.
Obese Woman
I LOVE you!
Terrance
Ah good.
Obese Woman
I LOVE YOU!!
Terrance
Yeah-
Both
[reaching climax] OH!!! [Cartman leaps out the back of the woman's pants]
Cartman
Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! [Terrance and the woman stand up]
Terrance
Jesus Christ! That was fast! Well, what should we name it? How about Jerry?
Obese woman
What the hell? [the other three boys climb out]
Terrance
Oh wow! We had quadruplets! [the woman throws up her arms and runs out screaming]
Stan
We're not quadruplets, Terrance. We snuck in that woman's spandex to get in here.
Terrance
Oh! Thank God. The last thing I need is more kids. [gets a pen and paper] What do you want, an autograph or something?
Kyle
Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
Terrance
Earth Day, huh? That sounds like a very noble cause. How much does it pay?
Stan
But where's Phillip?
Terrance
[crosses his arms and looks mad] Who?
Kyle
Phillip, your partner.
Terrance
Why is it that every time somebody sees me they have to say, "Hey, where's Phillip?" Like we're freaking married or something! You know, I'll let you tater-tots in on a little secret: Phillip is a HACK! [shot of the boys listening] You know who wrote all the Terrance and Phillip stuff? ME! Phillip never did anything but read his lines!
Kyle
But the guy who replaced him sucks!
Terrance
Ah, I know. [sulks away from the sofa] I know he sucks [walks to his dresser and mirror. The boys are seen in the reflection] To be honest, things haven't been going so well lately. I'm not making any money because everyone wants to see Phillip. Why? What the hell does Phillip do?
Stan
Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.
Terrance
Ogh, whatever. [turns around to face the boys] The point is, Phillip and I are through. [wistfully] And apparently, so is the act. And so is the money.
Stan
What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
Terrance
HA! Goood luck getting Phillip! He left because he wanted to do [does a quote with his index and middle fingers from both hands] "more serious" stuff. Last I heard, he was doing Canadian Shakespeare in Toronto.
Kenny
(Toronto?)
Kyle
[pleading] But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
Terrance
Well, in that case, I'd say you four boys are up Fart Creek without a paddle. [the boys look at each other in dismay]
"South Park: Home of Earth Day Celebration 2001," day. Booths are being set up for the festival. The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival make their rounds
Older man
[through a bullhorn] Work! Work, children! We only have two more days until Earth Day! Work!
Clyde
Ah, excuse me? My daddy is a geologist and he says there actually isn't any concrete evidence of global warming.
Older man
That's not true. [waves his right forearm slowly to the right, palm out] Global warming is going to kill us all. [repeats the arm movement] The Republicans are responsible.
Clyde
Thank you. [turns and returns to work. Stan and friends come in from the other direction and stop at a sign announcing Terrance and Phillip: "TERRANCE & PHILLIP As Promised By KYLE AND HIS FRIENDS"]
Stan
Oh no, dude.
Older man
[arriving with his assistants] Oh, there you are, boys. I need Terrance and Phillip's information so I can tell them their schedule.
Kyle
Uuuh, we didn't get them.
Older man
[gravely] You what?
Stan
They're not together anymore, dude.
Younger man
You'd better be joking. We've already announced their participation.
Kyle
Look, we could we could probably get Terrance, but he'll be performing with this other guy.
Older man
You promised us Terrance and Phillip! We therefore promised the WORLD Terrance and Phillip! You WILL get us Terrance and Phillip, or else!
Stan
But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
Older man
Then you'd better get your asses to Canada and GET him. We'll make travel arrangements. [the three of them start to move away] Nothing is more important than the environment, boys. Not even your lives. [leaves]
Kyle
Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
Cartman
Weak.
Phillip
Ahhh [leaps on his rival, and both lose their swords. The two scuffle on the floor for a few seconds. Phillip's rival fends him off, but Phillip picks up the rival's sword and wounds him with it. We soon learn this is Act 5, Scene 2 of the play, the finale. And so...]
King Claudius
Part them; they are incensed.
Hamlet
[Phillip] Nay, come, again.
Queen Gertrude
Aaaah! [falls]
Osric
[steps forth.] Look to the queen there, buddih! [Hamlet looks over his left shoulder]
Horatio
They bleed on both sides. [Hamlet goes to check on the Queen] How is it, my lord?
Osric
How is't, Laertes?
Laertes
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
Hamlet
How does the queen?
King Claudius
Hey guy, she swounds to see them bleed, buddih. [in the audience Stan and Kyle sigh deeply and Kenny plays with a toy plane, Cartman is asleep]
Queen Gertrude
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. Blagh! [dies]
Hamlet
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:Treachery! Seek it out.
Laertes
[genuflects next to the poisoned sword] It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour of life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
Hamlet
[picks up the poisoned sword] The point!--envenom'd too! Then, venom, to thy work, buddih! [Stabs King Claudius]
All
Treason! treason!
King Claudius
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
Hamlet
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother.
King Claudius
Blagh! [dies]
Laertes
He is served;It is a poison temper'd by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me. Blagh! [dies]
Hamlet
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee, guy. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, buddih, That are but mutes or audience to this act, [chuckles] Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you, buddih--But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest, guy; report me and my cause aright, to the unsatisfied. [chuckles]
Horatio
Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left, buddih.
Stan
Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? [Kenny continues playing with his plane]
Hamlet
...he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Blagh. [dies]
Horatio
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest, buddih!...
The parking lot. The play has ended. Phillip reaches his car with square tires. Stan and the boys chase him down
Stan
[reaching Phillip] Phillip! Phillip!
Phillip
Yes?
Stan
Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
Phillip
Oh, really? This run of Hamlet is closing down, I'm afraid. We could take it there.
Stan
[stammering] Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
Phillip
AH! Stop right there! I'm not doin' nothin' with that fatass egomaniac!
Stan
But we need you!
Phillip
Ah, I'm sick of him taking credit for all the work and not letting me change the act. It's old and stale! I mean, do you really think that fart jokes are funny for that long? [farts and laughs despite himself]
Cartman
Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
Phillip
Yeah, whatever, kid.
Stan
He'll do it, dude.
Kyle
Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
Phillip
What?
The other boys
What?
Kyle
They told us that "Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day."
Phillip
Really? Well that sounds interesting. How much does it pay?
Stan
Two thousand dollars.
Phillip
[opens the driver-side door] I'm in! Here, call me at this number with the details. [hands Stan a business card] Gotta run! [peels away]
Stan
Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
Kyle
I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
Cartman
Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
Kyle
[silent for a bit, then] Ih-it'll be okay.
South Park, day. The kids put finishing touches on the various booths. The heads of the Earth Day Brainwashing Festival make their rounds again
Older man
[through a bullhorn] Work faster! Faster, children! Earth Day is coming! [they approach and ascend a stage set up for Terrance and Phillip. Stan and friends are already there, waiting] Well, boys, it's rehearsal time, and your Terrance and Phillip haven't shown up.
Kyle
They said they'd come.
Stan
I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
Older man
[moves to stand behind the boys with his assistants flanking him] Maybe you kids don't understand how important Earth Day is for the future of our planet. Maybe you need some convincing. Carl? [the younger man, now known as Carl, takes an Earth Day meat cleaver and chops off Kenny's left hand]
Kenny
(AAAAHH!)
Stan
Oh my God!
Phillip
[arriving] Excuse me, is this where the Earth Day crap is happening?
Kyle
He's here! [Stan and Cartman smile]
Older man
Oh. Very good. Mr. Phillip, I am Jack Farliss, head of the Earth Day Committee. Thank you for being part of this important event.
Phillip
Whatever. Where's my check? [Terrance enters from the other side of the stage.]
Terrance
Alright, I'm here. Where do I-?
Phillip
[angrily] What's HE doing here?
Jack
Alright, let's do a rehearsal so that the camera crew can get a look at it. [a zoom-out shows Terrance and Phillip facing away from each other]
Kyle
Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
Stan
Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
Phillip
So, this is your dong, huh, Terrance?!
Terrance
My doing?? These kids called me and said it was your idea and that you wanted to apologize.
Kyle
Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day. [moves his left forearm, palm out, from right to left] You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
Phillip
Well, what the hell? I already flew all the way out here. But I want my check made out to me, not both of us!
Terrance
Ditto!
Stan
Fine! [the boys leave the stage]
Kyle
See? I told you it would work. [the boys take their places before the committee]
Jack
Alright, we'll come off the speech about the dying whales, and thennn, action!
Terrance
Doctor, doctor, I've cracked my ass.
Phillip
Really? Let me take a look.
Terrance
Look closer. [poots]
Kyle.
[encouraging, claps] Haha, hahahaha. Hahaha.
Phillip
Yon fart doth smell of elderberry sweet. Thou dost protes-
Terrance
[interrupts] Uh. What? That's not the line, asshole!
Phillip
You're right. It's a better one, asshole!
Terrance
Just do the bit right, dickface!
Phillip
Why don't you go eat some more pudding, you fatass drug addict?!
Terrance
I may be fat but at least I didn't get hair plugs!
Phillip
That's it! I ain't doin' nothin' with Kuko the Whale!
Terrance
I never needed you in the first place, yuh hack! [moves off the stage, left]
Kyle
You can't leave! The show starts soon!
Jack
Boys, you've got... three hours to get those two back together. Do I need to remind you what will happen if you don't? Carl! [Carl pulls out the cleaver again and chops off Kenny's right hand.]
Kenny
(OOOWWW!)
Kyle
You bastards!
Jack
Good luck, boys. [He, Carl, and the woman walk away. The boys move towards Kenny]
Cartman
We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
South Park, later. Media has come in to cover the event: "Terrance & Phillip Earth Day Brainwashing Festival"
Reporter
[a woman on stage sings and plays a guitar] Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where Earth Day 2001 is in full force. [one shot of the booths] Environmental awareness games, booths, and of course, [a shot of more booths] the entertainment on stage, which is being broadcast live all over the country. This eco-happy crowd is thrilled and waiting in anticipation for the arrival of Terrance and Phillip, who are promised by these four boys. [an inset of the boys appears over the reporter's left shoulder]
Jack
[takes the mic as the singer leaves] What a touching and true song. You know, it's true. [sweeps his left forearm, palmout, from right to left] Republicans are ruining the earth.
Crowd
[repeating] Republicans are ruining the earth.
Jack
Alright. Well, I think I know why most of you tuned in today. How about some Earth Day entertainment?! [the crowd cheers and claps. Jack gives the mic to Kyle and walks off. Stan has left the stage]
Kyle
Hooray for the earth! We must protect it. [the crowd nose dies down] And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! [Stan hands a tape to a camera man, who puts it into a VCR and starts it.]
Carl
On video? [the curtains part on stage, revealing "EARTH DAY 2001"]
Narrator
They were considered the best comedy act in all of Canada. [a shot of the duo, then another of them with Tony Orlando and Dawn] But a fast-paced rocket ride to success would bring them to the depths of despair. [a shot of Terrance, slumped over his couch, then of the show's logo, with vigorous music] This is Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow.
Crowd
Wow!
Carl
[approaching the boys] What the hell do you call this?! [Jack and the woman show up]
Kyle
Eh it's "Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow." I taped it last month.
Jack
We promised people Terrance and Phillip, not a video documentary! You've ruined the earth for the last time, boys! [Carl wields the cleaver one more time, and it reads "Earth Day Cleaver 2001." The boys make a run for it]
The Boys
Aaaahh! [they run behind the crowd as the committee pursues them]
Narrator
[the show resumes] Terrance was born Terrance Henry Stoot, in the small Canadian village of Toronto. [shown with his parents. Mom is a Mountie, Dad seems to be a lumberjack] At a very early age his parents noticed an uncanny musical ability and decided to enroll him in the Canadian School for gifted babies. [a shot of Terrance playing a xylophone, then of the school building, then of Terrance in a class picture with other toddlers] It was here that he partnered up with Phillip Niles Argyle [soon highlighted], a brash young baby from Montreal. [a shot of a poster announcing their next performance] Together, they performed musical acts that stunned Canadians everywhere. [stock footage of Las Vegas in the 1960s] At the tender age of six, Terrance and Phillip were off to the United States to perform on the Ed Sullivan show [stock footage of the building the show was filmed at]. where American audiences would be exposed to Canadians for the first time.
Ed Sullivan
[arms folded over his chest] And now, ladies and gentlemen, we have two adorable little boys from Canada. Please put your hands together for the music of young Terrance and Phillip. [fanfare, audience claps as the two boys are shown in Canadian Mountie dress. They begin their song and dance]
Terrance & Phillip
Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
Woman
Oh my God, what's wrong with their heads?!
Man
It's alright, darling, they're just Canadian.
Woman
Oooh.
Terrance & Phillip
Beef and lamb, chicken and ham, Step to the left and clap your hands! Gosh we love our chicken and ham. Don't let it go to waste that chicken and ham!
Narrator
The Canadian act confused American audiences. [one person claps. Ed looks disappointed] But then something happened that would change Terrance and Phillip's act forever. [Phillip farts. A man and woman laugh, and soon the audience joins in. Ed claps joyfully as well. The crowd is soon roaring with cheers and then Terrance farts in return. More laughter and cheers] It was the birth of Canadian comedy. [a shot of Terrance and Phillip using their fart routine in their music act, a shot of them with President Gerald Ford] Terrance and Phillip spent the next several years perfecting their art, and meeting some of America's most influential people. [a shot of the audience looking at the video, from the back of the audience]
Phillip
[approaches Mr. Garrison] Excuse me, which way is the bus station? [still mad, carries a suitcase]
Mr. Garrison
Hey, you're the guy on the screen. [points to the stage]
Phillip
What? [looks at the screen]
Narrator
But it was in 1974, on the Sonny & Cher Show, that Terrance and Phillip finally started to mix their Canadian humor with deep political insight. [splashy shots of the Sonny & Cher Show]
Sonny
You know, Cher, a lot of us real Americans don't know much about Canada.
Cher
[garbled somewhat] Well, a lot of us real Americans aren't as stupid and short as you, hm. [the audience laughs]
Sonny
Please put your groovy hands together for the young and talented Terrance and Phillip! [applause and music as the duo come on]
Phillip
Say, Terrance, I'm getting worried aboot all these Russians making missiles. Maybe we should stop this cold war.
Terrance
Here's a missile for ya! [farts in his direction, and they both laugh. The audience laughs along]
Phillip
That's better. [farts on Terrance's face, and they both laugh, and the audience joins in. Terrance farts on Phillip's face and they both laugh. The audience laughs some more. Terrance farts on Cher and Phillip farts on Sonny]
Narrator
With this bold mix of humor and political insight, the world couldn't get enough of Terrance and Phillip. [the shot of Terrance and Phillip with Tony Orlando and Dawn] But their fame would come at a price, when Behind the Blow continues.
South Park Elementary, front. The boys stop there to catch their breaths
Stan
[panting] Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.
Kyle
Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
Cartman
Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
Kyle
I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
Stan
Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
Carl
[off-screen] There they are! [the boys react and are off running]
Kyle
Haaah! [Carl chops off Kenny's left leg to the knee]
Kenny
(Aahhh!)
Stan
Go! Run run run! [Kyle wails, Kenny keeps up somehow]
South Park stage. Behind The Blow continues
Narrator
[a shot of Terrance and Phillip with three Playboy Bunnies] As they entered their late teens, Terrance and Phillip were already starting to taste the sweet milk of success. [a shot of Terrance and Phillip propped up as scarecrows out on a field] But the price of fame was looming, as Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow continues. [a shot of Johnny Carson laughing it up with Terrance and Phillip] The '70s and '80s were a good time for young Terrance and Phillip. [a shot of the Donny and Marie Show with Terrance and Phillip cavorting in the background] Their act on the Donny and Marie Show earned them a Nobel Peace Prize. They were on the cover of every magazine. [The Times, Teen Heat] And then in 1998, even a Saturday morning cartoon was made, based on Terrance and Phillip. [From episode #102, "Terrance and Phillip and the Land of the Goat People." The camera pans an alien landscape, from a star in the sky to a pair of muscular men in spandex space suits] Terrance and Phillip themselves supplied the voices.
Phillip
Say Terrance, what should we do aboot this strange planet we've crashed on?
Terrance
I don't know, Phillip. It looks like the alien species here breathe an inert gas.
Phillip
Oh oh, did you say what I thought you said? [farts, and they both laugh]
Goat leader
[approaches with his tribe] As leader of the goat people, I have seen my species nearly wiped out by your dangerous gas.
Phillip
Wow, that sucks. [he and Terrance laugh. The dialog continues as the narrator speaks]
Narrator
The cartoon was such a huge success that it started to breed confusion over whether Terrance and Phillip were animated characters or real people. And so, in 1998, [a shot of them working on a script] the comedy team started work on what they thought would be their greatest achievement: A made-for-TV movie written by and starring Terrance and Phillip, called "Not Without My Anus." [a shot of the duo on the Metro, then the opening logo is shown, then shots of the episode itself] It was their biggest project to date. But it had the misfortune of being scheduled on a night when a different and more popular show, the John Schneider Variety Hour [a shot of John singing], was supposed to air. When fans tuned in to see John Schneider and instead were treated to the Canadian made-for-TV movie [a clip of Terrance and Phillip on the Metro], they were enraged, bewildered, and scared. [a shot of the HBC building in flames] The fans revolted and burned down the network, killing six television producers and wounding twelve others. [a shot of the dead and wounded, another of rioting] The hatred of Terrance and Phillip had begun. Terrance fell into a deep depression and started abusing wood polish. [Terrance sits slumped over his sofa with a small can of polish at his feet] Phillip beat up an angry six-year-old fan and was sued for six million dollars. It was the first time the duo tasted failure [a shot of teen Terrance and Phillip superimposed on a burning HBC building], and it nearly killed them both.
Terrance
[moves into view, looking at the video] What's going on here? [he's behind and next to Mr. Mackey]
Mr. Mackey
Sh. We're watching "Behind the Blow," m'kay.
South Park. The boys run past Tom's Rhinoplasty, with the Earth Day Committee in hot pursuit
Stan
Come on, Kenny, hurry up!
South Park stage. Behind The Blow continues. A shot of Mr. Garrison and Phillip
Narrator
[a shot of Terrance on a yellow sofa, drunk and unkempt, attempting to hammer himself to death] After years of depression and suicide attempts, Terrance and Phillip finally decided to get together [another shot of them working on a script] for one last film: [a poster for Asses of Fire is shown, then the camera zooms on on the duo in the car] the 1999 hit, Asses of Fire. It was one of the highest-grossing films of the summer. [shots of the duo singing and dancing in the street, during "Uncle Fucka"] And though the film also started the Canadian-American War of 1999 [shots of the war], in which eight million people lost their lives, the film was considered a great success. [a shot of Terrance and Phillip holding an Oscar] After almost being executed by the American government [a shot of the attempted execution], Terrance and Phillip were eventually returned to Canada [they are shown getting off the plane, with the captain waving at them from behind], where they were touted as heroes. [a shot of Phillip looking at the video] They have been to hell and back, through the very best and the very worst of times, together, but they had seen it through. [a shot of the duo being hoisted above the crowd, Terrance holding a golden cup.] And so ends Terrance and Phillip, Behind the Blow. [the audience cheers and claps. Terrance walks up to Phillip, still with suitcase]
Phillip
Terrance...
Terrance
Oh, Phillip. You're still here, too.
Phillip
I was just watching this video, I ah-. You know, I've never seen it before.
Terrance
[pause] Me neither.
Phillip
[pause] We sssure did go through a lot together.
Terrance
We sure did.
Phillip
[drops the suitcase and makes a move] Terrance, I-
Terrance
No. No, Phillip, don't say it. I was an asshole, and this is mostly my fault.
Phillip
That's what I was gonna say: You were an asshole, and this is mostly your fault. [awkward pause] But, you were always the more artistically driven of us; I ssshould've put more into it than I did. [now dejected]
Terrance
No, Phillip, I really thought I did everything. Until I- tried to do it alone. [now dejected. Phillip farts long and soft. A few laughs roll out of Phillip, then out of Terrance, and pretty soon they're laughing it up as they always do. The Earth Day committee approaches the boys, who have made it back to the festival]
Jack
Think of all the endangered species that will now vanish because of you! Carl! [Carl chops off Kenny's right leg with the cleaver]
Kenny
(AH how!) [topples over and away from the committee. Large amounts of blood quickly pour out]
Jack
So long, boys! [he and the other two start to move off]
Kyle
Wait! dude, LOOK! [the audience cheers as Terrance and Phillip take the stage]
Terrance
Thank you everyone, thank you! You know, Phillip and I have learned an important lesson: that when you go through a lot with somebody, you can't let trite things come between you.
Phillip
That's right, Terrance. You should only let trite things come between your asscheeks [both fart]
Terrance
Ohohoho, nohoho! [both of them laugh]
Stan
They're back!
Cartman
Alright!
Jack
Yes! Earth Day is saved, boys! Everything worked out after all!
Stan
It sure did.
Cartman
[rolling Kenny over so he can see] Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!
Kenny
(Oh, well now that's sweet.)
Phillip
Say Terrance, can you tell me Who farted? [the camera pulls out as the skit continues]
Terrance
He sure did, Phillip.
Phillip
NO, I'm asking you his name!
Narrator
And so, Terrance and Phillip got back together, proving once and for all that fame and fortune are never as important as friendship.
End of Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow

Cartmanland
A bright, sunny day, with some clouds in the sky. The camera pans down to a funeral scene in a cemetery with robust trees
Priest
...And so it is with heavy hearts that we say good-bye to Mabel Louise Cartman. [a shot of the entire Cartman family, with a few new faces. Cousin Alexandra wears a veil over her face] She was a good woman, a community leader, a caring wife, a providing mother [a shot of Liane, teary-eyed], and a loving grandmother [a shot of Eric checking his watch]
Cartman
Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
Liane
Ssshhh, pumpkin, it's almost over.
Cartman
Why couldn't the funeral have been on a school day?
Priest
And now, let us bow our heads in a moment of silence and reflect on how Mabel touched our lives. [all close their eyes]
Cartman
[softly] God! She didn't take this long to die.
Priest
And now we release the doves to symbolize the Lord taking Mabel into his arms and giving her everlasting peace. [a blonde assistant lifts the cage door cheerfully, then strains to hear some noise. She lifts the cage only to see the dead doves tumble out onto the grass]
Assistant
[serenely] Peace. [music plays and everyone disperses]
Cartman
Great. Now can we go?
Liane
No, sweetie, we have to tend to some of Grandma's business.
Cartman
Ogh! God-damnit..!
The city, day. Johnson's & Associates Law Firm.
Executor
[reads will] ..."And so I leave my stocks and bonds, worth an estimate fourteen dollars and twelve cents, to be divided amongst my loving family."
Cartman
[impatient, arms crossed] Mom, I wanna go home!
Liane
In a minute, sweetie. This is important.
Executor
"To my loving son, Stinky: I leave you the house in Nebraska. Look after it as your father and I did."
Cartman
Bluh bluh bluhbluh bluh bluh...
Executor
"To my grandson Eric: You are always my favorite fat little man, my perfect round little pudding-piler."
Cartman
[under his breath] Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
Executor
"For you, Eric, I leave from my life savings, the sum of one million dollars, to be transferred to you immediately."
Cartman
[stunned] Hoosajiggawha?
Liane
A million dollars?
Executor
"Eric is the primary benefactor of my estate, since it is likely the rest of you would spend the money on crack."
Liane
Oh my.
Uncle Stinky
That can't be!
Cartman
Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
Executor
Yes, Eric, it's yours.
Cartman
No, no, wait, you don't understand. [voice trembles] since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...
Executor
And now, you do.
Cartman
Egh... [lets out four long screams while his family watches]
South Park, day. A car with a woman seated in it appears on a hill
Stan
"There you are, Jennifer Lopez!" [Stan's face appears, and it's instantly clear that the car and Lopez are dolls] "You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez."
Kyle
"No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!"
Stan
"It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez." [inserts a small firework next to Lopez in the tiny car]
Kyle
"Have mercy!" [Stan lights the firework. He and Kyle move away. The firework pops and the little car flips over] Yeah ha ha!
Stan
Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guys! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
Stan
...Why?
Kenny
(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
Kyle
Nuh uh.
Kenny
(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)
Stan
You'd better not be lying, Kenny. [the three walk out of view.]
South Park, the Bank, later. Inside, a banker counts the money out in $100 bills. Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria, Chef, and others are there.
Banker
Nine hundred ninety nine thousand four hundred, nine hundred ninety nine thousand five hundred...
Jimbo
Damn, Ned, I've never seen that much cash.
Ned
Mm-me neither.
Banker
...Nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred, one million. [sets the last bill and moves the stack next to the other stacks.]
Cartman
[softly] Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.
Mr. Garrison
Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
Cartman
I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
Jimbo
On what?
Cartman
On my dream. [zoom in] On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
South Park, the Bank, outside. Cartman leads the others out of the bank and down the street. The money is in his Radio Flyer wagon
Broker
[seen in the crowd, pops up next to Cartman] Excuse me son, I'm an investment broker; I can help you invest that money.
Cartman
Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
Priest Maxi
Eric, God could sure use that money for a bigger church.
Cartman
Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
Kyle
What the hell are you doing, fatass?!
Cartman
Not much, just taking my [stops the wagon and shows a stack of bill off] one million dollars out of the bank. [the other three boys are stunned]
Stan
Oh my God.
Kyle
Kenny wasn't lying.
Cartman
Would you mind stepping aside? I have a purchase to make.
Stan
Dude, can you loan me twenty bucks for a new jacket?
Cartman
HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
Kyle
Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
Cartman
Didn't earn it?! What about all the years I spent making Grandma like me?! All the wet spit-filled kisses I put up with?! The constant smell of aspirin and pee?! Don't tell me I didn't earn it, you son of a bitch!
Kyle
No... No, this isn't possible.
Stan
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
Kyle
No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
Stan
Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. [walks away, but Kyle stays behind, in doubt]
Kyle
Why? How could you do this? There are people starving in Alabama and... and you give Cartman a million dollars?
North Park Funland, day. Cartman and his mom are in the park office signing papers
Broker
...Aaand if we can just get you to sign here... [Cartman signs] and here... [Cartman signs].
Liane
Are you sure this is what you want, sweetie?
Cartman
My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
Broker
And now you just sign here, Mr. Fun. [Mr. Fun holds the pen and thinks a bit... a roller coaster zips by outside the window]
Mr. Fun
I can't do it.
Broker
What?
Cartman
What?!
Mr. Fun
Uh uh I can't sell this poor kid my park. [Cartman remains stunned] Look, I haven't been honest with you. The park hasn't been doing great business.
Broker
Frank...
Mr. Fun
Sshhhh. It ain't right, Chris. [to Cartman and Liane] The truth is, the park is a financial flop. I haven't turned a profit in years because I can't keep attendance up.
Cartman
Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
Mr. Fun
You... you're not?
Cartman
No no! I'm buying it to keep people out! [Chris and Frank look at each other] Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks. [zoom in] But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds, [shot of people waiting to enter "The Mine Shaft"] The rides are great, but... [a shot of crowds on Main Street] All the lines, lines, LINES! [shot of people waiting to enter a ghost ride, another shot of a kids' mine shaft ride; another of Cartman pissed off, eyes squeezed shut, with waiting times floating past him] If there's one thing I hate, [a shot of two lines of people entering his head] all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!! [opens his eyes, and a moment later...] And then there get to be so many people [his eyes roll around independently of each other] that they make FastPass. [a shot of people in a FastPass line] So then there's lines for FastPass. [zoom out to show Cartman in line for a FastPass] You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms [two lines for the Waterworks Restrooms], lines for the drinks [Astro Food line], lines for cantakuras [Seussian characters play strange instruments for the people in line] and rare Kartankulas Plinks! [a vendor sells them - they are a fruit treat shaped like strawberries] ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.
Mr. Fun
Nn-oh. Well then, I guess I don't feel bad. [signs the papers]
Chris
[the broker] Mr. Cartman, congratulations, the theme park is yours. [slides the documents to Cartman]
Cartman
Gentlemen, I thank you.
South Park Synagogue, night. A main door opens and Stan enters
Stan
Kyle? [at the front of the synagogue, Kyle sits in the first pew right, and a shaft of moonlight shines down on him from the rose window over the altar. Stan approaches] Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
Kyle
[not turning around, voice quivering] Do you know what happened to me this morning, Stan? This morning... I woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass. I felt down there and, and found this... big sore lump. On my ass, Stan. I couldn't even sit down, so... I, I had to tell my mother, which, which was humiliating. She took me to the doctor, which was more humiliating, a- a- nd he told me. I-I have a hemorrhoid. It's like an infected blood vessel on your ass. I'm nine years old, and I have a hemorrhoid, Stan. I have a hemorrhoid, and, Cartman has his own theme park.
Stan
Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
Kyle
[leaves the pew to face Stan, teary-eyed] Do you?! Do you, Stan?! Because all my life I was raised to believe in Jehovah! To believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us. I make mistakes, but every week I try to better myself. I'm always saying, "You know, I learned something today..." and what does this so-called God give me in return? A hemorrhoid. He doesn't make sense! [to God] What is your logic?! [feels a pang in his ass] Ow. [tends to the pain]
Stan
Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
North Park Funland, day. Cartman is on the Carousel on a white horse, alone
Cartman
[gleefully] Yyeessss! Yyeessss! [next, "Java Jam!!" a Teacup ride. Cartman laughs to himself] Awesome! [continues laughing. Next shot: Cartman in the "Bumper Buggies" bumper cars] Ho ho! [bumps into the car before him] Sweet! [bumps into the car behind him] Yes! [next shot: Cartman announcing at the Mine Shaft Ride] Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft! [pulls the lever and the cars pull away. Cartman rushes to jump in the first car and buckles in. Outside, the cars go to one end of the ride] Yes! [the cars go to the other end of the ride] Yes! [next shot, goes to "Ride Shots: pictures of your ride"] Oh, cool! [a picture of him on the ride appears on one screen] Oh, look how much fun I had! [next shot: a haunted ride. First, a mummy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheheheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Ah! Heheh. [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heh, heheh. [next shot, Cartman on a ferry around an island] Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome! [the island seems to have real animals there, like giraffes, elephants. Next shot, Cartman on a log ride, "The Yeti." He goes down the chute] Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess! [lands in the lake below] Yehess! [comes to the end of the ride, sobs joyfully] I'm so happy! I'm so happy..!
Stan's house. Kyle enters carrying a padded seat ring
Stan
[on the sofa] Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
Kyle
Great. [tosses the ring onto the sofa]
Stan
What's that?
Kyle
It's my seat ring. I have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid. [hops onto the ring] Ow.
Stan
Heh, heh. [Kyle glares at him] Sorry.
Kyle
So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
Stan
Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
Kyle
Hunh, I guess you're right.
Cartman
[voice, from the TV] Hey, everybody! Check out the all new Cartmanland! It's our Graaand Opening! Cartmanland has over a hundred fabulous rides [Cartman stands next to a Yeti. When the log car comes out, he jumps in and takes off], six roller coasters [one of them is shown], and tons of great surprises! [a haunted tree and the Yeti do their stuff. Cartman is back at the front gate] And the best part is: [zoom in] You can't come!! [Stan and Kyle look confused. Next shot: Cartman on Main Street] That's right, because at Cartmanland, only I, Eric Cartman, can get in! That means only I can ride the all-new Tornado Twister [a shot of the fancy new ride, with Cartman in one of the cars, going through the loops], a roller coaster that splashes in the water! Wow! [an overview of Adventure Island, with Cartman showing it off] It's the greatest amusement park in the Colorado area! And nobody can go!! Especially Stan and Kyle!! HAHA!! [a shot of Cartman landing in a space capsule, with parachute] So come on down to Cartmanland now! [Cartman in the Haunted Mansion ride] But don't plan on getting past the parking lot, [back at the front gate] 'cause remember: [cue music] So much to do at Cartmanland, but you can't come! [cut music] Especially you, Stan and Kyle.
Stan
[hops off the sofa and heads for the door] That does it, dude!
Kyle
Where are we going?
Stan
We're getting into that fatass's park whether he likes it or not! [Kyle hops off and takes his seat ring. Both boys leave]
Cartmanland, Haunted Mansion, night. Cartman is back on the ride.
Cartman
[a mommy pops out of a casket to his right] Whoa! Heheh. [a skeleton pops out to his right] Whoa! [a ghost pops on from his left] Whoa! Heheheheheh. [he exits the ride and ambles back to the road] Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
Kyle
[in the distance, while Cartman speaks] Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts! [the sound of chain-link is heard] Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
Cartman
[lifts his hand to his ear to hear better] What the hell?
Kyle
Hohohooho! Oowwww!
Cartman
You sons of bitches! [goes towards the source of the sound]
Cartmanland, perimeter fence. Stan is in the park waiting for Kyle to come down, but Kyle is stranded on top of the fence. The view is from the park towards the parking lot.
Stan
Come on, dude!
Kyle
Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
Cartman
[arriving] What the hell are you doing?!
Stan
Aw, crap.
Kyle
Oh God, get me off of here!! [falls off, but outside the park]
Stan
Dude! [rushes out of the park to Kyle]
Kyle
[now standing, rubbing his ass] Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
Stan
Alright, let's go.
Cartman
[reaches the scene, but stays inside the park] That's right! You stay out!
Stan
You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
Kyle
My life can't get any worse!
Stan
You'll see! We'll get in! [walks off with Kyle as Cartman glares after them.]
Cartmanland, day. Cartman stands at the front gate with a new employee. The entrances are now barricaded with wooden planks. Two remain open: the middle one and the one at far right.
Cartman
...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
Security Guard
So what does does this job pay?
Cartman
Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
Security Guard
Uh, I'm afraid I don't really like rides.
Cartman
[looks warily at the guard] But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
Security Guard
I'm not interested.
Cartman
Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
Security Guard
If you need security, I need a cash salary.
Cartman
But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
Security Guard
Well, look: Why don't you just let a couple of people in each day? Every day you can just let two people in, charge $29.95 per ticket, and then you can use that to pay my daily salary.
Cartman
Ugh... Two people?
Security Guard
This place is huge. You'll never notice two people. And then you'll have security for your park.
Cartman
Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
Security Guard
I will shoot on sight.
Cartman
Sweet.
Hells Pass Hospital, day. Kyle is on a gurney, face down. A doctor stands behind him as his parents look on
Doctor
You're a very lucky little boy. I've never seen a hemorrhoid so infected. It could have killed you. [walks away]
Kyle
Lucky. [the operating room doors open and in walks Stan]
Gerald
Oh, look, Kyle. Your little friend Stan is here to see you.
Stan
Dude, are you okay?
Kyle
Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
Stan
Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
Sheila
Ah-ah-ah-I'm afraid Kyle can't ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid.
Stan
Jesus.
Kyle
But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
Sheila
Kyle, don't say such things!
Kyle
Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
Gerald
Kyle, y-you-you just don't understand. It's--
Kyle
No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God![Stan casts his eyes down] Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
Cartmanland, day. Barbed wire has been placed atop every fence imaginable. A crowd of people shows up. Among the people are Butters, Clyde, Jordan, Bebe...
Cartman
[on the bullhorn] Alright, alright, listen up, people. Cartmanland is open, but only to two people each day. [turns it off]
Kids
Aw.
Boy
That's gay.
Cartman
I just gotta cover my security expenses. Butters, Clyde, you can come in.
Butters
Hoh.
Clyde
Oh. [Cartman moves a post and the two boys walk out. Cartman places the post back]
Cartman
The rest of you will just have to try another day.
Kids
Aw. [they turn around and walk away. Cartman goes to the ticket booth and opens the window. Butters is waiting]
Cartman
'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir. [Butters gives him the money and gets back change, his ticket, and a map of the park] Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
Butters
Hoh boy, oh boy! [Clyde purchases his ticket]
Cartman
...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland. [Clyde leaves] Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides. [walks in and dances down Main Street] Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again! [enters the ride and makes his way through the line] Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah- [finds Clyde and Butters waiting for the ride as well. They turn to see him] What are you doing?
Butters
We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
Cartman
Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? [Clyde and Butters lean away from Cartman, a bit afraid]
Butters
Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. [crosses his arms in disappointment]
Clyde
Yeah! But I think it's broke down. The cars aren't moving.
Cartman
Ugh, alright, alright, hang on. [pulls out a walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Security!
Security Guard
[arrives talking into his own walkie-talkie] What?
Cartman
Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
Security Guard
Uh, I'm security, not maintenance.
Cartman
But I don't know how it works.
Security Guard
Well your rides are gonna break down every now and then. You need to hire a maintenance person.
Cartman
Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
Cartmanland, another day. A crowd of people shows up. Among the people are Bebe, Token, Timmy, Kenny, Filmore...
Cartman
[on the bullhorn] Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day. [a shot of the crowd from the front, then one of Cartman] However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood? [everyone nods] Alright, let's go. [unhinges the velvet rope, and in walk Token, Timmy, Filmore and friend, Kenny, two adults, Bebe, and another boy]
Timmy
Timmay!
Cartman
[eyes the new boy and stops him] Wait a minute! Who are you?
Boy
Mike Gainor. [Cartman sees a bandage on the boy's face and rips it off]
Cartman
HA! Get the hell out of here, Stan!
Stan
Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!
Cartman
I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
Stan
It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
Cartman
Get him out of here! [Stan looks up in surprise]
Security Guard
Move along, sir. [sprays the pepper gas on Stan]
Stan
AGGH! [The guard escorts him away] This isn't over, Cartman!
Cartman
Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides! [smiles and walks into the park. Next shot, Cartman in a roller coaster. Next, Cartman on "Plummet from the Summit"] Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared! [reaches the top of the ride, then the car goes into free fall] AAAGGGHHH....
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. A nurse works on Kyle's hemorrhoid with pincers
Kyle
Agh! [the nurse moves the pincers one way] Agghh! [then another]
Nurse
Just a little more. [one twist more] There we go. [withdraws the pincers. Gerald and Sheila enter Kyle's room with the Bible]
Gerald
Hello, Kyle. How's the hemorrhoid today?
Kyle
[the nurse leaves] Awesome. [Gerald and Sheila take their seats near Kyle]
Sheila
Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It's a story from the Bible.
Kyle
I've had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?
Gerald
Oh, I think you'll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle. [Kyle gets cross, and Gerald corrects himself] Uh, okay. [begins the story. A Middle Eastern scene appears] You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago. [camera pans across the landscape and rests behind a man in a red robe and long gray hair] Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children [they come out of a building with their mother], a wonderful wife, and many friends. [his friends show up to join the family behind Job, a proud and happy man]
Sheila
[a shot of Job petting a bull] He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. [Job brings a bag of food to a woman with three kids next to her. One of them, a girl, walks up, and her mother hands her a loaf of bread]
Gerald
He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. [Job falls to his knees in praise, as his shepherds look on]
Sheila
But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.
Kyle
[still mad] Satan talked to God?
Sheila
Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."
Gerald
But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn't give him those things, he would curse your name."
Sheila
To which God said, "Oh yeah? I'll show you, Satan! I'll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."
Gerald
And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job's oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. [that scene is shown]
Sheila
Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. [meteorites rain down and destroy the fields and workers there, as well as the sheep]
Gerald
And then, as Job's sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. [the palm trees bend low as the winds pick up, then the two-story house collapses as the palm trees are swept away by the winds, and Job's family dies]
Sheila
Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God's name. [Job falls to his knees and prays to God.]
Gerald
So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. [shown, with the burning fields behind him]
Sheila
He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. [another shot of Job among the dead, then a close-up of Job with his sores]
Gerald
God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." [all that is heard after that is the sound of the heart monitor attached to Kyle.]
Kyle
[a few seconds later] And that's it? That's the end?
Sheila
Basically.
Kyle
That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
Gerald
Oh. Uhhh, I don't know.
Kyle
Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
Cartmanland, day. Yet another crowd of people awaits to get in. Cartman greets them
Cartman
[checking off items on a clipboard] ...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day... [the clipboard reads, "Cartmanland Expenses."] Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... [under his breath] God-damnit! [picks up the bullhorn and says] Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! [the crowd hoots and hollers and surges forward, engulfing Cartman. The people rush towards the one open ticket booth]
Clerk
Welcome to Cartmanland.
Hells Pass Hospital, day. The doctor has been in to see Kyle's recovery progress and is now talking to the parents
Sheila
Isn't he getting any better, doctor?
Doctor
I don't understand it. He's not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It's like he... like he's lost all hope. Well if you'll excuse me, I've got more tests to run. [leaves. The TV monitor is seen, with a picture of a financial program]
Announcer
And now back to Money Quest, on HBC.
Host 1
[Camera zooms in on the two hosts] Welcome back to Money Quest. [Kyle looks at the show] In just over two weeks, young financial genius Eric Cartman [his picture appears on the screen behind the hosts] has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands.
Host 2
And the way he did it is with the brilliant "You Can't Come" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing.
Host 1
Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country.
At a restaurant where all the tables are empty and everyone is waiting in line...
Waitress
I'm sorry, we're no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You'll have to leave now.
At the Bijou, where everyone is waiting outside....
Clerk
No, I'm sorry. You can't see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. I can't even go in.
At Gracy's clothing store, a sales associates barks orders...
Associate
[the shoppers rush out of there] Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy's anymore! Get out of here! [kicks the last shopper out]
Back to Money Quest...
Host 1
Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.
Back to Kyle's room at Hells Pass Hospital...
Kyle
Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... [passes out. A flatline appears on the heart monitor]
Sheila
[approaches] Kyle? Kyle? [turns to Gerald] Get the doctor!
Cartmanland, day. Every ride has people on it, and every ride Cartman is on shows a dejected Cartman as the others enjoy themselves. At the Carousel he rides his favorite white horse, but shows no joy in riding it. At Java Jam!!! he's in a purple teacup with three other kids, and is not enjoying it. At Bumper Buggies he's in the #7 bumper car
Cartman
[Bumped from ahead by car #9, Clyde] Eh! [Bumped from ahead by car #4, Kevin] Goddamnit, stop running into me! [at the Mine Shaft Ride he sits in the fist car, but is not enjoying it with all those other kids. Kenny is in the last car]
Kenny
[around one bend] (Woohoo!) [around another] (Heeheehee!!) [he's out of his seat flying with the car, and he gets impaled in the face by a water pipe. It goes along for the ride. Outside, at Ride Shots, the shots from the just-completed ride are shown. Kenny is shown on screen 3 with the pipe buried into his face, which is now unrecognizable. On the steamboat ferry circling Adventure Island Cartman covers his ears and looks around angrily]
Cartman
AGH! [he's next in The Yeti log ride with older kids] DAAGGHHHH!!
Cartmanland, Main Street. The crowds bustle about and business is good. Chris the Broker and Mr. Fun are seen walking down Main Street.
Mr. Fun
My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!
Chris
He sure did!
Mr. Fun
Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like this!
Cartman
[approaches] Hey, there you are! [The two men see him]
Mr. Fun
Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.
Cartman
Just give me my money back.
Mr. Fun
What?
Cartman
I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
Mr. Fun
...But it's doing great!
Cartman
You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
Mr. Fun
[Chris smiles at this turn of events] You bet! I'll go get your money right now. [the men leave]
Boy
[walking along] Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?
Cartman
GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! [scares the hell out of the boy. The father holds on to the boy]
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. The doctor has brought Kyle's vitals back, and Kyle is on oxygen, but he's still unconscious. Gerald and Sheila look on
Gerald
Isn't he responding at all, doctor?
Doctor
[turns around to face them] I'm sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I'm afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he's... he's just... given up on life.
Sheila
But then... are you saying...?
Doctor
There's nothing I can do. Little fella's just... lost his will to live.
Sheila
[walks up to Kyle] Oh Kyle! Kyle, you've got to fight!
Cartmanland... ahem, North Park Funland, day. The old North Park Funland sign is being restored, as are many of the rides Cartman replaced. The ticket booths are missing. A bulldozer sits outside the park ready to clear out anything else that needs removal. Cartman exits with the million dollars he originally paid for the park. The money is back on the Radio Flyer
Cartman
Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! [three men in suits approach Cartman]
Agent
Excuse me? Eric Cartman?
Cartman
[turns to face them] Yeah?
Agent
I'm Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven't kept records of your income or payout, and there's a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy. [to the two other men] Seize the assets. [the men grab the discrepancy]
Cartman
He-hey, that's my money!
Mr. Garrett
There's also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family's entitled to the rest of this. [takes the wagon with the other half million]
Cartman
What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
Mr. Garrett
You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We'll see you in court. [the men walk away with the million]
Cartman
Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
Mr. Garrett
We know how well your park is doing; you'll make it back in no time.
Cartman
No! But I don't... ah... ah... [sees Mr. Fun through a fence and rushes to talk to him] Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
Mr. Fun
Nohoho way, José!
Cartman
But I'm getting sued now. If I don't have the park, I lose everything!
Mr. Fun
"I don't care," said Pierre. "I'm from France." [turns around and disappears into the crowd]
Cartman
This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Stan bursts into Kyle's room
Stan
Kyle, you gotta see!! [the doctor looks at him. Sheila and Gerald turn around]
Sheila
[sadly] Kyle's not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! [weeps into Gerald's chest]
Stan
Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
Doctor
Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I--
Stan
Then damnit man, do it!
North Park Funland, day. The ticket booths are back, and business is as strong now as it was when the park was Cartmanland. Off to the side, Cartman is throwing stones at one of the park walls
Cartman
It isn't fair! [throws another stone] You goddamned assholes, it isn't fair! [throws another. Stan arrives with the doctor, the nurse, Kyle, and Kyle's parents]
Stan
Look, Kyle. Look. [smiles]
Kyle
[opens his eyes] Huh?
Cartman
You just build me up to chop me down, didn't you?! What about my dream?! What about my money?! [throws another stone]
Kyle
[more alert] Huh?
Cartman
I'M SO PISSED OFF! [the security guard arrives, ready to spray Cartman]
Security Guard
Move along, sir! You are vandalizing private property!
Cartman
Ey! You used to work for me! [the guard sprays Cartman in the face] Ut ut aw! Aw, Goddamnit, you sonofabitch! [coughs and wheezes. Stan grins and Kyle's vital stats get stronger. Kyle sighs]
Stan
Kyle!
Doctor
He's coming back.
Sheila
That's it, baby. That's it.
Cartman
Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
Doctor
Wait a minute. Yes! The hemorrhoid is going into remission!
Hemorrhoid
[receding into the colon] Oh, shit!
Stan
Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable. [a shot of Cartman on his knees, sobbing] Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
Cartman
It's not fair! It's not fair; I wanna die! I wanna daaahahie! [Kyle looks at Cartman, then up at the sky, then sits up and removes the oxygen mask]
Kyle
You are up there! [smiles]
End of Cartmanland

Proper Condom Use
South Park, day. A car with a woman seated in it appears on a hill — Jennifer Lopez doll with car, and some damage from the firecracker last time.
Stan
[voice only] "So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!"
Kyle
[face appears] "No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies."
Stan
[face appears] "That's what you said last time [pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket], but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures" [moves the magnifying glass over the doll's body and fixes it there, focusing the sun's rays into a point]
Kyle
[fakes a cry] "Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!"
Stan
"Scream for me, bitch!"
Kyle
"AAAAAAAH!" [the doll's head begins to melt and shrivel, then Stan removes the magnifying glass]
Stan, Kyle
Whoa! Awesome!
Cartman
[runs up excitedly] Ey you guys! You guys! Come 'ere, you guys, come check this out!
Stan
Oh no, what now?
Cartman
No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! [goes away, and Stan and Kyle follow]
Kenny's house, later. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle approach the house. Kenny's on the front lawn with a dog, and the other boys join him
Kyle
What's this all about, Kenny?
Kenny
(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
Cartman
Watch this. It's sooo funny. [grins] Come 'ere, dog, come on. [giggles as he starts pleasing the dog] Good dog. [the dog rolls over on its back and Cartman starts stroking the dog's penis] Red rocket red rocket. [Stan and Kyle look at each other. Kenny starts to laugh and clap, and the dog's penis lengthens] Red rocket. Red rocket. [chuckles] Come on. [giggles]
Stan
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Cartman
I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
Kyle
No they don't!
Kenny
(Yeah they do!)
Cartman
[continues milking] Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it. [concentrates on the dog] Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket! [the dogs ejaculates, and the semen lands on Cartman's face] Ohooohhh!
Stan
Whoa, cool! [the dog quickly stands up and walks off]
Kyle
That's awesome!
Cartman
I told you guys.
Stan
I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
Cartman
[sighs] Dumbass, you can only milk a dog once every few hours. It doesn't work if you beat off the dog again right away.
Kyle
You "beat off?"
Cartman
[rolls his eyes up] That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off. [looks at Kenny] Don't you guys know anything?
Stan
Wow, you learned all this from the fifth graders?
Cartman
Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! [laughs as a gray dog approaches]
Stan's house, night. Sharon is holding court in the living room, in a circle of chairs. She and Randy have eight guests over for some discussion...
Sharon
I was really happy with this month's book. I agree with what Bob and Linda said-
Stan
[rushes in with Sparky] Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
Sharon
Not now, Stanley. This is Mommy and Daddy's book club night, remember?
Stan
But it's super-cool!
Sharon
Later, sweetie. [to the group] Anyway, I found myself enticed by Steinbeck's imagery.
Man
Uh the first chapter alone was filled with poetry.
Sharon
[Stan takes the dog and sets up near the table, away from the club circle] Oh, wasn't it? I mean, the first sentence: [reads from "Cannery Row." Stan starts milking the dog]
Stan
Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.
Sharon
"Cannery Row in Monterey in California-" ["Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket."] "-is a poem, a stink, a grating noise..." [The other adults lean in to see the action in the background. "Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky."] It's amazing how with three images [Mrs. Tweek covers her mouth as Mr. Tweek looks on, surprised] he puts you right there, and...
Stan
[his parents turn at the sound of his voice] Red rocket, red rocket!
Randy
[recognizes the activity] WAAAH!
Sharon
Stanley, what the hell are you doing?!
Stan
I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. [the other adults turn away or show shocked looks]
Sharon
[both parents now standing] STANLEY, YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW!
Stan
My room? Why?
Sharon
Go, Stanley! [he walks off to his room. Sparky looks at the group, then gets up and follows Stan out, with penis still erect. Sharon turns around and says sheepishly] Ahaha, ahem. Heheh, he, he gets very good grades.
Stan's house, later. His parents have entered his room, quite upset at his behavior earlier. Stan rests his head on his hands.
Sharon
Stanley, do you know why you're being grounded for ten months?
Stan
No!
Randy
Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company! [Sharon glances at him] Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!
Stan
Why?! What's the big deal?!
Sharon
Stanley, don't you understand what you are doing??
Stan
I was doing "red rocket" to make the dog's milk come out.
Randy
No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.
Stan
Huh??
Sharon
You were stimulating the dog, Stanley! What came out of him was his... r-Randy?!
Randy
Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out. [Stan looks confused] Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!
Stan
What things??
Sharon
Sexual education. Haven't you learned that yet?
Stan
No!
Sharon
Oh. Look, well, you see, Stanley,... Well, your school should be teaching this stuff!
Randy
Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! [walks out the door. Sharon follows him out. Stan looks ahead blankly]
South Park PTA meeting, night. The parents are there, clamoring and arguing.
Principal Victoria
Okay, parents. I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.
Sharon
[stands] Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There's no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.
Principal Victoria
School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.
Mr. Tweek
It isn't soon enough.
Stuart
Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin' off our dog. [Randy and Sharon look at each other in recognition of the act]
Chef
Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.
Ms. Choksondik
Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.
Chef
The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn't be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.
Sheila
[rising] No, she's right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy does need to know about sexual education. [sits, then rises again] From the school.
Adults
Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to.
South Park Elementary, day. "Fourth Grade B" is shown on a classroom door. Sixteen boys are present.
Mr. Mackey
Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny. Words like "penis" and "vagina." [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman stifle some giggles] Nuh- now STOP that, m'kay! We're goin' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m'kay. [turns and goes over to turn off the light, and turn on the projector with a remote control. Color cross-sections of male and female anatomies show up on the screen. Mackey jabs the screen with his pointer. The boys, especially Kyle, analyze the pictures. Mackey then points to the male anatomy] Now, this is the male anatomy, m'kay. Here we see the testes and the scrotum. [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman stifle some more giggles] STOP that, m'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral! [the boys stop quick] M'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh... [slows his speech a bit] let's see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm.
Stan
Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
Mr. Mackey
Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh... [turns around and starts again] I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??
South Park Elementary, day. "Fourth Grade" is shown on a classroom door — this is Ms. Choksondik's room. Twelve girls are present.
Ms. Choksondik
Alright girls, even though this may be stuff you don't want to hear, you need to hear it.
Wendy
Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.
Bebe
Yeah, we think it's gonna be fun!
Girls
Yeah!
Ms. Choksondik
Fun! It's going to be fun! Well let's start with our first lesson, then, shall we? [writes on the board] SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!! [the girls sit quietly] That's right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?
Wendy
I didn't mean that-
Ms. Choksondik
Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, "It's not going to happen to me." You say, "Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado." WRONG! [the girls look chastened] Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences! [the girls are definitely afraid] You think that sex is about fun and games and love? [now with a folder in her left hand] Wrong! Sex is about disease! Here's a little picture of herpes.
Girls
AAAHHH!
Ms. Choksondik
And here's a little syphilis for you!
Girls
AAAHHH!
Ms. Choksondik
That's right, girls. Here's what happens when you don't get boys to use condoms!
The school kitchen, lunch.
Chef
Hello there, children.
Boys
Hey Chef.
Chef
How is sexual education class going?
Stan
It's dumb. Mr. Mackey doesn't teach us nothin'.
Chef
Yeah, I don't think Ol' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik? I'd be surprised if she's ever gotten laid in her life.
Kyle
Yeah... Chef, what's "laid"?
Chef
...Oh, nothin'. Now, move along, children, you're holdin' up the line.
The school cafeteria, moments later. The boys exit the kitchen. Behind them are Tweek, Token, Clyde, Butters, Kevin and Timmy.
Kyle
Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
Stan
Yeah. [they approach the girls] Hey Wendy, did you guys get-
Girls
AAAAHHH! [hurry away from their table]
Kyle
What the hell is wrong with them? [the boys move towards the girls, who now have their backs against the far wall]
Stan
You guys, we just wanna know-
Girls
AAAAHHH!
Wendy
Stay away from me, Stan!
Stan
Why?
Wendy
Are you wearing a condom?
Stan
...A what?
Girls
AAAAHHH!
Bebe
Do any of you have your condoms on?
Kyle
No.
Girls
AAAAHHH!
Wendy
Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
Kyle
Nuh uh.
Bebe
Yuh huh! If you don't wear a condom, you're gonna get AIDS.
Cartman
AIDS?
Butters
Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
Kyle
Is that what you learned in sex ed?
Cartman
Mr. Mackey didn't say nothin' about that.
Stan
Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
Wendy
You guys have to wear condoms. Now, please, just, just go away. We don't want your AIDS.
Stan
[moves towards Wendy] But Wendy, we don't understand how that-
Girls
AAAAHHH! [they throw their food up in the air and scatter, leaving the boys confused]
Kyle
Oh my God, dude.
Butters
Uh what are we gonna do, huh?
Stan
Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.
Boys
Yeah. [they set their meals down at nearby tables and walk away. Cartman returns for his meal and takes it with him]
South Park pharmacy. The boys go in: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Clyde, Token, Butters, Kevin, Tweek, and Timmy
Pharmacist
Can I help you boys?
Stan
Yeah, we need condoms!
Pharmacist
[looks at them funny] Condoms?
Kyle
Yeah. Quick!
Pharmacist
How old are you boys?
Stan
Why does that matter?
Butters
Ha-I'll be nine next week.
Pharmacist
Sorry, kids, I'm not selling you condoms.
Kyle
Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
Pharmacist
I just don't think kids your age should be-
Assistant
[intervening] Mark, we have to be willing to supply condoms to anyone who requests them.
Mark
But... they're... children!
Assistant
Would you rather them do it unprotected?
Cartman
Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
Mark
I just think that all this sex ed and condom talk in elementary school is wrong!
Assistant
Kids are going to do what they do, and it's up to us to make sure they're protected.
Stan
Well, I'm glad this lady's on our side.
Mark
I don't think we have any that'll even fit them!
Assistant
Sure we do. We just got in the new Gladiators for kids. 'Lil Mini's. They're specially designed for kids under 10, and they're only five ninety five for a box of fifty.
Butters
Fifty?? Uh, can't we just use the same one every day?
Assistant
No, you have to change it.
Kyle
Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
Ms. Choksondik's house, night. Mr. Mackey has come by for a visit. Books sit on two tables and the floor
Mr. Mackey
Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.
Ms. Choksondik
Oh, it's no problem, Mr. Mackey. It's probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.
Mr. Mackey
Yeah I've already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... "missed" anything.
Ms. Choksondik
[reaches for a book and opens it] Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences. We have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex.
Mr. Mackey
Right! Oral sex, which of course would be...
Ms. Choksondik
[reading, then she looks at him] Using your mouth on the penis or vagina.
Mr. Mackey
Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay.
Ms. Choksondik
It's just too bad these girls are having sex so young.
Mr. Mackey
Yeah, why d-uh, did you?
Ms. Choksondik
Did I what?
Mr. Mackey
Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.
Ms. Choksondik
Well, if you must know, I'm still somewhat of a virgin. [thinks, then quickly adds] But I'm not ashamed of it! I wasn't sought after much in high school or college. [rises and moves off some distance] I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses. [looks down at her rims] The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett. I liked him very much, but I... found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the Super Bowl. The loser had to go out with me for three days.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
Ms. Choksondik
People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it's hard to understand.
Mr. Mackey
Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh, [softly] anyhow [normal] And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college. [places the book on the side table]
Ms. Choksondik
Your nickname?
Mr. Mackey
"That guy with the really big head."
Ms. Choksondik
...Right.
Mr. Mackey
Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.
Ms. Choksondik
Wow, I've... never met a man who is... as sexually unappealing as me.
Mr. Mackey
Neither have I.
Ms. Choksondik
[pause] Well, I'm quite happy without sex. I mean, with all the diseases and problems out there, who needs it, right?
Mr. Mackey
Uh not me! [they both giggle.] Huhuh, okay.
Ms. Choksondik
Well, back to the lesson plan, then.
Mr. Mackey
Right. [gets the book again]
Ms. Choksondik
Okay. [they both open their books] "Oral Sex"
Bus stop, day. The boys are gathered there waiting...
Stan
Doesn't it give any other directions?
Butters
Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener. [takes a condom out and gives the bag it Kyle] "If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes"
Kyle
Uh, what are "studzes"
Butters
How the heck should I know? [removes the wrapper from the condom] Why, it's just a little doughnut. [squeezes it a little] Hoh- it's all gooey.
Cartman
Just put it on, Butters.
Butters
Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
Cartman
Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
Butters
Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man. [turns his back to the camera and drops his pants, then slips the condom on] O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.
Kyle
It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
Butters
I don't even understand how this thing... ooh, wait. Oh, I see. [Cartman leans in for a better look]
Stan
Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!
Cartman
I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
Kyle
Sure.
Butters
But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
Tweek
Ah, I got rubber bands. [pulls a few out and walks over to Butters. Butters takes one]
Butters
[rubber band snaps in place] Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh. [snap] Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
Stan
How do you feel?
Butters
...Pretty good.
Cartman
Do you feel protected?
Butters
Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
Stan
Alright, here, everybody. [begins to move from his end to the other, visiting each of the boys] Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
Timmy
Timmehah!
South Park Elementary, day. Principal Victoria has called the teachers together in her office. Chef is there as well.
Principal Victoria
Teachers, I have some bad news. Last night I received a phone call from the local pharmacist. Apparently, almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active. And now that we've scared them a little they're buying condoms to use.
Ms. Choksondik
I knew it! Well, at least we scared them enough to protect themselves. But now maybe you'll believe me when I say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade.
Principal Victoria
But how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use?
Ms. Choksondik
...Kindergarten.
Chef
Kindergarten?!
Ms. Choksondik
We've got to get to the students before they start having... sex. Nu-not after.
Chef
Aw, now this is getting ridiculous!
Mr. Adler
I have to agree with Ms. Choksondik. It's our responsibility to make sure our kids are safe if they're gonna screw around.
Principal Victoria
I guess we have no choice.
Kindergarten, next day.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is? [puts a box of Gladiator condoms on the table. The kindergartners look at him, and finally a girl raises her hand] Yes, Jenny?
Jenny
It flies around and it's endangered.
Mr. Garrison
That's a con-dor, Jenny. Con-dor. [holds up the box] Con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of STDs. [Filmore raises his hand] Yes, Filmore?
Filmore
Can we do fingerpaint?
Mr. Garrison
NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom. [puts a phallus on the table] First of all you remove the condom from its package. [demonstrates] Then you find which way the condom rolls out. [demonstrates] Put it in your mouth... [puts it in his mouth] And apply. [proceeds to do so. The kids watch on astonished, and one of the boys finally cries. Mr. Garrison finishes and raises his head] And it's as simple as that. Any questions?
Ms. Choksondik's classroom, same time.
Ms. Choksondik
Alright girls. Yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys, but today we're going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all. [writes on the board] PREGNANCY! [turns around] That's right, since you girls have decided to be sexually active, teen pregnancy is at an all-time high! You seem to think it's gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well, let's watch a little video, shall we?! [goes towards the door and wheels back a TV cart with VCR, and turns on the TV.]
Narrator
["The Miracle of Child Birth"] Snacky S'mores presents: The Miracle of Child Birth. [shot of the girls watching] The time is drawing close for delivery. Here we can see the water breaking.
Girls
Eeeeww. [as the narrator speaks, the girls get more and more shocked]
Narrator
Later, the contractions are happening closer together. Mom sure is in a lot of pain. Now we can see the crown of the baby's head, stretching the vaginal walls in ways never before thought possible by Mom. Finally, the miracle happens, and the baby is born. [Screen shot of baby being handled by the doctor is shown] but Mom's not done yet.
Girl
Eeww.
Narrator
She still got some afterbirth to push out of her. [shot of afterbirth being pushed out]
Girls
AAAAAAAA!!!! [they get out of their seats and rush out of the room]
Narrator
That's right.
Ms. Choksondik
[follows the girl to the door] Girls! Girls! Where are you going?! [gets no answer, but she sees Mr. Mackey in front of her, in the hallway ending at her door, about to enter another door. She looks down and notices his butt, and just stands there...]
Mr. Mackey's class, later. Some of the boys, including Stan and Kyle, have their hands over their crotches.
Stan
Man, this condom's driving me crazy.
Kyle
Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
Cartman
Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. [takes a condom just filled with urine and tosses it at the trashcan. It hits the side and splatters the urine next to the can.]
Mr. Mackey
[enters with briefcase and books] Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay. [tosses the briefcase and books onto his desk and moves towards the light switch, grinning. He turns off the lights and starts the projector] M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening. [a picture of the female reproductive system. He points to the opening. Cartman works on a new condom] This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?
Cartman
I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
Mr. Mackey
Why are you wearing a condom?
Cartman
So I don't get AIDS.
Mr. Mackey
Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.
Stan
From sex??
Mr. Mackey
Yes.
Kyle
You mean, intercourse with a girl?
Mr. Mackey
Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.
Stan
All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
Cartman
I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
Mr. Mackey
Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
Kyle
Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
Stan
Yeah, come on guys, this is war! [leaves his seat and heads for the door. The other boys follow]
Boys
[among their statements] Yeah! That's right! Come on! [The last of the boys leaves, and Mr. Mackey doesn't notice. He begins to daydream. The generic female drawing turns into one of Ms. Choksondik, and he grins. He goes to the screen again, and moves his hand over the image]
Mr. Mackey
And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m'kay.
Mr. Garrison's room, later
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?
Filmore
[raises his hand] Miss'nary position?
Mr. Garrison
[turns around and writes the position] Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?
Girl
Doggie?
Mr. Garrison
[turns around and writes the position] That's right. Doggie style we went over, mhm.
Boy
Pile driver?
Mr. Garrison
[turns around and writes the position] Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid.
Flora
The Filthy Sanchez?
Mr. Garrison
[turns around and writes the position] Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez.
Boy 2
Hot Karl?
Mr. Garrison
[turns around and writes the position] Yes,you can give your partner the ol' Hot Karl, sure.
A barren field near the school, day. An army of boys comes in from a distance in makeshift military vehicles. Butters is wearing a hockey mask. Clyde comes up and stops them.
Clyde
There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. [the stronghold has a moat and reads: "Boys Keep Out"]
Wendy
[at the helm of a gun turret] Stay away from us, bastards! We don't wanna get pregnant!
Bebe
Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!
Stan
Ha! They're your diseases!
Kyle
Yeah! You get out of town!
Cartman
Here, talk to them, Butters.
Butters
[lifts up his mask] Uh, me?? Huh, what the heck am I supposed to say?
Cartman
Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
Butters
[lowers his mask and speaks into the mike. A deep raspy voice comes out] Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.
Kyle
[to Stan] Man, he's pretty good.
Bebe
We'll never walk away. Never! [tosses a boomerang towards the boys. Clyde ducks as the boomerang comes towards him, and Kenny is struck dead]
Kenny
(Waa-ooo!) [falls back and expires]
Cartman
Oh, bitch!
Stan
That does it! Attack! [the boys rush the stronghold]
Ms. Choksondik's house, at that moment. They have books open
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay.
Ms. Choksondik
I've already gone through that with the girls. [closes her book and sets it down] It's pretty simple. Do you wanna drink?
Mr. Mackey
Why, sure. [she goes to get drinks] Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm... [he gets a good look at her derriere] Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.
Ms. Choksondik
[hands Mr. Mackey his drink] Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse. [sits down]
Mr. Mackey
Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.
Ms. Choksondik
Or the... shaft... of the penis? [they look away from each other]
Mr. Mackey
It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay.
Ms. Choksondik
Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the... [looks at him. They draw close to each other] clitoris of the woman.
Mr. Mackey
And these... are the two areas most important to-
Ms. Choksondik
Sexual stimulation. [they kiss quick, then kiss full and long. Some love music comes up. She pulls back] Oh, is this wrong?
Mr. Mackey
I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong. [they kiss full again] I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik.
Ms. Choksondik
Yeah? What do you do when you think about me?
Mr. Mackey
I go crazy.
Ms. Choksondik
Do you touch yourself?
Mr. Mackey
Yeah. Hmm. [they embrace. She takes off his tie. He stands, walks some distance, and takes off his shirt. She stands, takes off her top, and tosses it away. She approaches him and removes his belt. He takes off his pants. She looks at him again and goes down to remove his briefs. She tosses them aside. He bends down to remove her underwear and tosses them aside. She coaxes him down, and he follows]
Ms. Choksondik
[writhing] Haawww. Haawww.
Mr. Mackey
G'oh, m'kay.
Ms. Choksondik
Oh my God. Oh God, yeah! Stop! Stop!
Mr. Mackey
Huh, what's wrong?
Ms. Choksondik
It's your turn. [goes down to work on him]
Mr. Mackey
Mm, oh, oh Ms. Choksondik. Okay! Okay!
Ms. Choksondik
[gets up] Do you want me?
Mr. Mackey
I do.
Ms. Choksondik
Tell me.
Mr. Mackey
I want you. M'kay. [they go down, then moments later quickly get up]
Ms. Choksondik
Wait wait wait! Do you have a condom?
Mr. Mackey
Well. No.
Ms. Choksondik
[looks into his eyes and then] Oh well, fuck it [they go down, and the consummation begins] Oh God, give it to me! [his ass rises for the first time]
Mr. Mackey
Oh yeah. Woh. [his ass appears again]
Ms. Choksondik
Woh. [his ass appears again] Ooh, that's it baby! That's it!
Mr. Mackey
[his ass appears again] Aw, this feels so good, m'kay. [his ass appears again]
The empty field. later. The battle is joined. Kids run around seeking positions from which to shoot. Seven boys come up to the stronghold gate. A girl fires a Gatling gun at them from the left side, and they scatter, dropping their weapons
Boys
WAAAAHHH!! [two boys prepare a Molotov cocktail, and one of them tosses it at the tires on the right side of the gate entrance. The tires go up in flames. The boys run away, and a huge flash explosion rises inside the stronghold]
Girls
Waaaahh!! [they bail out immediately, and a much larger explosion rises, tossing kids away left and right]
The Marsh house. Randy and Sharon are reading papers when the house moves about as if an earthquake had just rolled by. Sharon drops her paper
Sharon
What the hell was that?
Ms. Choksondik's house. Mr. Mackey and Ms. Choksondik rise from their activity and look out the window
Ms. Choksondik
Did you feel something?
Chef's house. The front door opens and he walks out. He's shocked at what he sees.
Chef
Oh, no!
South Park Elementary. The four remaining staff members, Principal Victoria, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Adler, and Ms. Chosie, walk out and see the wreckage. Principal Victoria puts her hand over her mouth in dumbfounded shock
Mr. Garrison
Jesus Christ. [a shot of the burning wreckage, then of Butters, Cartman, Stan, and Kyle looking at the wreckage]
Cartman
Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
The empty field. later. All the parents have come by to make sure their kids are okay. The wreckage still burns
Sharon
Well, I don't know what got into you kids. You should be ashamed of yourselves. [in the background paramedics pick up injured kids and put them in ambulances]
Stan
We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
Ms. Choksondik
I'm afraid this is all my fault. I... think I went a little overboard scaring the girls. I forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you... have to have sex with them first.
Kids
Oooohhh.
Chef
Well, I hate to say it, but you all got what you deserved.
Parents
Huh?
Chef
Look: Schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day! But sex isn't something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don't know who they're learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn't know, [a shot of Mr. Mackey] someone who has a bad opinion of it, [a shot of Ms. Choksondik looking around] or even a complete pervert. [a shot of Mr. Garrison]
Mr. Garrison
Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?
Ms. Choksondik
He's right. I never knew how special and personal sex was un... until just recently.
Sharon
This whole mess started because we couldn't talk to our boy ourselves.
Sheila
It's easier to just leave it up to the school, but it's...just not a school subject.
Principal Victoria
Then it's decided: no more condom classes in grade school.
Kids
Hooray!
Stan
But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
Chef
It's very simple, children. The right time to start having sex is... 17.
Kyle
Seventeen? [Sheila and Gerald approach]
Chef
Seventeen.
Sheila
So you mean 17 as long as you're in love?
Chef
Nope, just 17.
Gerald
But, what if you're not ready at 17?
Chef
Seventeen! You're ready. [Stan walks up to Wendy]
Stan
Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
Wendy
Yeah. Thank God.
Cartman
Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy! [a dog enters the scene, and the camera begins to zoom out. Everyone is smiling and looking on as Cartman pleases the dog] That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
End of Proper Condom Use, but Mr. Garrison has a few more things to say
Mr. Garrison
Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm.
End of Proper Condom Use

Towelie
Stan's house, day. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are in the living room playing video games.
Kyle
HA! I killed you!
Stan
HA, I blew your head off!
Kenny
(Aw, Goddamnit!)
Stan
Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?
Kyle
Hey Cartman! We're almost to level 20! You giving birth in there, or what?
Cartman
Let a man take a crap!
Stan
Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.
Kyle
Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
Stan
Come on, Cartman! You're missing the game!
Cartman
[from behind the bathroom door] I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that? [finishes wiping his butt and zips himself up. He comes out of the bathroom with something in his hands] You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
Kyle
Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
Cartman
Because I thought it was a jelly doughnut, but look, check it out, it's all bloody.
Sharon
[walks in with a basket of laundry] Are you guys still playing that video game?
Stan
Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
Cartman
[holds it up] Look. [Sharon gasps and drops the laundry. Cartman unravels it] But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. [looks through it]
Sharon
Eric, put that down!
Cartman
Why?
Sharon
Just go put it back in the trashcan!
Cartman
[inspects it] Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
Sharon
No that... that came from me; just put it away.
Cartman
This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?! [hick accent] You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
Stan
[looks up at his mom] What is it, Mom?
Kyle
Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
Sharon
Boys, that a... feminine thing. Alright, it's a personal, woman thing. [game play stops and the boys look at her] I tell you what: If you'll just drop the whole thing right now, I'll buy you that new video game console you've been wanting.
Stan
The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
Sharon
Sure.
Kyle
Cool!
Cartman
Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
Luau's Toys, day, later. A banner reading "WE HAVE GAMESPHERE" hangs over the window, and the console itself is in the window display.
Stan
There it is. The Okama GameSphere. [the game console is shown, along with two controllers and several boxes containing the console]
Kyle
Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
Stan
What's that?
Kyle
Don't know, but it kicks ass. [they watch as Sharon buys the console from Mr. Harris and he wraps it up and delivers it to her] Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
Cartman
Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. [the boys turn away from the window]
Stan
Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend. [checks his watch.] It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Kyle
Awesome! [suddenly remembers] Oh, crap.
Stan
What?
Kyle
I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
Stan
Dude, we got GameSphere.
Kyle
I know, I know. Well, look: I'll stay over anyway so I can play for... eighteen hours, and then I'll go to the lake. [a strange character walks up next to them]
Towelie
Don't forget to bring a towel. [it's a walking, talking towel]
Stan
What?
Towelie
When you get out of the water you need to dry off right away to avoid catchin' a cold. That's why Towelie says, "Don't forget to bring a towel."
Stan
...O-kay.
Kyle
Thanks, Towelie.
Towelie
[after a few moments of silence] Do you wanna get high?
Stan
No. [Towelie looks for a few moments, then walks away]
Kyle
Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
Cartman
Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
Sharon
Here you go, boys. [Stan takes the shopping box and the boys take off]
Boys
AAAAAA.
Stan's house, later. In the living room, Kyle finishes connecting the GameSphere to the back of the TV
Kyle
Okay, turn it on.
TV
"Okama GameSphere"!
Boys
Whoa!
TV
[the game title comes up] Thirst For BLOOD!
Cartman
Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
Kyle
Oh, this is so cool.
Cartman
Bring it, bring it! [on the TV two monsters fight each other. The one on the right attacks the other with a chainsaw. "Oh!"]
Stan's house, night. The boys have been playing for hours. Around them are empty boxes of Cheesy Poofs and cans of Zoop soda. On the sofa is a bag of chips. Stan's parents walk up to the boys.
Sharon
Goodnight, boys. Don't stay up too late.
Stan
G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.
Cartman
[slowly slides into a hick accent] Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
Randy
What?
Sharon
Nothing. Come on, Randy. [whisks him off to bed. From the TV: "Twenty kills."]
Stan's house, Sunday morning, dawn. The boys have stayed up all night playing video games. Kyle is on the phone with his parents.
Kyle
Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got- [to Cartman] wha-what is it?
Cartman
Date-rape psychosis.
Kyle
Date-rape something. Yeah. Okay. I will. Okay, thanks, Mon. [hangs up] I don't have to go outside!
Cartman
Awesome!
Kyle
She said it's fine, but that I still have to go to baseball practice tonight..
Stan
Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
Cartman
We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
Stan
Well, it's alright. We can still play for [looks at his watch] six more hours, and then we'll go play baseball.
Towelie
[walks in from nowhere] Don't forget to bring a towel.
Kyle
Uh no.
Towelie
When you're playin' sports, the sweat can get in your face. That's why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."
Stan
Okay, we will.
Towelie
[raises its arms in victory] Alright! [lowers them, then after some moments] Do you wanna get high?
Kyle
No we don't wanna get high!
Towelie
Okay... You sure?
Cartman
Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! [Towelie goes away]
Stan
Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!
Cartman
That's... so... cool!
Stan's house, later... The boys have repositioned themselves and look half-asleep from all the game play. Doughnuts and ice cream appear - a cone is on the rug with its ice cream melting. Sharon walks up to them again.
Sharon
Okay, boys, that's it. You have to go now.
Stan
No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
Sharon
No, Stanley, it's Monday morning. You have to go to school.
Cartman
It's Monday?
Stan
Oh, uh, I'm sick.
Kyle
Me too.
Sharon
No, you're not sick. Now get to school. [disconnects the console from the TV] All of you.
Stan
But Mom...
Sharon
Go!
Boys
Aagh!
Bus stop, moments later. The boys are now waiting for the bus.
Stan
Can't believe we have to go to school!
Kyle
Yeah, real life is so boring and stupid.
Stan
We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. [a green car pulls up in front of them. Two soldiers are in it]
Commander
Hello, boys, how are you?
Stan
Fine.
Commander
Say, boys, this may sound a little ...odd, but... have you see a ...talking ...towel around anywhere.
Kyle
What? You mean Towelie? [the two soldier look alarmed. The passenger quickly gets on the radio]
Commander
Echo, this is Garrett. I've got a code 5 at... [checks his map] Park County, Colorado! Repeat! Code 5, Park County, Colorado! [the men look at the boys]
Cartman
What, dude? [the driver steps on the gas and the car peels away. The passenger soldier looks out the window and back at the boys.]
Stan
This is gonna be one looong-ass day. [Ms. Crabtree pulls up and the boys get on the bus.]
Stan's house, Monday afternoon. The boys arrive there from the bus stop
Stan
That was the longest day of school ever!
Kyle
Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! [the boys burst in and head for the television]
Stan's house, living room. The boys stand in from of the television
Kyle
Where is it?
Stan
It... it was right here.
Kyle
Where the hell is it??
Cartman
Come on, man, this isn't funny! [Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman look around and behind the TV] I need my fix! [the phone rings, and Stan goes to answer it.]
Stan
Hello?
Voice
If you ever wanna see your Okama GameSphere again, you will bring us the towel. [the boys gather to wait for Stan]
Stan
What? Who-who is this?
Voice
Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else! [in the background: "Okama GameSphere!"]
Stan
Don't hurt it! [Click. Stan then hangs up]
Kyle
What? [Stan turns around]
Stan
They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
Cartman
[in disbelief, backs up.] No! ...No!
Kyle
Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they've taken it"? Oh, this isn't happening! This isn't happening!!
South Park, sunset. The boys walk down Main Street.
Stan
Towelie!
Cartman
Hey, towel!
Kyle
Where the hell is he?
Kenny
(I don't know. Where could it be?)
Stan
I don't know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.
Kyle
What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
Cartman
Hey maybe we'd better do a towel call. [the others stop, and he calls out in one direction] Gebaayybeh! [then in another] Gebaayybeh!
Kyle
That's a towel call?
Stan
This is hopeless. We're never gonna find him.
Kyle
Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
Stan
Hey yeah. [goes into the street and clears his throat] Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool! [looks around. So do the others] Aaah. Let's go take a shower! [all look around] Let's go waterskiing!
Towelie
[walks up] Don't forget to bring a towel.
Kyle
There he is!
Towelie
Be sure to bring a towel so you don't get aaall wet. [Stan walks over angrily and takes Towelie's left hand, and pulls him along].
Stan
Come on, dude! [the others follow]
Towelie
Where are we goin'?
Kyle
Just come on! It's getting dark.
Towelie
Are we gonna get high?
Outskirts of South Park, night. A full moon shines down on the boys as they reach the gas station
Kyle
Are you sure this is where they said to be?
Stan
They said the gas station outside of town.
Towelie
Well, I'm gonna get a little high. [A high-powered light comes on]
Man
Hold it! [ten men stand in the light. Some of them wear red berets]
Stan
Who is that? [squints his eyes and blocks the light. Towelie does the same]
Man
Step... away... from the towel! [the boys do so, and an official steps forth]
Official
There you are, towel. We've been looking all over for you.
Towelie
If you ever go to a hotel, be sure to bring your own towel.
Official
It isn't safe for you out here, towel. There are people out here to mean to harm you.
Stan
'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
Official
Your what?
Kyle
Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
Official
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stan
You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
Official
Omigod! [shrieks] IT"S A TRAP!! [gunfire strikes him and kills him. Behind the boys soldiers pop up in the hills and continue firing]
Man 2
Cover! Cover! [the officials and their personal security force fire back, and the light is knocked out]
Stan
Goddamnit, what now?!
Official
Run, towel! [a grenade lands between two guards and blows up, shredding them to bits. The boys just look on]
Stan
[disinterested] Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. [leads the others away]
Soldier 1
Where's the towel?!
Soldier 2
It can't be far! [two more soldiers come up, and others move along behind them] Alvarez, you and Mitchell sweep left!
Guard
[coughs up blood. The boys arrive] Hurry! You must get the towel back to Tynacorp!
Stan
[grabs the guard by the lapels and throttles him] Where is our Okama GameSphere?
Guard
Get the towel home [cough] They will explain everything. Please, hurry! [coughs up blood once more, and dies]
Kyle
Aw, God-damnit!
Stan
Do you know where he's talking about, Towelie?
Towelie
What? Oh yeah, back at the base. It's a long ways away.
Stan
Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. [they go for the truck. From a distance in a woods nearby, a commander looks at the troop movements]
Commander
Well?
Soldier
They've gone, sir. It's like they've vanished out of thin air.
Commander
Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel. [gets pensive] They must have some unexplainable bond with it.
Soldier 2
Perhaps they're telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T. [the commander looks at him annoyed, and he leaves]
Commander
It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate... Plan B.
Soldier 3
You mean...?
Commander
Yes. [camera zooms in] Destroy all towels within a thousand mile radius. [fade to black]
A desert, later that night. The truck rolls along... Stan steers, Kyle, Towelie, and Cartman ride along. Kenny mans the pedals
Kyle
Are we getting close?
Towelie
I think so.
Stan
A little more gas, Kenny. [Kenny presses down on the gas pedal]
Kyle
How long has it been since you've been back there.
Towelie
I've been wanderin' around on my own for the past few weeks. You know, helpin' people out with towel safety and proper towel use. It's important.
Cartman
No it isn't.
Towelie
Is!
Cartman
No it isn't.
Towelie
Is! Wait, turn down here. It's down this dirt road.
Stan
Brake, Kenny, brake. [Kenny brakes, and Stan steers the truck to the right to go down the dirt road. Towelie moves to the window]
Cartman
Egh!
Towelie
M-maybe it's down that dirt road.
Stan
[sighs] Dude, don't you remember where it is?
Towelie
I can't remember, it all looks the same. Hold on, let me get high. [pulls out a joint...] then I'll remember where it is. [lights the joint and puffs deeply. The boys watch him as his eyes get bloodshot.]
Stan
Alright, so where is it?
Towelie
Where's what?
Boys
Agh!
Kyle
The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! [Towelie simply snorts]
Stan
Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny! [Kenny brakes angrily and the truck jerks to a stop] Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
Towelie
Well calm down.
Kyle
That's it! [takes the joint] You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
Towelie
That's my last joint, asshole!
Kyle
I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
Towelie
Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.
A purple house, night. Inside, in the restroom, a woman washes her hands and face, then pulls a towel out of its rack to dry herself
Woman
Kevin? Don't forget to wrap the potato salad in aluminum foil. [some strange sounds are heard outside the door] Kevin, is that you?
Soldier
Harris! Reach bang and clear!
Woman
Hello? [the bathroom door flies open and five soldiers pour in, firing away] WAAH! [she falls to the ground quick] Ohmigod! Oh no! Ohmigod! [she covers her head]
Soldier
Alright, it's clear! It's clear! [the soldiers leave the restroom. The woman gets up and checks herself for bullet wounds and finds none. She turns to see the wall behind her. The towels on their rack are shot through with holes. She blinks, confused]
a backyard. Mrs. Tweak pulls down some clothes she's had drying on clotheslines. As she nears the towels, three soldiers rush in and start firing away at them
Soldiers
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! [Mrs. Tweak leans out of the way, watching her towels get shot up.]
Soldier
Let's go let's go! [The soldiers finish their job and walk away. Mrs. Tweak straightens up]
A men's gym shower, night. Mr. Garrison is in the shower with two other men. He finishes and wraps a white towel with blue stripes around his waist, then walks towards his locker
Soldier
Get it!
Mr. Garrison
What the? [two soldiers rush over and make him face the lockers. One of them pulls off his towel]
Soldier
Throw it down! [the soldier throws it down]
Mr. Garrison
Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! [the soldier stabs at the towel twice, then directs another soldier to fire away at it. The other soldier shoots at it while the other two watch]
Soldier
Alright, let's go! [the soldiers leave]
Mr. Garrison
Huh where are you goin'?
The truck the boys are driving pulls up in front of a gleaming glass building with "TYNACORP" above the entrance, and the boys pour out with Towelie
Cartman
This is where you came from?
Towelie
Yeah, I think so. [gets woozy] Oh man.
Stan
What?
Towelie
I'm so high right now. I have no idea what's goin' on. [the group goes around the fountain and goes inside]
Tynacorp, inside. The boys walk down a long passageway
Research Leader
Welcome home, Smart Towel RG-400.
Stan
Ah hi, is this where our Okama GameSphere is?
Kyle
We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
Research Leader
Thank you for bringing him to us, boys. You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth
Stan
We don't care.
Research Leader
You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user's skin was and fluff itself accordingly.
Stan
Dude, we don't care.
Research Leader
Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off.
Stan
We... don't... care.
Kyle
All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
Research Leader
Ah yes, your video game. I'm afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.
Kyle
Who's they?
Research Leader
Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction.
Stan
[dismissive] Don't care, don't care, don't care.
Research Leader
Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA. But then, one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off. Again.
Cartman
Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
Research Leader
I'm afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at "their" base.
Stan
Can you tell us where "that" is, please?
Research Leader
You mean to go right into their base? [thinks] Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie's memory banks. You could sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.
Secret Government Base, night. Inside, various military officials man a command center. Two soldiers walk up to the commander and salute him
Soldier
Sir! Sergeant Masters and Boll are reporting, sir!
Commander
Ah yes. [salutes back, and all three men lower their arms] Tell me, Marine, did you accomplish your primary goal?
Sgt. Masters
Sir yes sir! All towels have been destroyed! The Smart Towel is no doubt eliminated.
Commander
Ahh. And you're... quite sure of this. [the two sergeants look at each other]
Sgt. Boll
Eh yes sir, there isn't a towel left within a hundred miles.
Commander
Hmm... [taps his pointer on the strategic map] So perhaps, then, you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to Tynacorp?!
Sgt. Masters
Oo we...
Sgt. Boll
He must have outsmarted us, sir.
Commander
Well I'm through playing hide and seek! We've got no other choice! Prepare to blow up all of Colorado!
The night sky. Clouds float by overhead, past the full moon. A helicopter flies into the sky and the camera follows it. Two officials prepare the boys for dives into the military base as the research leader talks
Research Leader
In a moment we will be over the base. This is the only way in. Any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts.
Kyle
Okay.
Research Leader
[rolls up to Towelie] I hate to send you back in there, Towelie, but only you have their security system in your memory banks.
Towelie
That's alright. It's always good to bring a towel.
Research Leader
Good luck, boys. The fate of the world is depending on you.
Stan
We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
Guard
Alright, boys. When you drop from the plane, cover and roll. Got it?
Stan
Yeah. [the boys join Towelie and all go to jump from the helicopter]
Guard
Go go go go! [one after the other, the four boys and Towelie jump off, and then the helicopter leaves. Stan is the first to pull his parachute string, and the others follow. Soon they're all next to each other, floating down. Stan sighs]
Kyle
Dude, I figured it out.
Stan
What?
Kyle
If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
Stan
So that'd be, like what, eight hours we could play before school?
Kyle
Seven and a half.
Stan
[getting impatient] Hurry up, stupid parachute!
Secret Government Base, night. The boys land silently and start walking
Cartman
Alright, I think we go over there. [the Secret Government Base entrance is shown with Towelie and the boys approaching the gate]
Towelie
[at the security entry pad] Let's see. [types in some numbers] No. [touches his lips with his right index finger, trying to figure out what to type next]
Stan
Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
Towelie
Hey it's been a long time!
Cartman
You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
Towelie
[faces Cartman] Don't preach to me, fatso!
Cartman
I can preach to you all I want, 'cause you're stupid!
Towelie
You're stupid!
Cartman
Yeah, and you're a towel!
Towelie
You're a towel! [Cartman has nothing more to say, and Towelie hops off the box towards the boys] Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.
Stan
Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! [gives Towelie the joint] Here's your stupid lighter. [tosses Towelie the lighter, and Towelie lights up. The bloodshot eyes return.]
Towelie
Hold on. [hops on the box and types into the entry pad again.] Wait a second [presses a few buttons] That's it!
Kyle
That's it?
Towelie
Yeah. That's the melody to "Funky Town." [starts playing the melody on the keypad] Won't ya take me down... to Funky Town.
Stan
No, Towelie, the entry code!
Towelie
[turns around] For what?
Stan
God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
Secret Government Base, night, inside. The boys climb over the fence and sneak past a soldier without arousing suspicion. They end up at the genetic research building
Kyle
Well let's look in here. [opens the door and leads the others in. Before them are cylinders of liquids, each with a floating deformed clone of Towelie in it. They come across a Towelie clone drying under a heat lamp]
Towelie Clone
Kill... me... Kill... me.
Towelie
Oh my God! No-o-o-o!
Commander
[enters with four soldiers, who quickly get set to fire] Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.
Towelie
[turns around with the boys] What are these things?
Commander
Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn't work too well, I'm afraid.
Towelie Clone
Kill... me.
Stan
Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
Commander
You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.
Stan
Oh God, don't care, don't care.
Commander
[pacing proudly, solemnly] Yes, we've been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret. [the boys show no interest.]
Soldier
Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.
Kyle
What terrifying secret?
Commander
That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!
Cartman
We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
Commander
Don't you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you're dry, the towel makes you more dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. [his voice begins to deepen] Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I'll tell you something: You don't want to know. And I don't know.
Kyle
And we don't care.
Commander
You've been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down.
Stan
So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.
Commander
Oh yes. It has been all along.
Soldier
Can I kill the towel now, sir?
Kyle
Go ahead. [the boys move away quickly]
Commander
No, wait. [stays the weapon] Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. [zoom in on a tiny camera close to Towelie's lower border. Officials back at Tynacorp's command center are looking at the live feed] You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp's central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all.
Stan
But we don't care!
Tynacorp command center. The officials gather around the research leader
Official 1
What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!
Research Leader
The towel has a will of its own. It's... learning compassion.
Official 2
We don't have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!
Research Leader
Then we have no choice. We'll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier. [presses a button. A door with "GS-401" on it slowly spins around. A towel rack appears and a mean-looking buff towel hangs from it]
GS-401
[deep voice] Don't forget to bring a towel!
Tynacorp, outside. Shadows appear in the brush across the way. The commander is there with his troops, the boys, and Towelie
Commander
Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. [hands a disk to Stan] Then upload this encryption disk into their computers.
Stan
We're just going in to get our video game back.
Commander
If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. [hands it to Kyle]
Kyle
Photon rifle, whatever. [the boys enter Tynacorp with Towelie.]
Tynacorp command center. The boys walk through the center slowly
Stan
Hello? Hello, anybody here? [GS-401 hops down from the rafters]
GS-401
Welcome to the party, boys! [flexes and rushes Towelie] HAAARRRHHHH!! [the two towels wrestle a bit]
Towelie
Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.
GS-401
HAAARRRHHHH!! [Kyle fires the photon rifle and knocks the beefier towel away with the beam. The research team and security force pour into the room angrily]
Research Leader
So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?
Commander
[he and his troops pour in another door] Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move! [the two forces face each other, with the boys and Towelie in the middle] Don't make a move, you bastards!
Research Leader
Bring the towel here, boys. They can't shoot children.
Commander
Don't listen to them. They lied to you before.
Research Leader
Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it's time these boys knew what was really gong on!
Stan
Ohmigod, look! [in front of a monitor connected to a long table is the Okama GameSphere the boys had been wanting to get back. The boys rush to it]
Kyle
Our GameSphere! [the boys each get a controller and activate the GameSphere: "Okama GameSphere"]
Stan
Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. [behind him, Towelie exits screen left as the two forces face each other. The boys quickly get lost in the game play]
Research Leader
[turns to look at the boys] You see boys, I'm afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn't they just attack us to begin with? Because they're not the military!
Commander
Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!
Cartman
Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
Kyle
Sweet!
Commander
[now facing the research leader] But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp really is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you've been making towels! Zytar! [pulls at the research leader's head and the face comes off. Under it a green fish-alien head appears]
Stan
Oh, there's gold. Get the gold, Kenny!
Zytar
Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.
Commander
[looks at the boys] And now you know the horrible truth, boys.
Zytar
Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! [fires a gun at the commander. Both sides begin to fire at each other and there are casualties on both sides. Zytar and two guards slowly back away and out of view]
Cartman
Could you turn it up?
Commander
Boys, try to reach the core override! We've got no choice but to try to take them all out! [the boys continue playing their game, so the commander comes up and reaches for the encryption disk in Stan's pocket, then goes away. Towelie sits on the floor with a huge bong, getting high. The commander reappears across the room moving towards a red button] I think I can get it from here, boys!
Zytar
[returns] What are you doing? You'll kill us all!
Commander
Sorry, Zytar. Didn't your mom ever tell you? Don't mess with earthlings. [inserts the disk and a huge explosion blows the boys out of the room.]
Boys
Oooww! [Then it blows out the roof and some sides of the main building, and the boys find themselves hanging from Towelie, above a boiling tank of acid]
Cartman
Hup hup. Come on, hang on. [Stan and Kyle moan]
Stan, Kyle
Whoa.
Kenny
(Help help! Heeelllppp!) [loses his grip on Kyle]
Cartman
Kenny!
Kenny
(Nooo!) [falls into the acid tank, disintegrating and sinking. Kyle looks on, but next to him is the GameSphere]
Kyle
[sees it] Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! [above him, Stan watches large pieces of metal fall to the ground]
Stan
Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! [Kyle swings ever closer to the GameSphere]
GS-401
[walks in on an adjacent catwalk and sees Towelie with the boys hanging] What are you doing?
Towelie
Get away from me, you evil towel!
GS-401
Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them.
Towelie
No way! They're my friends!
GS-401
They aren't your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels' turn now.
Kyle
[swings closer] I've almost got it!
GS-401
You're going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness. [holds out a joint. Towelie looks at it longingly] Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you've had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!
Stan
[feels Towelie slip] Aw, crap!
GS-401
You're going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high.
Towelie
You asshole.
Cartman
Towelie, don't let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle's almost there!
GS-401
Come, Towelie! Make your decision!
Towelie
I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! [Stan is shocked at the answer. Towelie stretches enough to take a puff while holding on to the boys, then slips enough for Kyle to succeed]
Kyle
I got it! [grabs the GameSphere. Towelie pulls himself and the boys up to the catwalk in front of a door. An explosion behind GS-401 sends it into the air]
GS-401
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [floats down into the acid and disintegrates]
Stan
Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
Kyle, Towelie
Alright!
Cartman
Hooray!
Stan's house, night. The boys are gathered before the TV playing their Okama GameSphere with a new player: Towelie.
Stan
Oh, dude, we finished level 50!
Kyle
Awesome!
Towelie
Oh, man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
Kyle
Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
Stan
Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
Towelie
[heavily slurred] Don't forget to bring a towel. [the boys laugh]
Cartman
You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
Towelie
I know.
End of Towelie

Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants
Bus stop, day. The four boys stand at the bus stop waiting for the bus. Each of them wears a gas mask. The boys are silent.
Kyle
...Remember when life used to be simple and cool?
Cartman
...Not really.
Butters
[runs up] Uh, hey! [The boys jump, startled] How's it goin', fellas?
Stan
Butters, what the hell are you doing?
Butters
Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
Kyle
These are gas masks, Butters!
Stan
Yeah! If you don't have a gas mask, you're gonna get smallpox or anthrax!
Butters
What?! [frightened] Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
Stan
There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
Butters
Stop breathin'?
Kyle
Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
Butters
Well. Alright, then. [takes in a big gulp of air and holds his breath hard. His head goes cock-eyed. A few seconds later, the bus pulls up. The kids on the bus and Ms. Crabtree wear gas masks as well. Officer Barbrady, wearing a gas mask, gets out of the bus to inspect the boys' backpacks. The boys, including Butters, line up before him, and he inspects Stan's backpack. He pokes at it in a few places and then gives it back to Stan. Butters begins turning blue]
Officer Barbrady
Well okay. Next? [Stan boards the bus and Kyle steps up, giving his backpack to Barbrady. He inspects the backpack quickly and returns it to Kyle] Next? [Kyle boards the bus and Kenny steps up, giving his backpack to Barbrady. He inspects the backpack and pulls out some magazines...] Let's see: Hotties, Juicy, Whoppers... [returns the magazines and backpack to Kenny, who quickly boards the bus. Cartman walks up.] Okay, next? [Cartman hands him the backpack and Barbrady quickly pulls out some scissors in it] A-ha! What the hell are you doin' with this?!
Cartman
Those are my Hootie Owlie Round-Tip Scissors.
Officer Barbrady
These are a weapon! [holds the scissors aloft, away from Cartman]
Cartman
Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
Officer Barbrady
I'll think of a way. Now move along!
Cartman
God-damnit! [boards the bus without his scissors]
Officer Barbrady
Alright, next! [No one steps up. Butters is quite blue now and just stands there. Then he just faints forward] Okay, clear. [the bus starts up, Barbrady boards it, and away it goes.]
South Park Elementary, morning. Along with the regular flag on the flagpole, a larger flag is draped over the front of the school, covering some second-story windows and the center of the school sign. Inside, the kids filter into class and drop off their gas masks along the wall. The door has been fitted with an industrial lock. Tweek enters and locks the door
Tweek
[drops off his mask] Oh, Jesus, man! They're gonna get me! [sits down] Oh Christ! [under his breath] they might - could get me.
Ms. Choksondik
Alright class, as some of you may have heard, the President has asked that American children all send one dollar to the children of Afghanistan. [holds up a sheet of paper with writing on it] So I have a list of addresses and we're goin' to all chip in.
Cartman
HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
Ms. Choksondik
Eric, the Afghan people need our help!
Cartman
Oh, I'm sorry, but I thought we were at war with these assholes!
Wendy
We're at war with terrorists, fatass, not with Afghanistan! And the only reason that you care is that you don't wanna give up the dollar!
Cartman
That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents? [cue soft music. Cartman stands on his seat] Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids. [now standing on his desk] There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
Wendy
The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!
Cartman
Yes, but they're sand monkeys!
Ms. Choksondik
Alright, children, we are all sending a dollar to the kids in Afghanistan! That's it! End of discussion!
Cartman
[drops into his seat angrily] God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!
Afghanistan, day. Adults mill around as fighter planes fly by and bomb a few buildings. Two boys enter from the left and face the camera. They begin Speaking in Dari Persian
Afghan Kyle (named "Akmarh Shulur")
(تمام روز ما را بمباران کنند؟ "Are they gonna be bombing us all day?"
Afghan Stan
.هواشناسی گفته هوا که بارونی شه، بعد از ظهر هم خوب می‌شه "The weather guy has said if it rains, it's gonna be OK in the afternoon."
Afghan Cartman
 !هی! من اینجا هیچی پیدا نمی‌کنم بخورم "Hey, I can't find anything to eat here!"
Afghan Kenny (named Keyvan) says something incomprehensible. Probably suggesting playing basketball.
They move off to play some basketball at a nearby makeshift ball court. The boy who was the first to speak gives the ball to his friend, the second to speak. The friend shoots the basket, but a bomb falls on the backboard, launching the ball away from the court and destroying the backboard and pole
Afghan Boys
Awww!
Afghan Kyle
.حالا پاشو بریم فیلم ببینیم "Well, let's go watch a movie."
then the four move off to their right. They pay for their tickets and head for the doors. A bomb falls on the theater and blows it up]
Awww!
Afghan Kyle
حالا چی کار می‌خوایم بکنیم؟ "What do we do now?"
Afghan Stan
پاشو بریم خونه‌ی ما بازی کنیم. کاری نمی‌تونیم بکنیم که. ببینین بچه‌ها، پدر و مادر من خونه هستن. خیلی متنفرم وقتی بمب می‌اندازن "Let's go play at my house. There's nothing else we can do. See guys, my parents are home. I hate it when they drop bombs."
Afghan Kenny] حالا چی کار کنیم؟ "What do we do now?"
Dialog
The Stan and Kenny counterparts talk. A horse-drawn small SUV pulls up, a man comes out and drops off four letters, one for each boy, and gets back into the driver's seat. The SUV pulls away and the boys look at their letters. As dramatic music plays, the Kyle counterpart opens his letter up, looks inside, flips it over, and lets a dollar float down from it. The other three boys do the same. Akmarh looks at the bill, then up at the death and destruction surrounding the boys, and it's apparent that $4 won't do much to repair any of it. Akmarh looks at the bill again and wonders what to do with it.
The Marsh house, day. The garage has a large flag draping the door. Inside, on the living room couch. Sharon is lying there covered with blankets and watching TV. On the floor around the sofa are bowls, candles, food, and other items. Sharon hasn't been off that couch in a while.
Dialog
Reporter
[on TV] Another high-alert status for terrorists activity this weekend. [SNN - America Fights Back. A news ticker crawls by. Major headlines appear to the left, stock quotes on top, weather forecasts under the crawl] The government said "bad things are likely to happen." [the door bell rings] Meanwhile, the world continues to back down from their support of the United States [dingle] saying that they were really only kidding to begin with.
Stan
[approaching] Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'.
Sharon
Can huh get th'ere 'or me? [Stan goes to open the door.]
Randy
[approaching through the kitchen, stops at the kitchen door] Hey, Sharon? Maybe you should stop watchin' the news for a little bit? [Sharon mutters something] Shu-Sharon, you've been watching CNN for about ah... eight weeks now. Don't you wanna watch somethin' else? [the door closes] Shu-Shu-Sharon? [Stan comes back into view, pulling a box a bit bigger than he is into the living room]
Stan
Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
Sharon
Weh, that's nahice.
Stan
We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! [looks back at Randy] Do you have some scissors to get this open?
Randy
Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?
Stan
Well alright. [pushes the package back towards the front door. Randy returns to the kitchen... Sharon bolts from the sofa as Randy rushes back into the living room]
Randy, Sharon
Big brown package from Afghanistan??!!
The Marsh house, night. Paramedics, fire trucks, the SWAT team, and the FBI are all there. Two klieg lights shine on the package as two Hazmat men approach the package. A crowd of residents looks on. Stan, Cartman and Kenny watch from the front.
Kyle
[approaching] Dude, what's going on?
Stan
We got a package from the kids we sent dollars to. They sent us something back.
Hazmat man
[in white] Prelims show negative, sir.
Official
Then we're gonna have to blow it!
Two SWAT men
[in gray] Yes sir!! [they leave and rig the box so it opens without much damage]
Tweek
AAHH! This is it, man! It's over!
Richard
Tweek, calm down. Have some coffee. [Tweek looks up at Richard. The two SWAT members finish and return to the crowd. Everyone kneels behind the barriers and then cover their heads.]
Official
Open! [one of the SWAT officers presses the remote control and the box pops open. Inside is a goat]
Goat
Mma-a-a-a-a-a-a. [people begin to look up at the goat]
Stan
Oh, it's just a goat. [all rise]
People
Oohhh.
Blond Man
Look, it's a goat.
Man 1
Awww.
Brunet Man
A precious goat.
Goat
Ba-a-a-a-a. [Stan approaches it as soft music plays]
Stan
[now next to the goat] Hey there, little guy.
Official
[steps forward] Stay away from it! Terrorists could have given that goat anthrax or smallpox before sending it over! Johnson!! [another official steps forward and salutes] Check the goat for diseases!
Johnson
Yes sir! [walks over to the goat and begins licking its face. Stan backs away. After a few licks Johnson rises and announces] The goat seems to be clean, sir!
Stan
I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
Cartman
Heh, four dollars for a goat? We got ripped off.
Official
Alright, men, this area is secure. Let's head out! [the various services disperse and drive away in their vehicles. ]
Kyle
Well what are we supposed to do with it?
Goat
Ba-a-a-a-a.
Stan
Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
Kyle
Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
Stan
Kenny?
Kenny
(No fuckin' way, dude!)
Stan
My parents will never let me keep a goat
Cartman
Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
Stan
No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to [removes the return address from the box] take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. [takes the goat's reins and leads it away. The other boys follow]
Goat
Ba-a-a-a-a.
Downtown South Park, night. All building windows have flags draped behind them, and some of the walls have flags on them as well. The post office has two flags on wall-mounted poles. The last postal worker closes up for the night as the boys approach
Kyle
Uh oh, they're closing!
Stan
Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
Postman
Excuse me?
Cartman
It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
Kyle
Yeah.
Postman
Afghanistan? [cautions] H-I'm sorry boys, but our planes aren't flying there.
Stan
They're not.
Goat
Ma-a-a-a-a-a-a.
Postman
The only planes goin' to Afghanistan are the military planes over at the base. I'm sorry. [walks away]
Stan
Well yeah! The military planes. Come on, goat, we'll put you on one of them. [leads the goat away. The others stand there for a second, then catch up to them]
Kyle
[calls out] Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
Stan
I don't care! We're going!
Towelie
[dropping in] Don't forget to bring a towel.
The Boys
Aaagh!
Cartman
Oh no, not Towelie.
Towelie
When goin' someplace new, you should always bring a towel.
Stan
Okay, thanks, Towelie. [rolls his eyes]
Towelie
Do you wanna get high?
Cartman
[quickly] No, we don't wanna get high!!
Towelie
You mean, you don't want Towelie around?
Cartman
That's right!
Towelie
So am I to understand that there's been a ...Towelie ban?... [snorts and starts laughing]
The Boys
[not amused. Kyle covers his eyes] Awww!
Stan
Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
Towelie
Alright, see ya. [walks off]
The military base, night. Jeeps roll in as a battalion is assembled in the parking lot. A large cargo plane receives the vehicles and other cargo
General
Alright, troops. We depart for Afghanistan in five minutes! Let's move out!
Stan
[now in the base with the others] Alright, come on. We just gotta get the goat on one of these planes.
Soldier 1
[off-screen] Isn't this exciting, Tony? [the boys hide behind some boxes nearby] We're finally gonna see some action.
Tony
[the soldiers, in desert fatigues, appear] Yeah, and uh, I hear that as soon as we land we get a USO show.
Soldier 1
We do! [draws close] Stevie Nicks is goin' to perform.
Tony
Hoh, Stevie Nicks. Huh, I love her! [they move on]
Stan
[peeks out] Okay, it's clear. Come on! [moves out with the goat and the other boys. A shadow falls across them]
Soldier
[off screen] Hey you!
Tony
[aims his rifle at the boys] What the hell do you think you're doing here?!
Goat
...Ba-a-a-a-a.
Tony
[chastened, quickly retracts the rifle] H-uh, I'm sorry, Miss Nicks, uh. [looks around] Hey guys, this is Stevie Nicks. [a black soldier walks up]
Soldier 2
Oh wow!
Goat
...Ma-a-a-a-a.
Soldier 3
Uh, can I get a picture?
Soldier 4
Miss Nicks. Over here, Miss Nicks! [takes a picture]
Goat
...Ma-a-a-a-a.
Tony
Oh... M- Miss Nicks, I... I don't wanna bother you, but... could you sing a quick Fleetwood Mac for us. Could ya?
Other Soldiers
Oh yeah. Please. Come on, come on. Please. Yeah.
Goat
...Ma-a-a-a-a. Ma-a-a-a-a.
Soldiers
Oh! No way! That was wild! That was great!
Soldier 3
Wait till I tell my sister about this; she is gonna flip!
Stan
Well, uh, we've gotta get Miss Nicks on the plane to Afghanistan, guys.
Tony
Oh, can we just get a-
Stan
[turns right and walks off] Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
Tony
Oh, sure, we understand. Move along. [the soldiers watch the goat walk away with the boys]
Soldier 3
...She looks great.
Tony
She looks great.
Cargo plane, later. The boys walk up to the plane with the goat and prepare to put in in the cargo hold. A side door is open, with a ramp leading up to the hold
Stan
'K, let's put him on here. [walks up the ramp, pushing the goat along]
Goat
[inside the hold] Ma-a-a-a-a.
Stan
[enters and soothes the goat] Shhh. There we go. You're gonna be okay, goat. You'll be back in Afghanistan in about 20 hours.
Cartman
[he and the other two peek in] Stan, if you're finished having your tearful goodbye with the goat, we'd like to go now, please?
Pilot
Alright, tango clear. [lifts the ramp up and swings it into the cargo hold...]
The Boys
Waaah!
Pilot
Let's head out. [...then closes the door and walks to the cockpit. The boys drop into the hold]
Cartman
[turns around and wrestles with the door] Aw, son of a bitch!
Kyle
[gets up, turns, and pounds at the door] Hey, wait! There are children in here!
Kenny
[rises and moves a bit] (Oh, shit, we're locked in.)
Goat
[inside the hold] Ma-a-a-a-a.
Stan
Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan.
Kyle
[steps toward Stan] Going to Afghanistan? Locked in a small space for 20 hours? How could things get any worse? [poot. Cartman blinks tightly and smiles]
Boys
Awww! [Kyle covers his nose, Kenny draws his hoodstring tight]
Kenny
(Ee-hew-hoo!)
Cartman
[giggles] Uh ho, you guys.
Afghanistan, next day. A cargo plane has landed and the camera pans from the plane to the runway behind it. Another cargo plane lands and rolls to a stop. The large cargo door drops down and the soldiers file out marching
General
Welcome to Afghanistan, troops! Get your gear ready and report to the barracks at o-nine hundred!
Soldiers
Sir yes sir! [they march away. The pilot comes, opens up the small side door, and pulls down the ramp. The boys move out and go down the ramp with their jackets over their noses]
Kyle
Oh God, it was horrible!
Stan
Twenty hours!
Kenny
(God-damn, it stinks like shit!)
Goat
Ma-a-a-a-a! [leaps out and runs off]
Pilot
What the hell?
Kyle
Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
Cartman
It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
Pilot
[leans in and sniffs] I don't smell any- boh! Oh God! [begins choking] Hohhgh! [looks away] Blagh! [convulses] Bleeaagghh [throws up twice and passes out]
Cartman
Uh, whatever!
Kyle
You sonofabitch, Cartman! [begins to walk away, passing Cartman] You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! [Stan passes by]
Cartman
Oh, I'm sorry! Next time I'll just ask my fart nicely if it wouldn't mind staying tucked away for a while!
Stan
[finds the goat next to Kenny] Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home! [pulls out the return address] We have to find this address. [leads the goat off. The other boys follow]
Goat
Ma-a-a-a-a.
A large city in Afghanistan, day. Could be Kabul. Plenty of large building and roads abound, but they all look rundown or beat down - this is a city in decay. The boys walk through the city
Cartman
God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
Kyle
Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
Stan
Hey look! There's a taxi! [horse-drawn, with small back tires. The boys head for it, passing a street performer.]
Performer
[raises his hands] Haa-aa-aa. [the boys into the taxi's back seat]
Stan
[to the driver] Hello. We need to go... [hands the driver the address] here. [the driver says: شما می‌خواین برین خونه؟ "You guys wanna go home?" and whips the horse into action. The taxi moves off]
Cartman
What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
The home of the Afghan boys. The taxi pulls up and drops the South Park boys off, then goes away. The boys approach the door
Kyle
Is this the right house?
Stan
I think so. [steps up and knocks on the door]
Akmarh
[approaches and opens the door] شما چیزی می‌فروشید؟ "You guys selling something?"
Stan
A-ah, hi. We're from America. [Akmarh simply looks back] Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
Akmarh
Goat? [the other Afghan boys show up behind Akmarh]
Goat
Ma-a-a-a-a.
Stan
Here. Wu-we don't want it.
Akmarh
Oh, you want something else? All we had was the goat. Your country bombed everything else.
Stan
No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
Cartman
It was choking on the sweet air of freedom in America, so we brought it back to your crappy country. [the Afghan boys are insulted]
Stan
Oh uh, and here. [pulls out a small flag] Take this American flag as... a gift. [hands it to Akmarh and backs up. Akmarh considers the gift for a few moments, then throws it on the ground and steps back. The fat kid moves up and pours some fuel on it, then the poor kid strikes a match and throws it on the fuel, setting the flag on fire.]
Afghan Boys
Yaaay. [they jump up and down]
Kyle
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Stan
Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
Fat Boy
Huh! !آمریکایی‌ها با خوک می‌خوابن Americans are pig fuckers!
Cartman
What did you call us?!
Akmarh
Your country is the evil empire! Your government wants to rule the world! But your values and your spirituality are in the guh-ter!
Kyle
Then why did you send us the goat?
Boy in Blue Vest
Because, in Afghanistan, we have pride. If you send us something, we must send something in return.
Akmarh
It doesn't mean we don't still hate you. Now, get out of here! [the Afghan boys back up and Akmarh shuts the door]
Stan
Hey! Hey, open the door!
Cartman
I told you! Jawas have no heart.
Kyle
Jawas?
Cartman
You know, sand people.
Stan
How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
Goat
Ma-a-a-a-a.
Kyle
Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
Stan
Alright. [leads the others away. The goat follows. Stan hears the hoofbeats and stops] Oh look, he's following us. It's so sad.
Cartman
[softly] God, I hate you so much, Stan!
Stan
What? [voices rise in the distance (مرگ بر آمریکا! مرگ بر آمریکا "Down with USA" or "Death to America"! The boys look on. The protesters march by the boys and stop, curious about the boys standing there. Stan greets them] Howdy. [the protesters remain motionless]
Kyle
Um... [looks around, then slowly] Greetings from Canada. [now with Canadian accent] Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
Cartman
Ey, what the hell are you talking about?! [Stan and Kyle look at Cartman angrily] I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!
Stan
[buries his face in his hand in disgust and shakes it] Cartman, you stupid asshole! [the crowd roars with anger and ties the four boys and the goat up. Two of the protesters talk about what to do next. One of them ends with]
Protester
...Osama bin Laden! [the others crack up and lead the captives away]
Kyle
Good job, fatass!
Cartman
Dude, don't call me a Canadian! [the protesters lead the captives up a mountain road. A bird in a tree warbles an Arabic song. When the lead protester reaches the tree he shoots the bird, and the bird falls down and away, dead. The trek resumes]
A cave in Afghanistan, day. "Not where Osama bin Laden is." Guards stand outside keeping watch. Inside, six guards interrogate the boys
Stan
You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! [one of the guards says something]
Cartman
Look, I think I can explain everything. You see, my friend Stan here is an oversensitive animal lover. He's got a boner for this goat, a-
Voice
Amaar madmallah [the guards look up, then line up at either side of the cave entrance. A lanky figure walks in]
Osama bin Laden
[swaying as he walks in] Oooo, alamalamalamalaah.
Kyle
Oh crap, it's him!
Goat
Ma-a-a-a-a.
Osama bin Laden
[pacing before the boys] Amalama hamahamahama? [draws close to Cartman] Una Haqa mala
Cartman
[leaning away] Ogh! Dude, it's called deodorant, okay? It's not expensive.
Osama bin Laden
Haqaama hamahalahamahaqa. [the guards move off and return with studio equipment - two spot lights and television camera. The cameraman announces that they're ready to tape (!اوساما خان، حاضره "Osama sir, we're ready.". Osama sways over to his spot. The cameraman gives a signal and several makeup artists rush in for some quick touch-ups, then leave. The cameraman gets behind the camera and gives the signal to start talking] U bataqataqaa maladala. Ameriqa la tabakabaka haka haqadaqadaqa [laughs] Haqahaqa, daaqadaqa!
Cameraman
Aaaaand... cut! [Osama grins and the guards clap. Osama takes a small bow and tosses the mic away, then walks off]
Stan
Dude, these people are insane.
The Marsh house, night. Sharon has resumed watching SNN on the sofa
SNN reporter
...as more and more case of terrorist-related AIDS continues to grow. And this just in: the Taliban has apparently taken American civilians as hostages. The Taliban has just released this videotape [the boys and the goat in their chairs, flanked by two Taliban guards], in which it is clearly visible that they have indeed captured [closeup of the goat, with Kenny to the left] Stevie Nicks. Miss Nicks appears to be in good spirits, though her whereabouts are unknown.
Randy
[pops in from the kitchen] Hey, Sh- Sharon? Ha- have you seen Stan in the last couple... days?
Sharon
[raises her head a bit] Yes. I just saw him.
Randy
Oh okay. [slowly moves back into the kitchen]
Afghanistan, day. The general and his troops are watching the same report
SNN Reporter
With Stevie Nicks in captivity, the other members of Fleetwood Mac have been hidden so the Taliban can't get to them as well. [the soldiers are crestfallen]
Tony
They... took Stevie Nicks?
Soldier 2
Bastards! Heartless, gutless bastards!
General
Alright men! Grab your guns and your Bibles! We are going to get Miss Nicks back!
Soldiers
[cheering] Hooray!!! [some of them have their arms raised]
The Afghan boys' home, at that moment
SNN Reporter
The Taliban's video also shows what appears to be four American children in captivity, though they could just be French.
Akmarh
[rising] We have to help them.
Fat Boy
Do you say??
Akmarh
They are not espies. They came to give us our goat back.
Boy in Blue Vest
Screw them! They are evil Americans!
Akmarh
I know! But if we don't help the innocent ones, then we are no better than the Americans are.
Fat Boy
Help the Americans? That doesn't make sense.
Akmarh
Dude, we are espeaking English right now. Does that make sense??
Boy in Blue Vest
Alright, let's go. [they pick up their rifles and exit]
Fat Boy
!ای لعنت "Oh, goddammit!"
Osama's cave, day. Inside, at table, the Taliban guards are celebrating Osama's birthday. The guards and Osama wear party hats
Osama bin Laden
Aw, jihad, jihad. [the boys look at each other for reactions, and the alarms go off] Oh? [walks over to his security screen and sees the Americans converging outside the cave entrance, then runs around unsure what to do] Oh, oh! Ameriqa haqa haqa! Dursha! Dapadapadapa! [the guards respond and give each other orders while moving out. Osama pulls out a walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Hulagugla hugagugahagahaa!
Outside Osama's cave, day. The American and Taliban forces engage each other in combat.
Inside Osama's cave. Osama is still giving orders
Osama bin Laden
Qubada durqaana Ameriqanab! Qubada durqaana- [a grill next to the boys rises, and the Afghan boys climb out]
Stan
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
Osama bin Laden
Boy in Blue Vest
Shh. We've come to save you.
Kyle
But I thought you hate us.
Boy in Blue Vest
We do. [Osama talks away, and the boys slip out quietly with the goat. Cartman decides not to join them, and walks towards Osama]
Kyle
Cartman, where are you going??
Cartman
I'm gonna go take care of this prick!
Kyle
Cartman, he's crazy!
Cartman
He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. [walks off]
Osama bin Laden
A flippity flappity floop! Jihad jihad!
Cartman
Mehah... [bites on some food] What's up, bin Laden?
Osama bin Laden
Arrrrrrrrrrrubadubaduba! Durbadurba haq!
Cartman
Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray. [quickly rushes for a prayer rug and rolls it out, then kneels and bows deeply a few times.] Allah, Allah, m'heh
Osama bin Laden
Taba haqa?? [goes for his prayer rug and does as Cartman does] Allah Allah Allah, Allah hakadurrpa durpa adurpa hagalah [Cartman brings out a huge mallet and smashes it on Osama's head. Osama's head rings like a bell, then he looks at Cartman and aims his rifle at him]
Cartman
Uh oh! Mmm-mm! [kisses Osama and tumbles away]
Outside Osama's cave, day. The American and Taliban forces are still fighting. The seven kids and the goat emerge from the cave
Akmarh
We will have to be quick! The Americans are attacking!
Kyle
Where do we go? [they look around]
Akmarh
Get down! [all boys hit the floor and hide their faces. A bomb blows up in front of them. When the smoke clears, Kenny and the poor Afghan boy are both dead, both riddled with bullets]
Boy in Blue Vest
!اوه الله! کشتن کیوانو "Oh, my God! They killed Keyvan!"
Akmarh
!تو، دیوث "You bastards!" [Stan and Kyle look at each other. Akmarh gets his rifle and fires away at American helicopters] You... murdering Americaaans!!
Stan
Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
Akmarh
America DID eh-start this war! They eh-started it YEARS ago, when they put their military bases on Muslim holy lands!
A forest near the cave, at that moment. Osama bin Laden slinks around looking for Cartman. He stops next to a small bush. As bin Laden looks around the bush skittles away, then stops. Bin Laden sees the bush has moved and growls at it, aims his rifle, and walks up to it - four steps. The bush moves again, then stops. Bin Laden catches up in three steps. The bush moves again, then bin Laden tales a step forward. The bush moves again, then bin Laden tales another step forward. The bush leaps and bin Laden holds it in mid-air as Cartman drops to the ground. We get a view of the gun on Cartman's face from Cartman's perspective
Osama bin Laden
[tossing the bush away] Ramadan!
Cartman
Hey look! An infidel! [bin Laden quickly turns around]
Osama bin Laden
Wuut? Peitoqaba! [Cartman gets up and pulls bin Laden's pants down. Osama looks stunned. A magnifying glass pops up over bin Laden's genitals, then another, then another... nine in all, and the penis is finally visible. A sign pops up... "Tiny, ain't it?" A few seconds later the sign and magnifiers go down and Osama pulls his pants up]
Cartman
So that's what this is all about?
Osama bin Laden
Ishta fatwa open sesame!
Cartman
[climbs up bin Laden and kisses him] Mmmm! Tastes like chicken. The ass of a chicken!
Osama bin Laden
Proila foqabam!
Cartman
Woohoo! [zips away, leaving a dust cloud front of bin Laden. Bin Laden gives chase, leaving his own dust cloud.]
Outside Osama's cave, day. The fighting continues. Amid the fighting, the general crosses the battlefield.
General
We're coming, Miss Nicks! Hang on!
Goat
Ma-a-a-a! Ma-a-a-a!
Outside Osama's cave, day. The South Park boys line up opposite the Afghan boys. Stan faces Akmarh, Kyle faces the boy in blue vest.
Kyle
All right, I've had just about enough of this! They told us in school, and on TV, that most people in Pakistan and Afghanistan like America.
Boy in Blue Vest
And you believe it? It is not just the Taliban that hates America. Over a third of the world hates America!
Stan
But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
Boy in Blue Vest
Because, you don't realize that a third of the world hates you!!!
Stan
[considers the argument...] ...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
Akmarh
You're butt-holes!
Stan, Kyle
You're buttholes!
Outside Osama's cave, day. Osama and Cartman are now out in the open desert. Osama resumes slinking around
Female voice
Youhoo.
it's Cartman seated on a camel, dressed in a purple chador. Bin laden takes one look and he goes nuts over what he sees. His eyes bug out as he goes horizontal
Cartman
Haduqaduqaduqa. [Osama's tongue has rolled out to the floor. He tugs it and it rolls up like a classroom projection screen] Huqadukadukadukaduuu. [Osama whistles and then lustily howls like a wolf as he stomps his foot down on the ground. Cartman hops off the camel, walks some distance, and bats his eyes at bin Laden. Osama takes big steps towards Cartman, and the camera alternates between the two. Bin Laden stops short of Cartman... and leaps over him, landing on the camel's neck. Bin Laden starts kissing the camel all over, and Cartman removes his veil, looks at bin Laden, then looks at the camera]
Osama bin Laden
[on bended knee] Oh bella, bella falafel. [brings out a bouquet of flowers]
Mi amore. Fatwa, fatwa. [Cartman holds up a sign with a screw and a baseball on it, then puts it away. Bin Laden hops away, then returns with a table, two chairs, two glasses and some wine, and sets up a table for two. He sets the camel down on one chair and sits on the other one opposite the camel. He then serves up some glasses of wine]
Ahh, de vino! Mi fatwa! J'ai une fatwa! [Cartman holds up four other signs: a jack and donkey, a pile of feces and a bald head, a rooster and lollipop, and Barbra Streisand]
Outside Osama's cave, day. The boys have moved away from the cave entrance, and the fat Afghan boy has rejoined them. Beyond them the two forces continue fighting
Kyle
Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
Boy in Blue Vest
It's better than a civilization that spends its time watching millionaires walk down the red carpet at the Emmys!
Stan
...He's got us there, dude. [pan out to see more fighting]
Tony
[finds the goat and picks it up] I got her. I got Stevie Nicks. [carries it away. The Americans retreat, but continue firing away]
Goat
Me-e-e-eh.
Nearby... Osama's grinning widely at the camel. Cartman walks up in a different costume - that of the fussy movie director.
Cartman
There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! [hauls bin Laden away.]
Osama bin Laden
Oh, dapidiuta ako. [Bin laden manages a wave good-bye at the camel.]
Cartman
Hur-ry, get into wardrobe! [bin Laden goes behind the walll and changes clothes. Cartman taps his foot impatiently] Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?! [bin Laden comes out dressed as Uncle Sam] Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.
Osama bin Laden
Haqa hamahama.
Cartman
Come on! The cameras are ready! [pulls bin Laden to his mark. Behind them, eight Taliban soldiers fire away at the Americans] Alright, there we go. Let's roll cameras. [walks off and returns with a director's megaphone and a firecracker] Oh, and here's your microphone. [hands Osama the firecracker]
Osama bin Laden
[the Taliban soldiers see Uncle Sam and approach him] Ogh. America adirqadirqa- [looks around. The soldiers fire away at him. Bin Laden staggers, then looks at the object in his hand. Other Taliban soldiers rush in to see, and they all recognize whom they just shot.] Uh ohhh.
Osama and the Taliban Soldiers
HAAAAAAGH! [the firecracker explodes, killing all the soldiers around it. Only Osama is left there at the point of impact, sitting on the ground, with his teeth dangling like piano keys. They play a few notes]
General
We've done it! The Taliban is destroyed!
Soldiers
Hoorayyy!!
Kyle
Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
Osama bin Laden
[flaps his lips with his finger, making some noise] Terrorists is the craziest peoples. Eheeee! [shows his teeth. An American soldier walks up behind bin Laden and dispatches him with one last shot]
Soldier
I got him! I got him!
Boy in Blue Vest
Well, it looks like the Taliban and bin Laden are finally out of power.
Akmarh
Yeup, you don't need us anymore. [they turn and walk away]
Stan
Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing. [the Afghan boys turn around] Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
Kyle
Yeah.
Boy in Blue Vest
That's fine. But we still hate you. [the Afghan boys turn and walk away again]
Stan
Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
Akmarh
[the Afghan boys look again] Maybe. In time. [they turn once again and walk off]
Kyle
I'm confused.
USO concert. The stage is set amid the pup tents and soldiers clamor around in the audience. "VICTORY!" The general takes the stage
General
Great job, troops! Once again we have killed our enemies!
Soldier 5
[cheering] Hooray!
Soldier 6
Hooray! Yeah, we sure did!
General
The world is now safe, thanks to you. And so now, as promised, here is Fleetwood Mac with Stevie Nicks!
Soldiers
Whoa. Yeah. [the goat, dressed to look like Stevie Nicks, approaches the mic.]
Fleetwood Mac
Just like the wild winged bird sings a song-
Stand back, she's singin'.
Goat
Maaa
Fleetwood Mac
Baby
Goat
Maaa
Fleetwood Mac
Babe
Goat
Maa-ha [the concert continues. The three boys watch the performance.]
Stan
Come on, let's go get to the plane. [turns left and walks away. The others follow. On the way there, Stan sees a flag on the ground and approaches it. He goes down on one knee, picks up the little flag, blows the dust off it, sets it into the ground, takes off his jacket, and wraps it around the base of the flag ]
Kyle
[approaching with Cartman] Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
Stan
No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
Kyle
Yeah.
Stan
[rises, steps back, and salutes] Go America.
Kyle
[salutes] Go America. [lowers his right arm] Go Broncos. [moves off]
Stan
[follows] Yeah, go Broncos.
Cartman
Yeah. [follows the other two out]
End of Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants

How to Eat with Your Butt
South Park Elementary School Gym, day. Stan, without his hat, is seated on a stool, none too pleased, before a backdrop of a meadow. Behind the photographer are the kindergartners and Mr. Adler's class
Photographer
Okay, now lift your chin a little. [no change on Stan's face] Look right here. Right here. [points at the camera lens] Hey, where's my smile? Come on, I bet you got a smile for me. I-I'm startin' to see a smile. [Stan doesn't smile] There it is. [FLASH!] Okay great, next.
Stan
[reaches for his hat and puts it on] I didn't smile. [hops off the stool and walks away. A wider view shows Ms. Choksondik's class in line off to the right. The kids move forward. Butters heads for the stool]
Kyle
I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
Butters
[in dress shirt and tie, holds out his palms] Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. [pulls out a comb and some gel, dabs the gel on the comb, and combs his hair back. Four strokes, and he's done]
Photographer
Okay, smile [Butters smiles, a lock of his hair goes up, and he blinks. Then the picture is taken, and Butters opens his eyes] Okay, next? [Butters hops off; Bebe, wearing heavy makeup, approaches and hops onto the stool]
Stan
[joins Kyle at the end of the line] Did you go yet?
Kyle
No. This is taking forever.
Cartman
[rushes up, giddily breathless] You guys! You guys! This is sooo funny!
Kyle
What, Cartman?
Cartman
Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! [points]. Kenny, Kenny, over here! [Kenny comes in looking as Cartman described, with his hands on the floor and his feet in the air, laughing uncontrollably. After Kenny stands still, Cartman roars with laughter]
Kyle
It isn't that funny, Cartman.
Cartman
Yes it is! [while this is going on, the other kids get their pictures taken, Token being the last one. He hops off the stool and walks away.]
Ms. Choksondik
Next in line! Come on, let's keep it moving, kids! [Kyle walks up to the stool]
Cartman
...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
Photographer
[Kyle sits for the camera] Take off your hat, please.
Kyle
But I never take off my hat.
Photographer
Come on now, I bet your parents want a picture of YOU lookin' natural.
Kyle
This is how I look natural.
Ms. Choksondik
Kyle, we're taking pictures without hats today!
Kyle
[angrily] Crap. [takes off his hat to reveal big red bushy hair]
Photographer
Smile! Come on, where's that smile? Is it gonna kill you to smile? I see a smile. [Kyle gives a small grin, and the picture is taken. He goes back to being angry, re-dons his hat and hops off the stool] Next!
Kyle
Gay-ass. [Cartman hops on, takes off his hat and quickly strikes a pose]
Photographer
[takes the picture] Very nice. Okay, last one? [hops off laughing as Kenny approaches]
Cartman
Uh oh. [laughs]
Photographer
Okay, have a seat, young man. [both Cartman and Kenny chuckle as Kenny sets himself down] Well, okay, lookin' great. Now where's that smile? Come on, give me a nice, wide smile. Wider. Perfect! [FLASH!]
Cartman
Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
Photographer
Should be about four days.
Cartman
Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
South Park Elementary, four days later, day. Inside, in Ms. Choksondik's class, Cartman is fidgeting rather loudly in his desk
Cartman
Heh, c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon! C'mon c'mon c'mon!
Ms. Choksondik
Alright, class, I have your school photos to hand out-
Cartman
[bouncing in his seat] YES! YES!
Ms. Choksondik
Most of them are very nice. But, apparently, one of you thinks it's fun to spoil their school pictures [Kenny looks around], and thinks he's a comedian. That person will be spending the afternoon in the principal's office!
Kenny
(Aww, that's bullshit!)
Ms. Choksondik
School photos aren't for joking around, so you aren't getting your photo back, Butters! [thrusts the photo out for a close-up]
Butters
Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.
Ms. Choksondik
For the rest of you, I think your pictures turned out very nicely.
Butters
But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! [the others get their photos and review them]
Cartman
[rushes up and takes Kenny's photos] Let me see! [returns to his seat. Stan and Kyle look at Cartman curiously while Kenny looks on angrily]
Butters
[catches up to Ms. Choksondik as she sits at her chair] Bu-but Teacher, I didn't mean to look stupid in my picture. Honest!
Cartman
[opens Kenny's envelope and looks at the photo, then roars with laughter] Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!
Kenny
(You've ever done?!)
Cartman
[Laughs] Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! [laughs some more]
Ms. Choksondik
Eric, calm down. I'm trying to yell at Butters!
Cartman
Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
Ms. Choksondik
You know very well my name isn't Chokesonrocks, it's Choksondik! Say it right or you can go to the principal's with Butters!
Cartman
I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
Butters
I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
Ms. Choksondik
Your mother is waiting for you in the principal's office. [points towards the door]
Butters
My mom? [turns around and walks out] Oh, sweet Jesus!
Cartman
Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny. [Kenny looks over] I just had the greatest idea... ever!
Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. A receptionist in blue suit sits at her desk. The doors open and Cartman enters
Receptionist
Welcome to South Park Milk Company. Can I help you?
Cartman
Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? [stifles a laugh]
Receptionist
Oh, of course. Printing those photos on our milk really does help. Do you have the photo with you?
Cartman
Yes, I have it right hmya. [shows her Kenny's school photo]
Receptionist
[takes the photo] O-okay, great. We'll print it immediately.
Cartman
You will? [tries not to laugh, but some escapes] Ah. [stifles another laugh] Oh, ah, thank you for your help.
Receptionist
Sure. If I could get a description of the child to print underneath the photo? [Cartman stops in his tracks and turns around]
Cartman
Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye. [sniggers, then laughs] Brown eye! [laughs some more under his breath]
Receptionist
Okay, brown eye...
Cartman
And, and big rosy cheeks! [laughs some more]
Receptionist
...Full cheeks...
Cartman
[cracks up] Full cheeks! [laughs] Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! [cracks up]
Stan's house, day. A TV is heard.
Reporter
Ms. Hamilton was the fourth person to be run over by a motorcycle this week, leaving a city to ponder, who will be next? [Stan and Kyle are on the sofa eating popcorn. The phone rings, and Kyle answers it]
Kyle
Hello?
Cartman
[between the laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! [laughs uncontrollably]
Kyle
Hello?
Cartman
[more laughter] ...You guys!... [more laughter]
Kyle
[getting annoyed] Cartman?
Cartman
[more laughter] You guys! You guys! You guys! Hurry. [hangs up]
Stan
What's he want?
Kyle
[pissed off] I don't know. Let's go see. [they walk off]
Cartman's house, minutes later. Cartman can be heard laughing inside as Stan and Kyle approach his door. Kyle rings the doorbell and Cartman answers, still laughing.
Kyle
Why'd you call us?
Cartman
Come on. Come on. [whispers] Come on.[leads the way] Oho, this is so sweet! [still laughing as he walks to the sofa and picks up a milk carton] You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!
Stan
Goddamnit Cartman, what?! [Cartman hands him the carton and erupts in laughter as Stan and Kyle look it over]
Kyle
...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
Cartman
Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! [falls to the floor, pounding the carpet with his fists in hysterics]
Stan
That isn't funny, Cartman.
Cartman
Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
Kyle
No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
Cartman
No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
A house in Wisconsin. A woman enters her kitchen with some groceries and sets them on the kitchen counter next to the sink. She pulls them out one by one, but stops when she pulls out the milk carton
Martha
[gasps] Oh my God. Oh my God! [holds the carton close. Her face looks like a derriere] Steven! Steven, come quick!
Steven
[rushes in. His face does also.] What is it, Martha?
Martha
Look. It's him! It's... our son.
Steven
Our ssson!
Dairy Gold Milk Company, day, a few days later. The Wisconsin couple are at the Dairy Gold Milk Company, talking to the receptionist. Their "s" and sometimes "th" comes out sounding like a raspberry
Martha
...and so that's when I called out to my husband. I just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little Tommy.
Receptionist
[stunned] ... yes, I see. [pics up a milk carton carton] Uh, but the child on the milk carton was reported missing, not found.
Steven
We realize that. But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We're pretty certain that it's our boy, considering his physical appearance. Martha and I have the... same condition.
Receptionist
...Riiight.
Steven
You may not have realized this, but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
Receptionist
[flatly] ...Really?
Steven
Yes.
Martha
Steven and I have a condition called "torsonic polarity syndrome." It's a birth defect that's passed on genetically.
Steven
Over eleven people worldwide suffer from TPS.
Receptionist
[flatly] Hmm, hmm, that's am-, that's amazing.
Steven
Martha and I were lucky enough to meet each other at a TPS convention in France.
Receptionist
So... do you have heads down where your rear ends should be?
Steven
No no, don't be silly. You see, with TPS, the birth defect is on the exterior only. Behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue, eyes, nasal passages...
Receptionist
Well, Mr. and Mrs...
Steven
Uh, Thompssson.
Receptionist
...Thompson. Uh, I'll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.
Martha
Oh, wonderful! Steven, we're goin' to see Tommy again!
Steven
Now, Martha, what did I say about getting our hopesss up?
Martha
You're right. You're right.
Cartman's house, moments later. Cartman is laughing his ass off on the sofa when Stan and Kyle return to see him.
Kyle
...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
Cartman
[gets up and hops off the sofa] Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God. [tries to compose himself] Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right? [wipes some moisture from his face] And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. [cracks up again]
Stan
...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
Cartman
No, nonono! Because apparently these two people... also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be! [waits a second, then roars with laughter again]
Kyle
...Nuh uh.
Cartman
Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!! [roars with laughter again. The doorbell rings and all three look at the door] Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh. [walks over to answer the door. He stops and stifle a laugh] Just- okay [chuckles] No. [takes a few steps] Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. [steps to the door, takes a deep breath, and opens it, grinning]
Martha
[greeting] Hello, we're Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. [Cartman stands there grinning, then it disappears into a frown. A few moments later he turns around dejected.]
Cartman
Oh God.
Kyle
[starts laughing, but stifles it with his hands over his mouth] Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!
Stan
No way! [Cartman turns around and looks again, frowning]
Steven
We understand you've seen our son. [Cartman looks speechless, then turns around looking lost]
Cartman
[very softly] Oh my... God. [walks away from the door quite afraid, then begins to ascend the stairs stammering nonsense]
Stan
Cartman, where are you going?? [Cartman keeps walking. The Thompsons simply shrug their shoulders, looking at each other]
Martha
[holds up the milk carton] Uh, excuse me, boys, do you know anything about this?
Kyle
[giggles a bit] Uh
Stan
Oh boy.
Kyle
Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
Stan
Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
Martha
[Steven puts his arm around her shoulder] Oh thank you. Thank you! [they turn and walk away. The receptionist waits for them on the walkway]
Receptionist
Well?
Steven
They said to inquire four houses down.
Martha
Let's hurry! [leads the way down the street. Steven and the receptionist follow]
Cartman's room, moments later. Cartman is at a loss for words and looks scared. The door opens and Kyle and Stan walk in.
Kyle
Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
Stan
Yeah, you missed them turning around.
Cartman
You guys, something's wrong.
Stan
What?
Cartman
I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
Kyle
[quizzically] Blew a funny fuse?
Cartman
[turns to face them] It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded. [turns away] I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
Outside, on the sidewalk. Six kids are walking along: Kyle, Stan, Token, Clyde, Craig, and Tweek
Clyde
You mean they both have butts instead of heads?
Stan
Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
Token
How do they eat?
Stan
How the hell should we know? [the kids stop before a house]
Kyle
Butters! Hey Butters! You have to check this out!
Butters
[opens his bedroom window and looks down] W-what?
Kyle
You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
Stan
There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
Butters
Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
Stan
But dude, you gotta see it; it's hysterical!
Linda
Butters can't come out and play, boys. He thinks it's funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that I have to pay for!
Butters
Huh, but I told you mom: ah-I didn't mean to look... like a jackass, eh. It just happened.
Linda
You made a goofy face!
Butters
No! That's just what I look like. See?
Linda
[turns around and looks up] ...Don't you make that face at me, young man!
Butters
I'm not makin' a face, mom!
Linda
Stop it!
Craig
...Come on, we wanna see the ass people.
Kyle
Alright. [the kids turn left and walk away]
Linda
Fine Butters! If you don't wanna stop making that stupid face at me, you can just stay in your room for another week! [goes inside and shuts the door.]
Butters
Another week? [turns around and drops down] I hate my stupid face.
Mr. Mackey's office, day. Cartman is on the couch laying on his back...
Mr. Mackey
Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
Cartman
Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
Mr. Mackey
Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.
Cartman
Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, I see, well... Well, what did you used to think was funny?
Cartman
You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die... [Mr. Mackey is shocked by the last one] This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
Mr. Mackey
Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin' so scary that nothin' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.
Cartman
[turns over to look at Mr. Mackey] So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
Mr. Mackey
It's possible, hm'kay? [Cartman turns over and lays on his back again] But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, "Friends" [laughs at the unexpected humor in his own statement]. Ohokahay, huhuh.
Cartman
Ugh.
The McCormick house, later. The Thompsons' car is parked outside, on the street. Inside, the McCormicks, the Thompsons and the receptionist are seated around the coffee table. A brick has replaced two of its legs. Kenny stands beside his mother.
Mrs. McCormick
...and so you see, our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton.
Martha
Yes. Yes, I see.
Mrs. McCormick
Kenny, don't you think you owe the Thompsons an apology? [Kenny just stares at them]
Martha
...No, it was foolish for us to get our hopes up.
Steven
It was just such a coincidence, considering the photo. You may not have realized this, but Martha and I have buttocks where our heads should be.
Stuart and Mrs. McCormick
Really?
Receptionist
Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, how long has it been since you've seen your son?
Steven
Tommy disappeared when he was only seven.
Martha
[leans into Steven's right shoulder, sobbing, and he comforts her] Oh, Steven, it's like it's all happening all over again. [sobs uncontrollably]
Mrs. McCormick
[rises to soother her also] There there now. [looks around, then walks off]
Receptionist
Please, Mrs. Thompson, it'll be alright. [Martha continues sobbing] Listen, the South Park Dairy Company is the country's largest. We find lost children all the time. [Mrs. McCormick returns with a box of tissues. Martha takes one and blows her "nose" with it. Mr. McCormick walks off again, and Martha resumes sobbing] We can help you find Tommy with the company's database!
Mrs. McCormick
[holds her arms out as if to keep Martha away] Yes, well, aaah-I'll help you find your son. Just stop cryin', Please, for the love of God, stop cryin'!
Martha
[blows her nose again and sobs some more, then tries to compose herself] Ah, agh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [blows her nose]
Receptionist
Mr. Thompson, how did your son become missing? Was he abducted?
Steven
Yes. He was in the care of our nanny at the time.
Martha
The nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still don't know why. [Stan and Token are now looking in through the window. Kyle joins them. Martha blows her nose] We think perhaps she wanted a child of her own. [a couple of hands try to get a grip on the window sill]
Receptionist
And this was back in Wisconsin? [Craig soon rises into view outside]
Steven
Yes, but we last heard the nanny was heading west. [Token, Craig, and Kyle start laughing. Tweek pops up and pushes Craig out of the way to have a good look. Stan laughs, and Craig climbs up on Tweek.] That's why we thought Colorado made sssssense.
Martha
We've tried every avenue to find him, [Officer Barbrady happens by and says something. The kids jump] but, we've never tried the milk company. [Stan seems to tell Barbrady to come over and look at the ass people.]
Receptionist
Well you just give us a try. I think you'll find that South Park Milk [Barbrady approaches] is not only the best resource for finding kids, [Barbrady's eyes widen] but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer. [Barbrady walks away and calls out to some people, then returns to the window]
Martha
Thank you. Thank you so much for helping us. [Mr. Garrison walks by and looks in, then seems to say "Holy crap!"]
Steven
This certainly is a friendly town. [Sheila shows up behind Kyle] You've all been sssssso wonderful. [Chef shows up behind Mr. Garrison]
Martha
Yes, I'm so grateful I just wanna cry again.
Stuart and wife, and Receptionist
[they hold their palms out] NO!
The Bijou Theater, day. "Grossout Comedy 8" is playing there. Inside, Cartman sits amid a bunch of older folk
Male 1
Dude, why are you wearing Shalayna's panties? [the audience laughs; Cartman sits there, glum, his head resting on his left hand.]
Male 2
I have to wear Shalayna's panties. Lisa's were in the wash. [the audience laughs; Cartman just blinks.] Look, can we just get this over with?
Male 1
But dude, I can't French-kiss him. He's my grandpa! [the audience laughs]
Male 2
Come on, dude.
Male 1
Oh, alright Here it goes. Come'ere, Grandpa.
Audience
Aww
Cartman
[out of sorts] Oh, dude, oh.
Jonesy
[noticing] Dude, what's wrong with you?
Cartman
Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
Male 1
Well, I'm glad that's over with. We'd better go back to the house now to see how Chris is doing. [Cartman fakes a laugh and the audience turns to look at him. Cartman manages a few weak laughs, then sinks in his seat]
Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. An official leads the Thompsons through the factory. Cows are lined up in their stalls eating from personal troughs.
President
Uh Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, as President of the South Park Milk Company, I want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons.
Steven
Please, please. It's not your fault.
President
Ye-yes, but here at South Park Milk we strive for excellence. For instance, we are now entering the extraction room. [stops] As you can see, we keep it close to the refrigeration room. That way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible. [commercial music comes up] That's why some say South Park milk tastes like you're suckin' it right from the cow's tits yourself.
Martha
Amazing.
President
[a worker comes by with some food] Here, try a glass of our cold Vitamin D. And our fresh scones. [the Thompsons take some milk and scones and start eating]
Steven
Delicious.
Martha
Oh, excuse me. A little... difficult to drink with our condition. [the couple set their milks back on the tray and the worker walks out.]
Steven
Martha and I actually have buttocks where our heads should be.
President
Really? Well. And in here we have our Missing Child Resource Center. [leads them into a large darkened room]
Martha
Oh my, isn't this impressive?
President
Yes. With the Kelrom 4000, Mrs. Garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases.
Mrs. Garthunk
[the receptionist] We'll start the computer on a data search. Now, when did your son turn up missing?
Steven
Well, it was 1982. Tommy was only six at the time.
Mrs. Garthunk
Alright then. Computer...
Computer
Workiiing.
Mrs. Garthunk
Run a scan of missing children since 1982. Check for physical birth defects called TPS.
Computer
TPS. Torsonic Polarity Syndrome. Child missing since 1982. Workiiing.
President
So you actually haven't seen your son in over 20 years?
Martha
That's right.
Mrs. Garthunk
But then, why did you think the picture of Kenny was him. Wouldn't your son be much older now?
Steven
Yes, but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo, [takes a bite out of the scone and chews it] we assumed someone had seen him since we did.
Martha
[pulls out a baby picture] This is the only photo we have of our little Tommy. [in diapers in a crib, looking like he's just finished eating]
Mrs. Garthunk
It's gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids.
President
Well, why don't we let Mrs. Garthunk do her work, and I'll take you two out for some good old Colorado chili. [walks out. The Thompsons follow him]
Steven
We don't really like chili; it makes us throw up.
Cartman's house, living room, day. The door bell rings and Eric answers it. Jimmy stands at the entrance
Jimmy
Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.
Cartman
Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! [goes inside, and Jimmy follows, closing the door]
Jimmy
What's this all about?
Cartman
Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
Jimmy
Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.
Cartman
I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
Jimmy
Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.
Cartman
Okay, let me have it.
Jimmy
Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
Cartman
Okay, why?
Jimmy
Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch... eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. [Cartman doesn't respond]
Cartman
...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
Jimmy
Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.
Cartman
Who's there?
Jimmy
Orange.
Cartman
Orange who?
Jimmy
Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
Cartman
[stares back] ...naw, that didn't work either.
Jimmy
Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock.
Cartman
Who's there?
Jimmy
An interrupting ca'ow.
Cartman
An interrupting cow who
Jimmy
[interrupting] Moooooo! [...no response.] ...What a terrific audience. [the two of them stand in the middle of the living room looking at each other]
Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. Mrs. Garthunk is still at the computer doing her search
Mrs. Garthunk
Hah, let's see. The Dallas-Ft. Wroth area. I haven't tried there yet. Computer?
Computer
Workiiing.
Mrs. Garthunk
Scan for any children reported found in the Dallas-Ft. Wroth area, with a facial deformity.
Computer
Workiiing. [some computer noises] Negative.
Mrs. Garthunk
Ugh. This is hopeless! ...Wait a minute, let's try it this way: Computer?
Computer
Workiiing.
Mrs. Garthunk
Scan databanks for children who reported their parents missing.
Computer
Workiiing. [some computer noises] One million six thousand hits.
Mrs. Garthunk
Alright, then break it down to claims in the past twenty years.
Computer
Workiiing. [some computer noises] Three hundred twenty-one thousand hits.
Mrs. Garthunk
Alright, now run a scan on homogenized versus pasteurized skim milk.
Computer
In skim form, homogenized has longer shelf life by 2.3 weeks.
Mrs. Garthunk
Okaaay, okay, now give me a breakdown of people who are seeking their parents who also suffer from a disease called T P S.
Computer
Torsonic Polarity Syndrome, plus, a claim to not know parents: one match
Mrs. Garthunk
Bingo. Do you have a photo
Computer
Printiiing. [the screen reads "Processing". A picture starts appearing on screen]
Mrs. Garthunk
My God. Oh my God!
Sidewalk, day. Six boys walk down the street again, only Kenny has replaced Tweek among the boys. They stop at Butters' house again,and again, Kyle calls out.
Kyle
Butters! Hey Butters!
Butters
[opens his windows; has a paper bag over his head] Hehyeah?
Kyle
They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
Butters
Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
Stan
Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
Butters
Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to [raises his hand high] here with me.
Stephen
Butters? Are you ready to stop with the stupid faces?
Butters
[hops down to the floor] I sure am, Dad!
Stephen
Alright, you can take the paper bag off.
Butters
[removes the bag] Thanks, Dad! Ah I'm sorry I was bad-
Stephen
Oh, very funny, young man! You think it's clever to make yourself up like a girl?!
Butters
Hububut Dad, ah I didn't lick a-
Stephen
Did you use your mother's makeup?! She's gonna be furious!
Butters
I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-
Stephen
Put that bag back on!
Butters
[subdued] Yes, sir. [slips the bag over his head again]
Kyle
Dude, that poor kid. [walks off]
Clyde
Yeah, we gotta remember to kick his ass tomorrow. [turns with the other boys and follows Kyle off. Butters slams his windows shut]
Cartman's room, day. Cartman sits on his bed dejected. He's unwrapped a box and a gun sits on his bed to his left, a notepad and pencil to his right. He picks up the pad and pencil and writes...
Cartman
Dear Mom: I can no longer stand to be without a sense of humor. Without laughter, the world is a cold and sad place, and I can't go out to face it anymore. Please tell everyone why I won't be at school.
He sets the notepad down and looks at it for a moment, then he reaches over for the gun. He opens his mouth and puts the barrel of the gun in... and bites it off. It's a chocolate gun, and he sets the remainder down on the bed again
Cartman
And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
He picks up the chocolate again and takes another bite. Then he looks at the box the gun came in
Cartman
Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.
Dairy Gold Milk Company, day. A TV 4 news van and crew are present. Some of the factory workers are present in the background as the president of the company stands behind some microphones. The Thompsons stand next to the president. A sign behind them asks, "Got Missing Kids?"
President
And so it is with great pride that we have flown little Billy Thompson out here, to be reunited with his parents for the first time in twenty years. [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Craig, Token, and Clyde show up and watch.] Mrs. Garthunk? [moves aside as she steps up]
Mrs. Garthunk
Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to be an employee of South Park Milk, [music plays] which to date has found over a hundred thousand missing kids, and, led the way in the fight against curdling. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, your son grew up not knowing who his parents were. [a shot of the Thompson couple] But he was strong and resilient, [a shot of the crowd] and ended up becoming very successful. I think it will amaze you as it will all of us to learn that your son... is Ben Affleck! [a picture is taken. The people in the crowd look puzzled]
President
Come around here, Ben! [a man makes his way through the crowd as the people clap and cheer. It's Ben Affleck]
Ben Affleck
Mom! Dad!
Steven
[opens his arms] Son!
Martha
[opens her arms] Oh, son! [Ben walks into their embrace as more pictures are taken]
Cartman
[walking up to the other boys] What's goin' on?
Stan
Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!
Steven
Oh, our same ol' Ben!
Martha
Oh, I'm so happy! [starts kissing him with her ass-face cheeks. Ben grimaces]
Mr. Garrison
Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now. [Mrs. Thompson is still crying and kissing Ben.]
Steven
Aw, son. [begins kissing him, and Ben grimaces again]
President
Isn't this wonderful?
Photographer
[gets into position] Okay gang, give me a big smile. [the Thompsons face the camera with Ben and the picture is taken. The crowd then disperses, and a man behind the boys is writing something on a note pad. He walks away as well.]
Kyle
Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
Cartman
Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck. [breaks into a grin and starts laughing] Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.
Stan
[noticing] Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.
Cartman
Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! [laughs some more.]
Kyle
Well wait a minute. Don't you see what happened?
Cartman
A-heh, what?
Kyle
Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
Stan
Huh?
Kyle
When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
Stan
Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
Cartman
E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
Kyle
There is no such thing as a funny fuse, Cartman. You felt bad.
Cartman
[silent sigh] Whatever. All I know is that I can laugh again. I'm gonna go home and eat another chocolate gun. Come on, Kenny! [Kenny follows Cartman, and they begin to cross the road. Kenny remains behind Cartman, and the sound of a motorcycle draws close]
Motorcycle Driver
[running over Kenny] Dangit! [Cartman spins to see Kenny's bloody body on the road... and roars with laughter]
Stan and Kyle face Cartman. Behind them the crowd consists of only the camera crew, Mrs. Garthunk, Ben Affleck and the Thompsons, and the workers
Stan
Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
Kyle
Our little man is growing up, Stan. He's growing up.
Stan
Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
Close-up of the Thompsons taking turns kissing Ben Affleck. Mrs. Thompson sobs and blows her nose
Steven
Aw son! [kisses him]
End of How to Eat with Your Butt


The Entity
Denver International Airport, day. Inside the terminal people are in long lines waiting to get their tickets or get on a plane. Mr. Garrison waits in line to have his bags scanned
Mr. Garrison
Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight! [sees a guard] E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too?
Security Guard
Uh I don't know nothin'.
Mr. Garrison
But you work for the- [the guard turns around and walks way] uh, God-damnit!!
Voice
[over the PA system] Snooty Airlines announces the arrival of flight 239 from Connecticut.
The Broflovskis stand in front of a perfume shop
Sheila
That's your cousin's flight, Kyle. Hold the sign up nice and high so he can find us.
Kyle
What's he look like?
Sheila
He's your age and about your height.
Kyle
I'm stoked my cousin is comin' to live with us. It'll be just like having a brother. [Ike flashes an angry look]
Ike
I todd a nurra.
Sheila
Oh, there he is. [waving] Over here, Kyle! [a boy wearing a NY cap and a #34 shirt appears. Kyle grins and holds up the sign. The boy looks to his right and walks off. Another boy appears, with bushy hair and a part down the middle and thick glasses]
Kyle Schwartz
Hello, Aunt Sheila.
Sheila
How was your flight? [Kyle lowers the sign and looks stunned]
Kyle Schwartz
Oh, it was terrible. They recycled the air on board and it really did a number on my asthma. I-I-e-I asked them to turn up the oxygen and they wouldn't. [walks up and joins the family]
Sheila
You remember Uncle Gerry.
Kyle Schwartz
Hi, Uncle Gerry.
Sheila
[kneels on one knee] And these are your cousins, Ike and Kyle.
Kyle
Hey dude.
Kyle Schwartz
It's nice to meet you.
Sheila
Let's get down to the baggage claim, Kyle. [rises and moves]
Both Kyles
Okay:
Sheila
[returns and genuflects again] Oooh, that's right! We've got two Kyles now. We'll just call you [to the nephew] Kyle, and you can be Kyle... [to the son] Two! [holds up two fingers and walks off. Kyle Schwartz (Kyle) follows her while Kyle Broflovski (Kyle Two) sorts this out]
Kyle Two
Cool. [follows the others out]
Ticket counter. Mr. Garrison's turn has come up and he approaches the counter
Clerk
[female] Next?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon. [hands her his ticket]
Clerk
[starts typing away] Mmmokay, the 2:30 flight to Cheyenne has boarded. Looks like you didn't make it.
Mr. Garrison
What? Well of course I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more!
Clerk
Nnnyeah, no problem, though. We'll get you on the 7 a.m. flight tomorrow morning.
Mr. Garrison
I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!
Clerk
[ignoring comments] Would you like a window or an aisle seat?
Mr. Garrison
This is unbelievable! You know, I seem to remember when the airlines said, "We need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-"!
Clerk
Mmokay, and have any of your personal items been out of your possession since you left?
Mr. Garrison
[people in the lines hear him and turn to look] Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers!
Man
Hey, he's right!
People
YEAH!
Clerk
Okay, and bags have been with you at all times?
Mr. Garrison
So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion-dollar salaries!
People
YEAH!
Clerk
[prints out a pass and hands it out for Garrison to get] And here's your boarding pass for tomorrow morning.
Mr. Garrison
You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business!
People
YEAH! ALRIGHT! GO!
Mr. Garrison
You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!! [turns and stretches his arms over the crowd] Come on, everybody!
People
YEAH!
Man
[next in line, approaches the clerk] Can I get on that 7:30 a.m. flight?
The Broflovski house, night. The family is seated around the dining room table as Sheila enters with soup in hand
Sheila
Here we go, Kyle Two. [Kyle Two smiles at the soup he's gotten] And here's yours, Kyle. [Kyle inspects it]
Kyle
[sniffs] Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?
Kyle Two
Mom's special stew. She makes it every Monday and I love it.
Kyle
Oh is, is this beef?
Kyle Two
Yeah, dude, it's great! [eats the soup with gusto]
Kyle
Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
Sheila
Oh, I'm so sorry, Kyle. What else can I fix you?
Kyle
Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
Sheila
Nonsense. Can't I make you some nice pasta? Or a frozen fish fillet?
Kyle
We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
Sheila
[rises and heads for the kitchen] I'll put it in the microwave right away. [heavy breathing is heard. Kyle Two looks at his cousin]
Kitchen, moments later. Sheila has gotten the fish and breaks it apart on the kitchen counter. Kyle Two appears at the doorway
Kyle Two
Mom?
Sheila
Yes, Kyle Two?
Kyle Two
How am I related to him again?
Sheila
He's your cousin, Kyle Two. I told you already.
Kyle Two
Yeah, but like... first cousin or distant cousin?
Sheila
He's my sister's son. That makes him your first cousin.
Kyle Two
So we have the same blood?
Sheila
Now Kyle Two, listen to me. Kyle is going through a very tough time in his life. His mother is very sick and he's in a whole new place. He's going to rely on you to make sure he fits in at your school.
Kyle Two
What? How the hell am I supposed to do that?
Sheila
I'm sure your friends will love him.
Kyle Two
What about Cartman, huh? He rips on me for being Jewish! He's gonna tear this kid apart!
Sheila
Kyle Two, he's your responsibility.
Kyle Two
Oh my God.
Sheila
I'm sure you two will become great friends with lots of late night pillow talk.
Kyle Two
Well what do you mean? [she catches her breath] What room is he sleeping in?
Kyle's room, past bed time. Both Kyles are in bed, the cousin getting used to the bed.
Kyle
What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
Kyle Two
I don't know, dude.
Kyle
Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
Kyle Two
I don't think so.
Kyle
Uh, can you take my stupid glasses and put them on the night stand. Make sure they're close by, because that fish upset my stomach and I might need them if I have to go to he bathroom later on.
Kyle Two
Okay. [reaches for the light and turns it off, then tries to sleep. That distinctive breathing returns as Kyle slowly goes to sleep, and Kyle Two takes a peek. Kyle swallows and turns his head to the left. Kyle Two looks at him, annoyed, then turns his back on Kyle and tries to sleep again]
Mr. Garrison's house, night. He's working at an artist's desk in his bedroom. On the wall are drawings of various types of aircraft, and on the floor around him are bits and pieces of all kinds of vehicles, including bicycle gears, airplane propellers, car motors, a muffler. To his right is a dresser with a small color TV on top. Mr. Hat is present on his right hand, as always
Mr. Garrison
Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!
Mr. Hat
What was wrong with that plan?
Mr. Garrison
It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit! [tries something new] Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle?
Mr. Hat
Boy, that Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass around.
Enrique Iglesias
[on TV, gyrating his hips around, holding his crotch in his left hand, the back of his head with the right one] ...I think about you day and night. I think about you...
Mr. Garrison
Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?
Mr. Hat
I said Enrique Iglesias can sure gyrate his hot ass!
Mr. Garrison
That's it. Gyration. [pulls something onto his desk] A gyroscope. [sets it in motion] It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius! [starts writing again] It's so simple and yet genius!
Mr. Hat
Check out his hot bulge, too.
Bus stop, next day. Kenny, Stan and Cartman wait at the stop. The two Kyles walk up to them
Stan
Hey dude.
Cartman
What's that thing?
Kyle Two
Cartman, I need to talk to you. [takes him off to one side]
Kyle
[to Stan] Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.
Kyle Two
Cartman, I'm gonna make you a deal.
Cartman
What?
Kyle Two
That kid over there is my cousin from the East Coast. He's having a really hard time right now, so I'm going to offer you forty dollars to not rip on him.
Cartman
Forty bucks?
Kyle Two
But you can't make fun of him AT ALL. No smartass comments, nothin'.
Cartman
Alright, alright.
Kyle Two
And you especially can't say anything about Jews!
Cartman
Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
Kyle Two
Cartman, no Jew jokes! All you have to do is keep your mouth shut, and you've got forty bucks! Can you do it? [Cartman looks past Kyle Two and sees Kyle talking away at the bus stop]
Kyle
I can't believe how cold it is out here.
Cartman
[pulls back and mulls his chances] Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
Kyle Two
Alright. [both return to the bus stop]
Kyle
It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
Kyle Two
[formal introductions] Kyle, this is Cartman, my sort of... friend-ish.
Kyle
[goes over to greet Cartman] Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
Cartman
[weakening] ...Oh, man.
Kyle
[observes this and gets angry] Cartman?!
Cartman
[snaps into action] Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. [at that moment, a large wheel zips by the bus stop, and the kids cover their eyes]
Stan
What the hell was that?
Neighborhood, day. Barbrady stops Craig's father in his car and is writing out a ticket when the large wheel zips by them.
Officer Barbrady
Uh what the hell was that?
Downtown South Park. People walk about doing stuff. The giant wheel zips by them as well, but few seem to notice
Stuart
What the hell was that?
Randy
I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it. [looks at Stuart] But I want one.
Stuart
Yep, me too.
Garrison's house, curb level. The giant wheel stops and two legs dismount. It's Mr. Garrison, beaming with pride and confidence
Mr. Garrison
We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone! [Mr. Hat doesn't move] Well what are you waiting for?!
South Park Elementary, day. Class is now in session.
Ms. Choksondik
And I know you'll all be very nice to our new student. [To Kyle] Kyle, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?
Kyle
Oh well, I I grew up in the shity, ah ah I really don't care for it. Ah I come from a Jewish family, which of course you already know, because Kyle's from the same family. [Kyle Two buries his face in his hands] I like to read, and I have these polyps on the backs of my hands - I don't know what they are.
Cartman
[resisting an urge] Ohmigod, I'm not gonna make it. I'm not gonna make it.
Kyle
...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
Cartman
[resisting mightily] I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
Ms. Choksondik
Okay, why don't you go ahead and take a seat, Kyle? [Kyle goes to the desks, looks around, then runs around]
Kyle
Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
Ms. Choksondik
Yes, unfortunately the school seems to be completely out of extra desks. So you'll just have to share with your cousin.
Kyle Two
What?
Kyle
Eh, oh, alright. [moves to Kyle Two's desk and squeezes in, and that breathing is heard again]
Ms. Choksondik
[turns to the blackboard] Now let's get on with our lesson on the-
Kyle
Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
Cartman
Ugh, ugh!
Ms. Choksondik
[faces the class] I'm sorry, Kyle. You'll just have to make do. [turns to the blackboard again] Now let's get back to the le-
Kyle
Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
Ms. Choksondik
[faces the class] Now Kyle, I need you to be quiet. In my class you need to be able to concentrate.
Cartman
Oh!
Ms. Choksondik
Concentration is the key to succeeding in my class.
Cartman
Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
Kyle Two
CARTMAN!
News 4 Newsbreak. An anchor soon appears with a window of Mr. Garrison beside him
Anchor
Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money. Mr. Garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device, which he simply calls "IT". ["IT" appears in the window] So what exactly is "IT"? ["IT?" appears in the window] Here with a report is a Hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel. [a window with that reporter pops up and soon fills the screen. Behind him is the Garrison house, and a small crowd is standing outside]
Hispanic Reporter
Thanks, Tom, I-oh... [looks at his lapel and brushes some of the stain off] Thanks, Tom. So far, Herbert Garrison hasn't let anyone get a look at his invention. He claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause one's eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it. But earlier today HBC News got footage of some of the country's top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look, including: Steve Forbes [seen exiting a black limo], Steve Jobs [seen exiting a white limo], Ted Turner [seen exiting a helicopter], Donald Trump [seen exiting a private jet], Bill Gates [seen leaving his own ship, the U.S.S. Bill Gates XP], and Yasmine Bleeth [seen exiting a small dingy car and wiping her nose]. Their curiosity is piqued, Tom, and so is ours. What is "IT"? What does "IT"do? And when will IT be somewhere where I can buy one? Reporting live, Jeff Arrando [trills the Rs], HBC News.
Playground, day. Kids are on swings, hobby elephants, slides, etc, as the camera pans across. At the end of the pan, Kyle and Kyle Two face each other in a clearing
Kyle Two
You need to learn to play some sports, Kyle. So we're gonna start with a tough one called, "Catch the Ball." I throw the football to you; you throw it back to me.
Kyle
Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
Kyle Two
It's fine!
Kyle
Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?
Kyle Two
Ih it's a football, dude. You just- put your arms out and catch it. [Kyle's arms spread out] Alright, here we go. [throws the ball, and it lands in the snow in front of Kyle, who just looks at it]
Kyle
Now what?
Kyle Two
Now throw it back to me.
Kyle
But it's down in the snow.
Kyle Two
...So dig it out.
Kyle
But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
Kyle Two
...Well, then we'll dry them off!
Kyle
Alright, then. [walks to the ball and digs it out]
Kyle Two
[turns away] Oh my God.
Cartman
[offscreen] Kyle, Kyle! [arrives] I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
Kyle Two
[Angrily] Yeah! They WERE, Cartman!
Cartman
Oh, and see, I didn't realize that. But I understand now how you might've felt what I said in the classroom was a racial slut. But see, I had no idea.
Kyle Two
You did, too! You are so full of crap!
Cartman
No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, "Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?" And I was all like, "No way!" And this little light went on in my head like, "Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin." But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan. [Kyle Two gets even angrier] What a misunderstanding, huh? [tries to be chummy with Kyle. Kyle brushes him off]
Kyle Two
You blew the deal, Cartman!
Cartman
Goddamnit, give me another chance!
Kyle Two
[his cousin walks up behind him with the football] Nuh-uh, I knew you were gonna make fun of my lame cousin, so I paid you the forty bucks NOT to rip on him! You ripped on him, deal's off!
Kyle
Uh you did what? [Kyle Two blanches]
Kyle Two
[puts his mittens up to his cheeks] Oh no.
Cartman
Haha, [slaps him on the back] serves you right, asshole. [leaves]
Kyle
You, you paid your friends tuh... [hangs his head] not make fun of me?
Kyle Two
Look, ih it's not because anything's wrong with you.
Kyle
Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
Kyle Two
Kyle, I-eh I'm sorry.
Kyle
Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
Kyle Two
What?
Kyle
Well, I mean, you didn't just start at 40, didja? You you gotta low-ball these things so you have a place to go.
Kyle Two
Uh-uh-uh oh, dude. Uh [shuffles away]
Kyle
Boy it sure is dry out here.
Mr. Garrison's house, backyard. The invited guest sit in two rows of chairs
Mr. Garrison
Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!
Mr. Hat
That sounds incredible, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible [the back gate open and Kyle walks in] is IT's patented gyroscope design. [he backs up and unveils the vehicle] Gentlemen, I give you, IT!
Guests
Whoa.
Steve Forbes
Nice.
Donald Trump
Sweet.
Mr. Garrison
IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.
Guests
Whoa. Wow.
Bill Gates
This will change everything.
Steve Jobs
We're going to have to rethink cities!
Mr. Garrison
[puts on a helmet] Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering. [operates each one as he describes it] The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. [gets into the wheel and activates the flexigrip. It extends into his anus and he groans as it locks him in.]
Guests
Ugh. Oh.
Mr. Garrison
...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such. [begins to suck on the flexigrip, then stops] Put the four together and we're ready to go. [gets the four flexigrips to work in unison and the vehicles takes off, first one way...]
Steve Jobs
Oh my God! [...and then the other. The guests turn to see IT zoom across the yard]
Steve Forbes
Look at it go! [Garrison crashes through the fence and disappears in the distance. Kyle, standing next to the new hole in the fence, isn't hurt]
Bill Gates
But the way it works... do you think people will go through that to travel?
Steve Forbes
Hey, it... still beats what you go through at the airports.
Guest 1
True.
Guest 2
Yup.
Guest 3
Yeah, that's true.
Guest 4
Yeap.
The Broflovski house, night. Two lights are on
Kyle Two's room. Stan is writing in a book as Kyle speaks
Kyle Two
I can't take it anymore, Stan. My cousin's been here for two weeks and he's driving me insane.
Stan
I know, dude. Every kid in school wants to kick his ass.
Kyle Two
I spent five years in this town making a good name for Jews and this... this... stereotype shows up and wrecks it all! You know what my biggest fear is? That I'll become him. That somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me, and I'll become a stereotype. I mean, I'm a Jew and he's making me hate Jews.
Stan
Dude, a self-hating Jew? You are becoming a stereotype.
Kyle Two
Ya see?
Kyle
[opens the door] I'm ba-ack!
Kyle Two
[slaps his head] Ugh.
Stan
Book. Later, dude. [leaves the desk, walks to the door and around Kyle, and exits. Kyle Two gets out his own writing book and starts writing. Kyle's breathing can be heard, and Kyle Two stops. Kyle eats a bit of cracker and Kyle Two resumes writing. After a while he grimaces, then buries his face in his arms]
South Park, day. The day for IT's unveiling is here, and it's being offered at Better Buy. Another camera focuses on the Hispanic reporter
Jeff Arrando
Tom, the day is finally here. IT has arrived for retail sale, and people are getting their first look at it.
Mr. Garrison:
[showing Craig's father how it works] Okay, good. Just step through here [the man does so] And then this is your steering and here's your throttle.
Craig's father
Okay. [starts working the flexigrips]
Mr. Garrison
Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch.
Craig's father
[feeling it] HAAAOW!
Mr. Garrison
It's alright, it's just locking you in. [some more groans from the man] You can take it. [looks up to see another rider] Doing great, Kathy. How's that ride? [she mumbles something, gives a thumbs-up, and continues driving. Garrison goes back to Craig's father] Okay, now use your mouth to operate the turn signals, and you're off. [the man gets all four flexigrips going, and he begins to roll down the street. Two men bring out a new one] Great! Who else wants to give it a spin? [an elderly woman steps forth grinning]
In front of Better Buy. IT drivers move about as Randy and Stuart look on. Craig's father rolls to a stop next to them
Randy
Oh, man, it that the IT?
Craig's Father
Hehyeah.
Stuart
How is it?
Craig's Father
Well, ugh. Ih ih it beats dealing with the airline companies, that's for sure. [rolls on]
Neighborhood, day. The boys have Kyle on a sled, which is tied to...
Kyle
I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
Kyle Two
Look, Kyle. Sledding is something all kids out here do. You've gotta learn.
Kyle
It seems like I might get splinters, though.
Kyle Two
[moves to the front of the sled to face his cousin] Remember: Just hold on. No matter how long the sledding run lasts, hold on.
Kyle
Hold on. I see. [...a bus. It revs up and leaves, headed for Connecticut. The rope between the bus and sled tightens, and the sled takes off] Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
Kyle Two
[calls out] Hang on!
Kyle
I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! [the bus goes around a corner and is gone]
Kyle Two
How far do you think it is to Connecticut?
Kyle
It's a least a couple of hours.
Kyle Two
Think he'll be alright?
Cartman
[leaving] He's faaahn.
Commercial
Announcer
[shot of a plane in the air, then of a full cabin] Are you tired of corporate airline companies treating you like a worthless sardine? [angry faces crowded into each other] Tired of ridiculous lines and horrible security at airports? [angry, vocal crowds yelling at security guards who seem to be taking their time. Next: shot of the plane in midflight again] Well, now there is an alternative to airline travel. [Next shot, an IT zooming down the road. The camera now moves along with IT] IT. [the driver leans to the left a bit to see where he's going] IT has taken the country by storm. [A J-mart is shown, and several ITs are parked out in the lot] And already two million have been sold. [An IT driver is shown going down the street. Another IT driver passes him] Never have another important business trip ruined by airline incompetence. [two elderly women ride to the edge of a canyon] Hey ladies! How did you get to the Grand Canyon? [they answer, but their voices carry and blur in the canyon. Next shot: a woman exits her house with her baby] IT comes in sizes for the entire family.
Woman
[putting the baby, Robby, into his own small IT.] Here you go, Robby. [Robby cries]
John Travolta
[in a studio stage, Stage C, somewhere, gets off his chair] Hello, I'm John Travolta. I used to rely on airlines to get me to set, but once I got used to IT, [walks over to IT and gets in] I found it to be a little less painful than dealing with the airline companies. I just power up the flexigrips. [groans in pain as the anal flexigrip takes hold] And I'm ready to go. Thank you, IT. [revs up and takes off.]
Announcer
[a shot of ITs entering and leaving a parking lot] So join the millions of Americans who have felt a little more comfortable with... traveling. [the oral flexigrip squirts something in a driver's eye. The IT logo appears] Order yours today and remember our slogan: IT's better than flying.
Kyle's house, living room. Kyle Two has finished watching the commercial
Kyle Two
...Hm, that was pretty gay. [starts humming, and Sheila enters the room]
Sheila
Kyle Two, where is Kyle?
Kyle Two
[poised] I don't know, Mom. Last time I saw him he was sledding.
Sheila
Where on earth could he be? [starts to leave]
Kyle Two
You know, it's just possible he went back to Connecticut.
Sheila
[quickly returns] What?
Kyle Two
Well, ah I mean, maybe he got so worried about his mom that found a way to get back and see her.
Sheila
Don't be ridiculous, Kyle Two. He's out playing with his new friends.
Kyle Two
I'm just throwin' it out there as a possibility. [the doorbell rings and he goes to answer the door]
Kyle
[at the door] I'm ba-ack.
Kyle Two
AAA!
Kyle
[enters] I'm sorry. You must've been worried sick. I got your sled tangled up with a bus. [looks at Kyle Two]
Kyle Two
A, a bus. R-really?
Sheila
[rushes up] Kyle, what happened to you??
Kyle
Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas. [gives Kyle Two the remains of the sled] I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
Kyle Two
Oh no- don't worry about it, dude.
Sheila
Oh you poor thing! Come upstairs and we'll get you out of those wet clothes. [leads him away. Kyle Two looks dismayed] Are you alright?
Kyle
Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
IT dealership, day. The IT has grown so popular it's left Better Buy for its own sale space. The camera pans across the showroom floor to Mr. Garrison, seated in front of an IT Motors Inc. sign. He's got a stack of bills to his right and a computer to his left, all on a futuristic desk
Mr. Garrison
We're in the money, Mr. Hat, We're in the money, Mr. Hat... [Jimbo, holding his lower back, walks up to Mr. Garrison] Oh hi, Jimbo. Can I help you?
Jimbo
Yeah, I wanted to order that theft alarm for my IT.
Mr. Garrison
[reaches under his desk and pulls out a form] Oh, right, right. Take a seat.
Jimbo
Uh, that's okay, I'll stand.
Mr. Garrison
[Randy walks up to the desk] What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?
Randy
Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
Mr. Garrison
Sure.
Randy
Well, [walks back to IT] it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.
Mr. Garrison
Yeup.
Randy
[returns to the desk] Well... so... they don't really... do anything.
Mr. Garrison
Right.
Randy
So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
Mr. Garrison
[thinks about this a moment] Well, I... guess you could. [a view of the showroom]
Man 1
Huh?
Man 2
Whazzat?
Man 3
Wha- what did you- what did he say?
Man 4
What?
Denver International Airport, day. A plane takes off. Inside the terminal the boys and Kyle stand around
Kyle
I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
Kyle Two
Kyle, we told you: Kids in Colorado all play hide and seek at the airport.
Stan
Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
Kyle Two
[leans towards Stan and in a low voice] Ungh, this is taking too long. The flight to Connecticut is about to leave. [looks at the guard] Ey! Can we speed things up here??
Security Guard
Daaah, sorry, but ever since that IT thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees.
Kyle Two
Dude, we're the only ones here! How long does it take five people through security?!
Security Guard
Derr, let's see: Twelve people... plus... times... divided... two hours domestic, three hours international.
Kyle
Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
Kyle Two
No!
Security Guard
[to Kenny] Dah ha! What's this?! A toenail clipper! [rises to his feet and aims a gun at Kenny] Die, terrorist! [kills him with one shot]
Kyle
Oh, Jesus!! [the corpse starts to bleed]
Security Guard
See, we do these checks for a reason!
Kyle Two
This is ridiculous! Come on! [leaves. The others except Kyle follow. Cartman stops and pulls Kyle away. The boys head through some doors designated for employees only, with security bypass]
Tarmac, outside. The boys stop at a plane ready to take off
Kyle Two
Okay, Cartman, you're it. Start counting. [Kyle Two pulls Kyle away, Stan follows]
Cartman
[turns toward the landing gear and buried his face in a wheel, then starts counting] 1, 2, 3, 4...
Kyle Two
[Stan and Kyle Two stop at a box] Here, Kyle. You go hide in here. [shows him the box]
Kyle
In there? But it's very confined. I'll get cramps in my legs.
Kyle Two
JUST GET IN THE BOX!
Kyle
Uh, alright then. [goes in. Stan and Kyle Two quickly seal the box with wrapping tape and carry it off] Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle. [the two boys toss the box into a luggage cart, an employee tosses the box onto the conveyor, and it falls into the cargo bay with the other luggage] Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- [the plane taxis to the runway and is ready to take off]
Kyle Two
I hope he doesn't suffocate.
Cartman
[leaving] He's faaahn.
Stan
Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. [he and Kyle watch the plane lift off]
Kyle
Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast! [as the plane climbs, the side of it is shown: Air Antarctica] Oh, I did it again!!
IT dealership, day. Crowds mill around the dealership. Federal agents raid the building and start hauling ITs away. Mr. Garrison isn't pleased
Mr. Garrison
Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?
Agent 1
It's alright, we're with the government.
Agent 2
We're just shutting you down.
Mr. Garrison
Shutting me down? Why?
Agent 3
[the first two agents exit with an IT] The airlines are in desperate trouble. Your vehicle is causing them to lose money.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!
Agent 4
Right, so the government is bailing the airlines out again, by shutting you down and making ITs illegal.
Mr. Garrison
OH, GOD-DAMNIT! You'd better be kidding! [pounds the desk]
Agent 5
Sir, many people work for the airlines. We can't let them all be fired.
Mr. Garrison
THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!!
Agent 6
That may be true. But if you build, sell, or ride another IT, "it" will be the last time. Have a nice night. [the agent and his partner walk off with the last IT and Garrison is left with a barren showroom]
Mr. Garrison
HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! [the agents, in their black cars and big rigs, leave]
The Broflovski house, night. In the living room, Sheila paces the floor as Kyle sits on the sofa
Sheila
Oh, it's been days! Where can he be?
Kyle Two
I dunno, Mom. It's like he vanished into thin air.
Sheila
I'm gong to call the police again. Kyle Two, go down to the playground and look there.
Kyle Two
[gets off the sofa] I already checked the playground, Ma. [reaches the front door and opens it] I told you, he isn't really- [turns in astonishment to see Kyle back at the front door]
Kyle
I'm back.
Kyle Two
GAAAH! [hangs his head in dismay]
Sheila
[offscreen] Kyle! [Kyle enters] You're back!
Kyle
Yeah, it was the craziest thing. I hid myself on a plane to Antarctica. Oh, it was so dry down there.
The Broflovski house, a few days later. Stan and Cartman approach the door. Inside, Kyle is standing in the living room, his arms crossed. He's clearly pissed off. The door opens, and Stan and Cartman walk in.
Stan
So dude, did Cartman's idea work?
Kyle Two
No. I tried getting my cousin lost in the woods, but a stupid bear brought him home.
Stan
Damn!
Kyle Two
I just have to face facts that I'm goin' to live with my crappy cousin forever.
Kyle
[approaching with Sheila, carrying suitcases, ready to go home] Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.
Kyle Two
[the boys are stunned] ...What?
Kyle
Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.
Sheila
Now that things have changed for Kyle, his mother needs him back.
Kyle Two
[gasps in relief and turns to Kyle] Do you promise?? [steps back] I mean, oh. Thah-uh that's too bad, dude. What, what changed for you?
Kyle
Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. [heads for the door with Sheila]
Kyle Two
Okay. See ya, cousin. Hope to see ya soon. [once Kyle is out of earshot, says in a low voice] Not too soon, I hope.
Stan
Yeah, haha.
Cartman
Heheheheheh. [the door is heard opening and they realize what Kyle just told them]
All Three
Five million dollars??? [they quickly rush up to Kyle and block him from leaving the house. Sheila is already outside]
Kyle Two
Dudedudedude! You- you have five million dollars??
Kyle
Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
Kyle Two
[holds his palms out] Wait. Kyle, this may sound crazy, but I think you should stay!
Stan, Cartman
Yeah!
Kyle
Re- really?
Kyle Two
Yeah. You see, I've learned something today. [Sheila watches from outside, waiting for Kyle. Music starts up] Sometimes people have trouble fitting in at, at school and,... [music dies] and um... Let's see, what did I learn about? [voice fading, strokes his chin] What did I learn about today?
Cartman
[steps forth] I- I, I learned that... you shouldn't judge somebody because... that-no, wait.
Kyle Two
Nonono, it was good! What were you going to say?
Kyle
Listen, guys, I appreciate you wanting me around, but, the fact of the matter is, well, yeh, you guys are just kind of douche bags.
Kyle Two
... Uhwhat?
Kyle
I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog. [picks up his suitcases and goes towards the door] Ah I can't take it. See ya. [walks out and joins his aunt to the car. The boys are left stunned, having been judged and found wanting once again]
Kyle Two
Dude! Weak.
Cartman
[turns to Kyle] ...Good job, Jew!
End of The Entity


Here Comes the Neighborhood
South Park Elementary, day. Butters stands in front of the class witha small volcano - his science experiment.
Butters
...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and... [throws his head back, closes his eyes, and chants] O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh- [the belching volcano draws his attention as it coughs up the "lava"] Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
Ms. Choksondik
Okay, good job, Butters. You get a check.
Butters
Ah, thank you, Ms. Choksondik! [wheels his experiment back to his desk] I got a check. That's like a C!
Ms. Choksondik
Okay. Whose project should we look at next? How aboouuut Eric? [tape is heard leaving its spool] Eric Cartman?
Cartman
[wrapping something together] Stand by, please.
Ms. Choksondik
NOW Eric!
Cartman
[leaving his seat] Oh, god dammit!
Kyle
Haha!
Cartman
Shutup, Jew! [moves to the clearing, turns around, and faces the class. He clears his throat] Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
Ms. Choksondik
You just put that thing together just now! I'm giving you a check minus.
Cartman
Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
Ms. Choksondik
Siddown. [Cartman walks towards his desk]
Cartman
I'll make you eat your parents!
Ms. Choksondik
What did you say?!
Cartman
Nothing! [takes his seat]
Ms. Choksondik
Alright, Token, you're next. [Token leaves his seat carrying a laptop computer, then turns towards the class]
Token
Using my laptop computer, I hooked into the Internet and found a meteorology Web site. [pops open the case and displays the page] I donwloaded the data, and with my dad's video projector, I can show you the graph I made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months. [pulls the projector over and plugs it into the laptop, then runs the graph. The resulting projection shows cloud formations moving across the U.S. Ms. Choksondik is impressed]
Clyde
Wwooww.
Token
[turns around and shows some sheets to the class] I also printed out the results on my color printer. Here you are, Ms. Choksondik. [hands her the papers]
Ms. Choksondik
Very very good, Token. You get a check plus.
Token
Alright! [goes back to his seat with his laptop]
Cartman
Aw, that is such bullcrap!
Ms. Choksondik
[sigh] Eric, for the love of God. [drops her head down to her desk]
Cartman
No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
Token
My family isn't rich.
Cartman
Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
Stan
Your family is rich, dude.
Token
But I...
Cartman
[leaves his seat and walks over to Token] Let's just see where Token's clothes come from, shall we? [tugs at his sweater] Ooooo, Armani Exchange!
Kyle
Aharmani Exchange?
Cartman
All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?! [Token opens his mouth to say something, but shuts it up instead] I didn't think so! [moves back to his seat.]
Stan
Yeah, dude, your family is so rich they have their own pool table.
Butters
Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? [zoom in on Token's face as he realizes they may be right]
Token's house, after school. His parents are at the sofa. His father reads a newspaper; his mother, a book. Token walks in
Linda
[notices and lowers her book] Hello Token. How was school today?
Token
Mom? Dad? Why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in South Park? [both parents blink and lower their reading materials]
Bob
Well, because we have more money, son.
Token
I know. But why?
Bob
...W-well, because we went to graduate school and therefore have more lucrative jobs than most people in town. For instance, your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company, whereas your friend Eric Cartman's mother is a crack whore. One pays more than the other.
Linda
Why, sweetie? What's the matter?
Token
All the kids at school made fun of me today because I'm rich.
Bob
...Oh.
Token
I don't wanna be rich anymore! I wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and, and wear clothes from J mart!
Linda
[voice quivering] J mart?
Bob
[comforts Linda] Son, you, you don't know what you're saying.
Token
I just wanna be like all the other kids in South Park. Please, Mom and Dad, please. [his parents blink and look at each other]
J mart, later. A small SUV pulls into the J mart lot. Token takes his first look at J mart. He is awed by it and pleased at the chance to shop there.
Bob
You... sure you want to do this, son?
Token
I'm sure. [the SUV stops and Token hops out. His parents follow, but just stand by the car]
Linda
Hmmm...
Bob
Where's the... valet?
Linda
He must be parkiing someone else's car.
Bob
Ah, here we go. [moves to his right as a man approaches and stops the man] Take good care of it, please. [puts the keys in the man's hands] Here's twenty dollars. [the man just stands there. The family walks into J mart through the center doors] Hoh? [shields his eyes from the lights] They've activated some kind of alien blinding device.
Token
That's not a blinding device, Dad. It's fluorescent lighting.
Bob
[relaxing] Oh.
Linda
[calling out] Excuse me, where can where would we find young men's fashion apparel? [an obese blonde woman appears]
Obese Woman
Aisle 6, next to the pretzels.
Bob
[eyes widen] Next to the-?!
Token
Come on! [runs forth. His parents follow, his father shielding his eyes. Token stops at a clothes rack and pulls out a pair of pants] Hey look: there pants are only five bucks apiece. They must really suck. What do ya think?
Linda
What, what brand are they?
Token
It doesn't matter, Mom. They're poor people pants.
Randy
[nearby with Sharon, who is checking out toilet paper] Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?
Sharon
[puts the paper in the shopping cart] Huh? [looks to see] Oh. Yeah, it is. [they see Token look at more pants] What are they doing here? They can afford to shop at Cherry Creek. [nearby two shopping carts clash]
Liane
Do you see that, Sheila? The Williamses are shopping here.
Sheila
I don't get it. He must pull in at least two hundred thousand a year. [others stop and stare as Token brings out another pair of pants for comparison. More people stop and stare, and a long silence follows]
Bob
S-son, can you just hurry it up? I don't think we quite fit n here.
Stan's house, afternoon. In the living room, six boys are gathered on the floor around a board game: Clockwise: Craig, Tweek, Clyde, Cartman, Stan, Kyle
Cartman
Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
Token
[enters the room] Hey you guys. [has a DVD under his arm]
Stan
Oh hey, dude. Did you bring the movie?
Token
I sure did.
Cartman
Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
Token
Yeah, well, you know, I did a little shopping at J mart.
Stan
[gets up and walks over to Token] Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. [stops next to Token]
Token
Here you go. [hands him a DVD disk]
Stan
[looks at the disk] What's that?
Token
It's a DVD of the Lion King
Stan
DVD? We don't own a DVD player.
Kyle
Yeah, dude. [rises and joins Stan and Token] Nobody does. They're too expensive.
Cartman
Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. [the others laugh and gether around Token]
Craig
Don't you have a VHS of it?
Token
I only have this.
Cartman
[takes the DVD and holds it up] Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. [the others laugh]
Token
What's a VHS?
Cartman
Oh, Jesus, dude. [Lowers the disk and laughs with the others]
Stan
Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. [heads for the door]
Kyle
[jokingly] What's a VHS? [laughs and the others laugh as they head for the door. Cartman tosses the DVD to Token, but it just falls to the floor.]
Token looks at the DVD, then at the boys, then at the DVD. He lets the DVD case fall to the floor on top of the DVD and leaves the house. Music comes up as he leaves the Marsh house
Token
Why can't I be like all the other kids?
[sees Kenny and brother Kevin playing on their lawn. Kenny is flying around getting dizzy while Kevin plays with a deflated basketball.]
They all have three-bedroom homes, broken trucks on their lawns.
[hops onto a wooden box and peeks in - he sees Butters eating]
And cut-up hot dogs for lunch
It's not my fault my parents succeed so much.
[leaves the window and walks over to Stark's Pond, then sits and pulls out a dollar coin from a small collection. The pond has thawed, and lily pods can be seen on the water. Token tosses the coin, and it skips across the water. He then walks on and stops across the street from the South Park Welfare Office. Craig and his family leave the office with their welfare check as Cartman and mom walk in.]
There's no one in town I can relate to.
I play with autographed baseball bats
[he fades into a baseball uniform and holds a bat with Barry Bonds' signature on it]
while everyone else just plays with sticks and pine cones
[across the street he sees a baseball game, with Kyle pitching, Cartman catching, Stan at bat, Clyde in left field, and three other boys. Sticks and cones are being used. Stan hits the cone. It sails away and Stan rounds the bases]
Has a boy ever felt so alone?
[drops his bat and glove and walks away, then stops and gets a look of determination.]
Well, who needs them anyway? I won't pretend to be something I'm not
[rushes home and goes to his desk to work on something - a 2-page tabloid ad extolling South Park as the next Aspen]
If I can't be poor, I've got to deal with what I've got.
If I can't be like them, what I need is more rich kids around,
So I'm not the only one, and then I won't be so... down.
[he finishes, puts the ad into a sturdy envelope addressed to Forbes Magazine Department with some bills, and goes to the window to look at the sunset. Outside, the camera pulls back from the window]
Please, God, send more rich kids...
To my...
Town
[As the camera pulls back, Token's house is shown to be big indeed, with a three- or four-car garage set back some distance from the street. To the right, two more houses appear, but they are small next to the Williams house.]

Next shot, a mansion in the Hollywood Hills. The camera pulls back to show Will Smith reading Forbes Magazine
Will Smith
Ooo, look at this, honey. [his wife Jada walks up] A beautiful unspoiled town in the Rockies. This is just what we've been looking for!
Jada Pinkett Smith
"Like Aspen was 30 years ago." Sounds nice.
Will Smith
We could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing! And then I could finally live like a cowboy.
Jada Pinkett Smith
Oh Will, the country would be such a nicer place to raise our kids!
Will Smith
O kids? [they show up]
Older Boy
Yes, Daddy?
Will Smith
How would you like to move to the Colorado Rockies?
Older Boy
The mountains, Daddy?
Girl
Can we have horses?
Older Boy
O can we? Can we Daddy?
Will Smith
You bet!
Kids
Hooray!
South Park, soon after, day. A new four-story mansion rises in a new lot. A crane positions the new fountain in a circular driveway in front of the mansion. Token grins as he watches the laborers work. A limosine and a moving truck pull up behind him. Will Smith and family pour out of the limo
Will Smith
Well, here it is. Our home to be.
Jada Pinkett Smith
Oh, Will, it's beautiful.
Token
[turns to greet them] Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood!
Will Smith
Why thank you, young man. We're the Smiths.
Older Boy
Ah, a local boy. You shall be our new playmate. I'm Frederick. This is my sister Lisa, and my brother Daniel [the younger boy grins and waves]
Token
I'm Token.
Lisa
Our daddy is a very famous actor. What does your daddy do?
Token
Aah, he's a lawyer. I think.
Will Smith
How quaint. Kids, why don't you play with little Token while your mother and I check out the town.
Frederick
Very well. Come, local boy. [the kids move off] Show us how to play your mountain games.
Token
All right! [rushes to catch up to them, but returns and stops] Thanks, God. [runs to catch up with the others]
Token's mansion, later. Token leads the Smith kids on a tour of the mansion
Token
...And this is the room where my mom and dad keep their original v-Van Gogh painting.
Frederick
Yes, yes, we have one of those, too. In fact, we have seven of them, I believe.
Token
[with relief] You do? God, that's great!
Daniel
Why?
Token
I'm just so happy you guys moved into town. You see, I used to be the only rich kid. All the other families here are kinda [motions a low palm] low to [raises his arm to shoulder level] middle-income.
Lisa
Why? What happened to all their money?
Token
Well, they never really had any money.
Lisa
Well, then, why don't their daddies just act in a movie?
Token
Well I... think that.. they...
Frederick
Sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies.
Lisa
Indeed.
Frederick
Like when Daddy doesn't want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad.
Lisa
So we must plead with him: [falls on her knees] "Please, Daddy, please! It's twenty million dollard, Daddy."
Daniel
[falls on his knees] "Please, Daddy, please!"
Frederick
[falls on his knees] "Twenty million is still twelve million after taxes, Daddy!"
Lisa
"I want a llama, Daddy!"
Frederick
"I'd do the picture, Daddy!"
Lisa
"Please, Daddy!"
Frederick
"Daddy, please!"
Lisa
"Daddy, do the movie, Daddy!"
Daniel
"But Daddy!" [all three rise]
Frederick
And so Daddy does the picture.
Token
...That's ...great.
Lisa
Twenty million dollars great.
A recording studio. A rapper is laying down some tracks.
Snoop Dogg
I found a girl who had an innie and I felt her with my jimmy
Player-haters try to do me 'cause my rhymes are just tooo-
Engineer
Sorry, Snoop Dogg, but Will Smith is on line three for you?
Snoop Dogg
Oh. [removes his headphones and answers the telephone] William! How are you buddy?
Will Smith
[back in South Park on a public phone] Great, Snoop Dogg, and you?
Snoop Dogg
Couldn't be better. I'm just laying down some vocals for my new album.
Will Smith
[chuckle] Great, Snoop-Snoop. Listen: Remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses?
Snoop Dogg
Oho yes, the kids bug me about it all the time.
Will Smith
Well I found the place, Snooty-roo. It's in the Rockies, but totally undiscovered, laid-back, and beautiful.
Snoop Dogg
Ogh. It sounds lovely!
Will Smith
You really should come give it a look. Jada and I would love for some friends to move here with us.
Snoop Dogg
I certainly will, William. And perhaps I'll give ol' Maigc and Kobe Bryant a call. They've been looking for vacation properties as well.
Will Smith
Great! Well, let me let you get back to your recording.
Snoop Dogg
Hah, see you soon. Bye. [hangs up and puts on his headphones]
Will Smith
Bye. [hangs up]
Snoop Dogg
Alright, let's take it from the top, gang. [the rhythm starts up again and plays for a few seconds...]
I shout "Hell Yeah!" from my vehicle. Livin' is a miracle-
South Park, day. Another rich family moves into town. Jimbo, Ned, and Mr. Garrison watch from across the street.
Mr. Garrison
Look, there's more of them moving into our town. [other men join these three. Among them are Randy, Gerald, Stuart, and Skeeter] You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main.
Jimbo
Yep, there goes the neighborhood. [a shot of the new family headed for the house]
Mr. Garrison
That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.
Gerald
Hey! W-what are you saying? What "types"?
Mr. Garrison
[pointing] Yiou know, those types! Rich people! [shot of movers and family members moving furniture into the new home]
Jimbo
Oh. I don't take kindly to rich folk. Neither does Ned.
Ned
Nnnope.
Jimbo
I remember back in the day, RICH folk weren't alLOWED in South Park! Now thery're movin' here in droves!
Skeeter
They're gonna be sending their kids to our schools, and mixin' them with our pure, non-rich kids!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, yeah, and it won't be long before they drove all of us poor underachieving people out of town with inflated real-estate costs!
Skeeter
Damn, I hate those stupid richers!
Mr. Garrison
Yeah. [calls out] Hey, rich guy! [a man holding a box of dishes is laughing at something his partner said, but both men look at Mr. Garrison, and the grin vanishes] Hey, Richie Rich! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, richer! What's in the huge box, richer?! Your checkbook? [the men laugh]
Jimbo
Yeah. How many rich people does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! They can hire people to do it for them! [the men laugh again]
Mr. Garrison
Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers! [the men laugh. The two black men just look at this crowd] Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house! [laughs. The two men across the street look at each other, confused, and go into the house with the boxes they pulled from the truck]
Jimbo
I guess we showed them!
Another house, nearby. A crane is positioning a swimming pool. Oprah Winfrey directs the workers from the edge of the lawn
Oprah Winfrey
A little to the left. That's great and- Let's put another pool over there. [a kid stands across the street, behind Oprah] Uh huh, good. [close-up in the kid - it's Token. Frederick approaches him from screen left]
Frederick
Token, these are Oprah's newly-adopted children, Dominique and Zizi.
Dominique and Zizi
Hello. [Lisa and Daniel join Frederick so that Dominique and Zizi are behind them]
Token
Hi.
A Boy
[enters screen right] Cheerio!
Frederick
Ah, and these are Puff Daddy's kids: P Diddy Mini, P Poofy Bite-size, and Poppa Diddy Diddy Puff Fun-size.
Token
Wow, my plan to get rich people here sure did work. Hey, I got a great idea! Let's all pack some lunches and go sledding.
Lisa
Oh no, we're going shopping.
The Kids
[exulting] Shopping!
Frederick
Yes, come Token. We're all going to head down to the mall and buy some of the stores. [the group begins to move screen left as Token stands there]
Token
Oh. Alright then. [turns right and joins the group]
The local bar, night. It's pretty busy, with people chatting away and enjoying their beer. Some motion is seen outside the doors, and soon they open. Three rich men enter and scan the bar, then move to a nearby table and sit. One of them is Kobe Bryant
Kobe Bryant
'Scuse me, can ew get a couple of beers here? [the jukebox stops and all the bar patrons look at the new guests.]
Skeeter
They've got nice expensive beers for you across the street at the new Wolfgang Puck's.
Kobe Bryant
That's alright, we just want some cheap beer tonight. [the men at the bar glare at the three men]
Barkeep
...Maybe you didn't see the sign out front: This bar is for people livin' below their means ONLY!
Men
Yeah!
Kobe Bryant
This is a free country. I can have a drink wherever I want.
Man 1
[stands up and urges] Come on, Kobe, let's just go.
Kobe Bryant
[]This ain't over! This ain't over by a long shot! [leads his two friends out of the bar]
Mr. Garrison
[turns to the bar with the others next to him] Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here!
Ned
Nn-what do you mean?
Mr. Garrison
How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase "t"!
Jimbo
Lowercase "t"?
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, for "time to leave"!
Bar Patrons
Yeah!
Mr. Garrison
Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase "t"! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!
Mr. Garrison
Alright!
Kobe's mansion, night. Through a bay window he's seen reading his newspaper in an armchair near a fireplace. A FOOM is heard and a flicker of light is reflected on the walls outside Kobe's house. He notices, takes a hard look, rises from his chair and goes to the front door. He opens it, annoyed, but his expression changes to one of fright. He sees the lowercase "t" burning on the lawn
Kobe Bryant
Tee. T- Time to- leave?
Mr. Garrison
[from some bushes across the street] T is for "time to leave," cashchucker!
Kobe Bryant
I'm callin' the police. [moves inside to make the call]
Skeeter
I think we scared 'im.
Jimbo
Yeah. Next house we'll do a capital T, to show 'em we REALLY mean business!
Men
Yeah!
South Park, new polo grounds, day. A group of rich kids gather to begin a polo game. They all ride on ponies.
Frederick
Now Token, polo is very simple. You simply must hit the williard into some cilium with your fracaman.
Token
Well, yeah, but can't we just play without these uncomfortable uniforms? [the other players laugh]
Frederick
[playfully jabs Token] "Can't we play without the uniforms?" Yes, um. Lert's eat caviar without Bellini's as well! [the others laugh] Now come, Token, and remember: it doesn't matter who wins. It matters who wins three times in a row. Tally ho!
Players
Tally ho!
Player 1
Oh!
Player 2
Yay!
Player 3
This is exciting.
Player 4
Oh, Frederick, this is wonderful!
Cartman
What in the hell are they doing?
Kyle
Is that fun?
Stan
I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
Cartman
Well, let's just play our game, then.
Kyle
Alright.
Cartman
Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! [goes over and kicks Kenny in the nuts - Roshambo has begin!]
Kenny
(Ow!)
Kyle
I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! [goes and does so. Kenny kicks Cartman in the nuts. Cartman returns the favor]
Stan
I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! [leaves Kyle and kicks Cartman in the nuts. When he turns around Kenny kicks him in the nuts.]
Cartman
Kick his nutsack! [kicks Kyle in the nuts. Stan kicks Kenny in the nuts. Token rides up and stops to watch the boys while the game continues. Soon, a player and horse ram into his and knocks him and his horse away - It's Frederick.]
Frederick
You see, you must pay attention, Token. I was able to jollyrow your davishmere with a forecastle.
Token
[rises and dusts himself off as his horse leaves] This game is too confusing. How about we have a snowball fight?
Player
A snowball fight?
Lisa
How barbaric.
Frederick
Yes, Token, if you want to play such savage games, I suggest you go live with lions. [the other players laugh at him as we turns wand walks away from them.]
Token
I don't fit in anywhere.
South Park, another part of town. Bill Cosby and his two kids
Bill Cosby
Passenger 1
Hey! What are you doing? If you're going to ride the bus in South Park, you're gonna have to sit in the FRONT!
Passengers
Yeah
Passenger 2
Yeah, that's where the first-class seating is! [points to the front. The Cosbys rise and head for the front, where four seats are empty. His daughter takes a seat to his left, across the aisle, his son takes a window seat, and he takes the aisle seat next to his son.]
Passenger 1
Yeah. How do you like that, richer?!
Bill Cosby
Well it's very nice, actually
Passenger 1
Yeah, I'll bet it is!
Bill Cosby
Very, very comfy.
Passenger 1
Uh huh, looks like it.
A field, a while later. Token stands there talking to someone
Token
Hello, my name is Token. I don't fit in with all the kids at South Park Elementary so, I invited a bunch of rich kids to move to town. The problem is, I don't fit in with them, either. That's why I've come to live with you. [the camera pulls back to reveal the field is actually a lion's lair. A sign outside the lair says AFRICANUS LIONUS CARNIVORUS. A waterfall gurgles nearby and lions laze about] So if you'll have me and raise me as one of your own, I promise to be the best lion I could be. [two lions growl at him] Uuuh, yeah.
Chef's house, day. Chef is seen shoveling snow off his driveway
Chef
Shovel that snow, babih, it's all nice, heavy and wet. Just- [he hears voices and spins around. A group of rich folk are marching in protest]
Millionaire Protesters
We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
Oprah Winfrey
You there, come march with us!
Chef
For what?
Oprah Winfrey
All the poor people in town think they can persecute and harass us decent rich folk.
Will Smith
So we're uniting and marching on the town square!
Kobe Bryant
[raises his fist a la Black Power] The Million Millionaire March!
Millionaire Protesters
Yeah!
Oprah Winfrey
Come on, brother! [the protesters resume the march]
Chef
But... I'm not rich.
Will Smith
[stops and looks at Chef] What? [the others stop]
Chef
I'm just a school cafeteria chef. Ahah I don't make much money.
Will Smith
We'll give you a hundred dollars.
Chef
Woo, fudge the snow now. [tosses the shovel away and joins the march]
Millionaire Protesters
We shall perservere. We shall perservere.
Chef
[with the others] I shall perservere. We shall perservere.
The lions' lair at the zoo, later. Token takes a raw steak and bites into it, growling
Token
RRrrr!! [rips a piece of steak off with his teeth and chews on it]
Milly Larsen
[rushes up to the lair cage] Look at the little black lion, Mommy. [her mother passes by with her little sister in a stroller]
Mrs. Larsen
He's cute, isn't he? [the girl rejoins her mom and walks away. Two lions growl at each other and stand up, then leap down off their rock and stand next to Token. He move his steak out of their reach]
Token
Roar! [the lions step back and look at each other]
Lion 1
What are you doing here, boy?
Token
You- you talked. I, I understood you. I must be becoming a lion!
Lion 2
You're not becoming a lion. The only way you can do that is to see Aslan.
Token
Who's Aslan?
Lion 1
Very well, walk this way. [they walk off, and Token gets on all fours to follow them. They go through a low entrance into a white cave in the middle of which sits a great lion - Aslan]
Aslan
[regal voice] Is this the boy who's been living in our realm?
Lion 2
Yes. [two other lions come in and watch]
Token
Are... you... Aslan?
Aslan
M-I am.
Token
[rises] Well, I'm Token
Aslan
So, you want to live with the lions, do you?
Token
Yes. Um. Great Aslan. I don't fit in anywhere else.
Aslan
And what makes you think you can fit it with us?
Token
Well, I don't know.
Aslan
Do you like jokes?
Token
What?
Aslan
Jokes! You know, funny, hahaaa. Us lions love jokes.
Token
...I like jokes a lot.
Aslan
Mmm. Then there may be hoipe in you yet, young apprentice lion. Very well. We wihill let you stay, if... you can pull this thorn from my paw. [holds up his left paw. Token looks at it, and Aslan moves it closer to him] Go on, try it. Pull my thorn! Come on! Pull my thorm! [Token approaches it and pulls the thron out. Aslan farts and the two escort lions snicker softly] Ho ho ho ho ho ho! Ho ho! [the other lions burst out laughing]
Token
So can I stay?
Aslan
He-you may. But being a lion may be harder than you think.
The local bar, later. The bar patrons watch a TV as a report is heard. Seen are Mr. Garrison, Randy, Stuart, Skeeter, Gerald, Jimbo, and Ned.
Reporter
[not seen yet] A billion billionaires are gathering their ranks and will be marchng on the town square tonight [now seen on TV] in South Park to petition the end of separate bars, bus seating and restaurants. It looks like it will be a great turnout, as some of the millionaires also paid several thousand Mexicans to march for them. [a marcher carrying a rake and shover hears this and turns around]
Skeeter
If they get that petition passed, it's all over.
Jimbo
I guess we learned our lesson: you can't fight rich folk; they're just too powerful.
Mr. Garrison
Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?
Skeeter
They won, Garrison. They can't be scared out of town.
Mr. Garrison
No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything? [the other men think about this for a second]
Jimbo
...Ghosts?
Mr. Garrison
Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!
Men
Yeah!
Mr. Garrison
Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!
Men
Alright! Yeah! Let's Go! Right!
The zoo, lion's lair, night. The lions have eaten and lay about on the boulders. One by one, they belch and the others laugh. Token sets his bowl down...
Token
Huuuunh [...and walks over to Aslan] Aslan.
Aslan
Yes? What is it, young lion apprentice?
Token
...I thnk I'm gonna go home now.
Aslan
Home. But I thought your friends made fun of you at home.
Token
They do. But, I guess I learned something today. You see, even though kids at South Park make fun of me, I still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or, lions. Even though I may be different from them, I still like my old friends best.
Aslan
It sounds like you learned much, young lion apprentice. Very well. But before you go, perhaps you would like... a stick of gum?
Token
[recalling that lions love jokes] ...No thanks.
Aslan
Go on. It's spearmint!
Token
No, because there's a spring in there, and if I pull the gum out, it's gonna hurt my finger.
Aslan
Oh. So you don't want any gum then? Are you... sure? Go on, try it!
Token
[pulls the stick out of the pack, and a small spring-loaded bar hits his thumb] Ow. [half-heartedly]
Aslan
[leads the other lions in a bout of hysterics] That is good stuhuff! [continues laughing with the other lions]
Token
[under his breath, as he leaves the lair] Jesus, lions suck!
South Park town square, night, in front of the Mayor's office. The billionaires are present, and Will Smith is at the podium
Will Smith
And so it is with great determination that us decent rich Americans have gathered to say: "We will be separated no more!"
Millionaires
Hooray!
Mayor McDaniels
This certainly has been an enlightening evening. And as Mayor, I accept your petition and will abolish all separation laws.
Millionaires
Yeah!
Mayor McDaniels
And I want to assure the nation that is watching that South Park is not a town of prejudice or bigotry.
Voices
Woooooo!! ["ghosts" appear from behind the various town buildings and rush towards the millioaire crowd. They surround the crowd, still makign ghost noises. The millionaires are startled]
Oprah Winfrey
What the-?
Mayor McDaniels
[shuts her eyes] God no. [Will Smith moves around not knowing what to do. A "ghost" spooks him]
Will Smith
AAAaaahhh! [the "ghosts" begin to disperse the millionaires]
Millionaire 1
Carl, do you see what I see?
Carl
Yes, Martin. I do believe this town is hainted. [two "ghosts" come up and startle Martin and Carl. Nearby, Will Smith's kids stand in a huddle, scared]
Will Smith
Kids! Go find the limo and get in! [the kids hurry off.]
Snoop Dogg
[walks up to Smith] You didn't tell me this town was hainted!
Will Smith
I didn't know! [grabs Snoop and shakes him] I.. DIDN'T... KNOHOHOHOW... [both men turn and flee as several "ghosts" move in on them. The "ghosts" take their sheets off: it's Skeeter, Mr. Garrison, Gerald, and Randy]
Skeeter
It's working!
Gerald
They're scared to death!
A mansion, the same one Mr. Garrison and the men saw earlier as they commented on the new richers moving in, night. The family rushes towrads the front door
Millionaire
Pack up your things quickly! We've got to get out of here! [some "ghosts" pop out from the bushes and drive the family away with their haunting noises.]
The town, night. "Ghosts" continue to chase the millionaires around. In the background, Stan leads a group of boys down the street. With him are Kyle, Cartman, Butters, Pip, Tweek, Clyde, and Craig
Stan
Oh hey, there's Token. [Token approaches them from the opposite direction]
Token
Hey guys.
Stan
Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
Token
You mean, you want me around?
Stan
Sure, dude, you're our friend.
Token
Yeah, I know. But you guys always rip on me for bein' rich.
Stan
Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
Kyle
Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
Butters
They sure do.
Stan
Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
Kyle
Right.
Token
That's right, huh?
Kyle
And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
Stan
Yeah, I get it for that.
Kyle
And Cartman for being fat.
Cartman
Uh huh.
Kyle
And Cartman for being stupid.
Cartman
Yeah.
Kyle
And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
Cartman
Hey.
Kyle
And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole
Cartman
Ey, you did me already!
Token
You're right, guys. From now on, I'm fine with being made fun of for being rich.
Stan
Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
Token
You're not?
Kyle
No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
Stan
[walks past Token] Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.
Kyle
[walks past Token, behind Stan] Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
Cartman
[walks past Token, behind Kyle] Pussy. [Pip walks by without saying anything]
Butters
[walks past Token, behind Pip] Heh yeah, later, puss.
Craig
[walks past Token, behind Butters] Ha, that guy's a pussy. [drags a sled behnd him. On the sled is Kenny, dead and badly beat up, with his right eye hanging out of its socket. Tweek and Clyde bring up the rear, and Token looks as they leave him behind]
Token
[turns to face the other boys] Wait! I liked being ripped on for being rich better! [walks behind the other boys]
The rich enclave, later. The men of South Park have succeeded in chasing the rich folks out of town, and they gather in front of a mansion. They take off their sheets
Skeeter
That was it. We just saw the last of them speeding away in a van!
Men
Alright!
Gerald
They were so scared, I'm sure they'll never be back!
Mr. Garrison
That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!
Men
[confused] What?
Jimbo
But then you had us do all that for nothin'. Don't you see: If you get rich sellin' these homes, then there will still be rich people in South Park.
Randy
Yeah. You'd become what you hate.
Mr. Garrison
Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-
End of Here Comes the Neighborhood

Kenny Dies
Unplanned Parenthood, day. It has undergone renovation, so it looks softer. It's snowing outside
Inside, operating room. A woman is waiting on a hospital bed. She's quite pregnant. A doctor enters the room with a cart housing everything he needs for his work, and approaches the bed
Doctor
Alright, Ms. Sanders, all ready for your abortion? [picks up her chart and reads as canned laughter is heard]
Ms. Sanders
Ready as I'm ever going to be, I guess. [the laughter quiets down a bit, but still rolls]
Doctor
Well, try to relax; It will all be over very soon. [more laughter]
Ms. Sanders
Docter, can we turn off that television? [switch to a wide shot of the room, and the television is seen. On screen is a comedy skit featuring Benny Hill and an elderly man. That's where the laughter comes from]
Doctor
[looks up first] Oh yes, I 'm sorry.
[moves to turn off the set and a close-up of the skit is shown: Benny Hill, dressed as a constable, raps the old man on the head and then shoos him along. The set is turned off, and the doctor returns to the woman's bed.]
Now, there is one more thing.
Ms. Sanders
What?
Doctor
Have you heard of stem-cell research?
Ms. Sanders
Uh-I've heard of it on the news, but... I don't know what it is.
Doctor
Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases. Right now, a lot of stem cells come from the tissue of aborted fetuses- [taps the woman's leg] ah- I'm sorry, unwanted children. And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies.
Ms. Sanders
Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others.
Doctor
The hope is that someday it might. [hands her the release form and she signs it]
Ms. Sanders
Well okay. [hands the form back to him]
Doctor
Great. [puts the form inside the cart] Well, here we go. [puts on his gloves]
Hallway outside operating room. A vacuuming sound is heard for a few moments before a janitor passes by with a vacuum cleaner. The OR door opens and the doctor steps out with a small container
Doctor
Nurse? [a nurse arrives] This is to go to Alder's Labs for stem-cell research.
Nurse
Yes, Doctor.
The nurse takes the container and goes to the room next door. She types in a keypad combination and a song starts up: Willie Nelson's "On The Road Again." She pours the contents of the container into a bio-hazard bag and places the back into a secure box. Outside, an Alder's Research Group truck backs up to the loading dock on the outside of Planned Parenthood. Clinic personnel gather the boxes and place them inside the truck's trailer. Once the last box is in they close the trailer and the truck rolls away.
The highway, moments later. The truck rolls along to "On The Road Again." and the driver joins in the singing
Truck Driver
...going places that I've never been
Seeing things that I may never see a- Uuugh! [a deer leaps into the read ahead of him and looks at him] Jesus Christ!! [swerves to avoid the deer and goes over a cliff, tumbling down its side. It lands somewhere below with its contents spilled all over the place. The driver is killed on impact, but the song continues to play...]
The highway, moments later. A Big Wheel rounds a corner...
Cartman
[rides along] My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm. [sees the trashed truck and its contents] What do we have heah? [strokes his chin]
A cow pasture, later. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny sit among the cows burning cow dung. Kenny holds the match and lighter. The cows around them are grazing
Stan
Well that burned a long time.
Kyle
Yeah, that was pretty good. [a cow near them drops five pellets and walks off]
Stan
[all three rush to the new dung] Oh dude, there goes one.
Kyle
[to Kenny] 'K go! [Kenny strikes a match and lights the dung, which yields a nice fire]
Stan, Kyle
Alright!
Kenny
(That's awesome) [coughs heavily]
Kyle
You've had that cough a while, Kenny. You okay?
Kenny
(All right. I'm fine.)
Butters
[rushing up to them] Hehehey, fellas! Ah, hey fellas!
Stan
What, Butters?
Butters
Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
Stan
Tell him we're busy.
Butters
Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
Kyle
What, did he lose a hundred pounds? [the boys laugh]
Butters
Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew. [the boys stop laughing and look at him] Yeah.
Stan
Alright, let's go see what he wants. [the boys turn right and leave. Butters stays behind and looks at the melted turds. He approaches, squats, and sticks his finger in it]
Butters
Oh, it's all sticky. [wipes his finger off on his coat, leaving a streak of turd on it]
Cartman's house, minutes later. The three other boys approach him in the living room. Cartman can barely contain his glee.
Kyle
Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
Cartman
Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
Stan
What?
Cartman
Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
Kyle
A trampoline?
Cartman
Better.
Stan
A boat?
Cartman
Better.
Kenny
(A football machine?)
Cartman
Better.
Stan
Well WHAT, Cartman?
Cartman
Thirty-three aborted fetuses. [the boys look back at him for a long time] Oh yes.
Kyle
...What? [closes his eyes in disbelief]
Cartman
Mint condition, tax free.
Stan
Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
Kyle
I'm leaving right now! [turns and heads for the door]
Cartman
Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
Kyle
[turns around] You've never watched the news, fatass! [rejoins Stan and Kenny] And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
Cartman
Stem cells, numbnuts!
Stan
Stem cells?
Kyle
Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
Kenny
(What the fuck are stem cells?)
Kyle
They're cells that come from fetuses, and some research show that they could be used to treat diseases.
Cartman
[points at Kyle] It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
Kyle
...I hate you so much. [turns around and heads back for the door again. The others turn and follow. Kenny coughs again.]
Cartman
Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
Cartman's house, later. He's up in his room placing cold calls to business he finds in the Yellow Pages.
Cartman
Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.

[later]

Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy.


[later]

Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck.


[later]


I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake. [suddenly grins and covers the receiver with his right hand] That's a joke [removes his hand from the receiver] ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye. [hangs up and relaxes, putting his feet up on his desk and his hands behind his head] Damn I'm good.

Alder Research Group, some days later. Cartman enters, hauling the thirty-three aborted fetuses behind him in a wagon. Workers around the lab move stuff around
Receptionist
Can I help you?
Cartman
Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
Receptionist
Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.
Cartman
[rips out a bill...] Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
Researcher
[in the background, walking by] This is awful, just awful!
Receptionist
Oh Larry! This young man has some new fetuses for research.
Cartman
[picks up and carries a box] You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
Larry
[the researcher] Oh well, I'm sorry, but we can't buy those from you now.
Cartman
...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
Larry
I'm afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research.
Receptionist
A ban? Why?
Larry
Too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study. It's too bad, too. We really coulda helped a lot of people.
Cartman
[Cartman's mouth opens in disbelief, then he gets angry] Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! [throws the box down on the floor, breaking it and spilling its contents. Now there are thirty-two aborted fetuses]
South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are filling their seats. Stan and Kyle enter the classroom
Stan
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
Kyle
[he and Stan take their seats] Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.
Ms. Choksondik
[enters carrying a few books] Alright, class, let's take our seats. [sets the book down on her desk and turns to the class] Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office.
Stan
The principal? Aw, come on!
Kyle
We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
Ms. Choksondik
She needs to see you now! [points to the door. Stan and Kyle leave their seats, Kyle leading Stan]
Kyle
Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Stan and Kyle enter expecting the usual lecture, but are surprised to see their parents on either side of Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey
Principal Victoria
Hello, boys.
Stan
Wait. What's going on here? [he and Kyle back up a bit. Their parents join them]
Kyle
Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
Mr. Mackey
[Chef has joined the principal and Mr. Mackey] You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat. [the boys each take a chair and sit down] Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay. [the boys look stunned] And well, he's pretty sick. [Sharon leans on Randy]
Kyle
Kenny's sick?
Stan
Well how sick?
Chef
Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.
Stan
[after a pause] ...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
Sharon
Oh dear. [buries her face in Randy's shoulder]
Stan
Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
Sharon
Randy...
Randy
They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
Kyle
Wait. Kenny's going to die?
Gerald
...He might, Kyle.
Stan
[tearing up] ...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.
Mr. Mackey
We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.
Stan
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! [buries his face in Randy's arm and begins sobbing]
Cartman's hosue, day. He's upstairs in his room placing cold calls anew.
Receptionist
Can I help you?
Cartman
Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
Receptionist
Oh, right, the fetuses. We were very lucky you called. Our last shipment of fetuses was lost in a truck accident.
Cartman
[rips out a bill...] Gee, that's terrible. So, uh who do I talk to about payment?
Researcher
[in the background, walking by] This is awful, just awful!

South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are filling their seats. Stan and Kyle enter the classroom
Stan
Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
Kyle
[he and Stan take their seats] Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.
Ms. Choksondik
[enters carrying a few books] Alright, class, let's take our seats. [sets the book down on her desk and turns to the class] Now, uh, before we get started, Stan and Kyle? Uh, the principal needs to see you in her office.
Stan
The principal? Aw, come on!
Kyle
We don't know where Cartman is, Ms. Choksondik!
Ms. Choksondik
She needs to see you now! [points to the door. Stan and Kyle leave their seats, Kyle leading Stan]
Kyle
Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
Principal Victoria's office, moments later. Stan and Kyle enter expecting the usual lecture, but are surprised to see their parents on either side of Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey
Principal Victoria
Hello, boys.
Stan
Wait. What's going on here? [he and Kyle back up a bit. Their parents join them]
Kyle
Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
Mr. Mackey
[Chef has joined the principal and Mr. Mackey] You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat. [the boys each take a chair and sit down] Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay. [the boys look stunned] And well, he's pretty sick. [Sharon leans on Randy]
Kyle
Kenny's sick?
Stan
Well how sick?
Chef
Children, Kenny has been diagnosed with a... terminal disease.
Stan
[after a pause] ...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
Sharon
Oh dear. [buries her face in Randy's shoulder]
Stan
Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
Sharon
Randy...
Randy
They don't think so, Stanley. Your... your friend is terminally ill, and that means.. Well son,... th- that means he's going to be going to heaven soon.
Kyle
Wait. Kenny's going to die?
Gerald
...He might, Kyle.
Stan
[tearing up] ...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.
Mr. Mackey
We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.
Stan
No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! [buries his face in Randy's arm and begins sobbing]
Cartman's hosue, day. He's upstairs in his room placing cold calls anew.
Cartman
Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.:[later. There are now thirty-one]
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. [hangs up and sighs deeply]

Liane
[opens the door and looks in] Sweetie, your friends are downstairs. They need to see you.
Cartman
Not now, Mom, I've only unloaded three feti; I've gotta sell the rest before they spoil.
Liane
They say it's an emergency.
Cartman
[shifts in his chair] Buh, alright. [Liane leaves] eh, Butters?
Butters
[steps into view in Cartman's room] Uh, yeah?
Cartman
Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
Butters
Eh, just about.
Cartman
[leaving his chair and heading for his door] Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
Butters
Oh. Well, uh okay. [approached Cartman's chair and hops on]
Cartman
[turns around] Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
Butters
Right. [picks up the phone and checks out the next number. Cartman leaves. Butters starts dialing] Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
Living room, moments later. Cartman reaches the foot of the stairs.
Cartman
What is this, a PTA meeting? [before him stand his mother, Sheila, Kyle, and Stan. Stan's head hangs forward as he looks down]
Kyle
Cartman. [pause] Kenny's in the hospital.
Cartman
[shock and distress flashes across his face] In the ...hospital? Why?
Kyle
They told us he has a m-muscular disease. An and, that ...and that he, he might die. [Stan raises his head and looks at Kyle]
Cartman
[more worried] Die? Kenny?
Stan
[looks up at Kyle] Don't you say that! Kenny's not gonna die!
Sheila
I'm going to go take the boys to go see him at the hospital, Eric. We thought you might wanna come.
Cartman
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. [turns and goes up the stairs]
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Kenny lies in a bed in a patient room with an IV unit attached
Doctor
[fixing an IV for Kenny] There we go, little buddy.
Kenny
(Thank you, Doc.)
Doctor
You sure you don't wanna take your jacket off; it's pretty warm.
Kenny
(I'm all right)
Nurse
Hey, look who has some visitors. [walks in with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman]
Doctor
Hmm, what a lucky little man. We'll be right outside if you need us, Kenny. [the nurse and doctor leave the room.]
Kyle
[volunteers] Hey dude, how's it going?
Kenny
(I'm okay, I guess.)
Cartman
We got you a present: it's a Gobo fighter.
Kyle
Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
Cartman
Heh, sorry. [Stan remains speechless. Kenny looks at his friends and coughs violently]
Kyle
Hey, uh- we were all just talkin' about how when you get better, we're all gonna go down to Stark's Pond again and go camping. Huh, Stan?
Stan
[finds his voice] I- [looks at Kenny, then at Kyle, then at Kenny, and rushes out the door]
Hell's Pass Hospital, day, outside. Stan rushes out the front door, Kyle pursuing
Kyle
[looks around] Stan? [sees him and follows] Stan, where are you going?
Stan
I can't, I just can't.
Kyle
Dude, he needs us right now.
Stan
[turns around] I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
Kyle
I, I know it's tough but- [Stan turns away] Look at me! [turns him back around] I know it's tough, okay?! I know! But we have to be tough right now!
Stan
And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
Kyle
Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
Stan
[turns around and walks away] Just leave me alone!
Kyle
Stan, you can't leave!
Stan
[turns once more, with tears in his eyes] I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! [turns and leaves. Kyle turns to go back to the hospital, but sighs silently]
Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Kenny's room. Cartman was left alone with Kenny as Kyle went after Stan
Cartman
[with emotion in his voice] ...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.
Kenny
(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)
Nurse
[opens the door and looks in] Okay, we're gonna need to get Kenny some time to sleep now.
Cartman
Don't you worry, Kenny. I I'm gonna find a cure for you. Everything's gonna be okay! [walks towards the door. The nurse leaves, then Cartman exits]
Hospital corridor, Hell's Pass Hospital. Cartman appears outside the door with a long face, chokes up, and faces the wall to cry
Kyle
[returning to Kenny's room] Cartman?
Cartman
[composes himself] Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? [sniffles]
Kyle
Cartman, were you... crying?
Cartman
' No! No, I mean, I, I got somethin' in my eyes. It's this uh, the air in here is just- uh. [breaks down again, but tries to hide it] Oh man.
Kyle
Hey Cartman. [Cartman looks up and turns around] I care a lot about him, too. [Cartman wells up again, and Kyle reaches out to hug him]
Cartman
I'm gonna find a cure, Kyle. I swear to God I'm gonna find a cure.
Kyle
[comforting him] Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.
Alder Research Group, next day. Inside, employees are packing away their computers and other office equipment
Larry
[enters with Cartman] This is where the bulk of our research was being done. But due to the government ban, we're mostly just packing things up.
Cartman
Doctor, can you tell me exactly how stem cells work?
Larry
Look, you have trillions of cells in your body: heart cells, skin cells, brain cells, and so on. But before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell, it's what we call a stem cell. Sort of like a blank cell. Do you understand?
Cartman
Not at all, but go on. [they both turn and approach a table. On the table is a cage with a rat inside it.]
Larry
Because these cells are blanks, they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them. You see this rat? Earlier this year, we surgically removed the middle of her spine. then we injected her with some stem cells and... they became the missing part of the spine.
Cartman
My God...
Larry
Nerve cells damaged by Parkinson's disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells.
Cartman
So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.
Larry
That's the theory.
Cartman
Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!
Larry
Well, no. To build another Shake's it would be better to use lumber.
Cartman
Hmmm.
Larry
But, unfortunately, the government has banned stem cell research and so... we'll never know.
Cartman
Looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the government's mind. [turns around and heads for the exit]
Larry
Where are you going?
Cartman
There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.
Larry
Hey kid. [music stops, then a pause] Give 'em hell. Give 'em hell. [strikes his fists together, one over the other. Cartman returns the gesture with a thumbs-up, then walks off... then stops]
Cartman
Oh, doctor. [Larry turns around. Cartman has his thumb up] Thanks. Thanks. [Larry returns the gesture with his own thumb up, and Cartman leaves again.]
Larry
Oh, hey kid. [Cartman returns] Good luck. Good luck. [Cartman gives a thumb up, walks away, then backs up]
Cartman
Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. [walks away]
Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Kenny's room. The McCormicks, Kyle, and Chef are present. Kyle has with him a bunch of get-well cards from the other students in his class. The bed is seen from an angle
Kyle
...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, "We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny." And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! [shows him the picture: Butters and Kenny are in a little yellow biplane]
Chef
Oh, isn't that nice? You've got lots of friends, don't you Kenny?
Kenny
(Yes.) [coughs a bit] (But what about Stan?)
Kyle
Stan? Oh. Well, no, there's nothing here from Stan, but, well, Stan's gonna come and see you real soon, I bet, Kenny.
Kenny
(I hope so)
Nurse
[opens the door] Hey, look who's here.
Kenny
[perks up a bit] (Stan??)
Woman
[walks in with balloons and an assistant] Hello, Kenny, I'm Laura Jones, and this is Bob Ferrin.
Bob
We're with the Make-A-Wish Foundation. [a cameraman walks in and moves to the head of Kenny's bed]
Ms. McCormick
Oh, Kenny, isn't that nice?
Kenny
(The Make-A-Wish Foundation?)
Laura
We travel the country given special little boys and girls like you their biggest wish.
Kyle
Neat, huh Kenny?
Kenny
(Yes.)
Laura
So Kenny, if you could have ONE wish, what would it be? [there's no answer. A moment of silence]
Bob
What's your wish, pal?
Kenny
(I guess the only thing I wish is to not die.)
Laura
What did he say?
Kyle
He said his wish is not to die. [a long stretch of silence in which the cameraman looks from person to person.]
Laura
...O-kay, and, what if you're gonna have two wishes, what would the second one be?
Bob
I know! I bet you wanna meet Madonna, huh?
Kenny
(No. Fuckin' Madonna...) [his words trail off and are hard to understand]
Bob
Wu- what was that?
Kyle
He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. [the Foundation reps are stunned. Madonna appears in the doorway]
Madonna
Should I come in now?
Bob
Uh no not quite yet.
The cow pasture, day. Stan has come here to reflect on Kenny's hospitalization. He sits on a log resting his head on his hands and watches as a cow drops a load of dung next to the log. He strikes a match and tosses it on the dung. The dung lights up and burns
Chef
[approaches] Hello there, children.
Stan
Hey Chef.
Chef
How's it goin'?
Stan
Bad.
Chef
Yeah. Things have been better.
Stan
Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
Chef
[sighs] Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He's all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can't get over it, so he doesn't care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don't matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.
Stan
But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
Chef
Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin' to cry about. That's like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it's our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. [pause]
Stan
I think I understand.
Capitol Hill, Washington DC
Cartman
My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds. [a shot of Congress] I love Kenny McCormick and... [sob] I want you to love him too. [cries as Congresspeople look to each other] And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song [takes a deep breath]

It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant

The heat of the moment shone in your eyes

I never meant to be so bad to you

One thing I said that I would never do

Congressman 1
One look from you and I would fall from grace.

Congressman 2
'And that would wipe the smile right from my face.

Congressman 1, Cartman
Do you remember when we used to dance? [three Congressmen perform the following: two leg slaps and a clap]

A few Congressmen
And incidents arose from circumstance? [more Congressmen perform the moves]

Everyone
One thing led to another; we were young [everyone does the moves, and the result is thunderous]

And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment

Telling me what our hearts meant

The heat of the moment

shone in your eyes

Planned Parenthood, day. Cartman, in shirt and tie, is outside with clipboard in hand, talking to a woman about to have an abortion.
Cartman
And so you see, now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted, we can sell your fetus to companies like Alder Labs.
Woman
Oh, I don't know.
Cartman
Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
Jill
Seventy-five dollars? Well, alright.
Cartman
[hands the clipboard over for her to sign the release form] Great, just sign right here, please. [another woman arrives] Hi. Havin' an abortion today? [Jill hands him the clipboard back, then heads for the clinic] Great. [to the second woman] Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there. [she nods and reaches for the clipboard.] And you sign right here. [hands her the clipboard and she signs. A couple passes by] Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? [the second woman enters the clinic]
Woman 2
We're not going to the abortion clinic. I'm going to have this baby.
Cartman
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.
Man
Oh. Well, I guess we can always... just make another one.
Woman 2
Oh Mark, I love you.
Cartman
Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Stan enters with a package, his faith renewed, his confidence strong, and makes his way down the hall, passing people as he goes
Head nurse
[at her station] Young man, do you know where you're going?
Stan
Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
Head nurse
All right! [Stan passes a man in a wheelchair]
Man In Wheelchair
Go kid! [Stan passes a man on crutches]
Man On Crutches
Good for you! [Stan passes a doctor and nurse, and they smile]
Hell's Pass Hospital, Kenny's room. Stan enters happily
Stan
Hey, Kenny! [grins, then is stunned. The room is empty. Kenny is gone. Due to terminal illness.] Oh no. [Kyle walks up to the room, but stays outside] No.
Kyle
He just... He just... stopped breathing. And it was over.
Stan
But... [a shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye. [another shot of the bed reveals a teddy bear on the floor] Did he say anything before he went?
Kyle
He just said... "Where's Stan?"
First Church of South Park,some days later, day.
Mr. Garrison
And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.
Stan
I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. [the doors fly open and Cartman walks in. He sees his friends and they look back.]
Cartman
You guys! Come quick! [Stan and Kyle look surprised]
Kyle
What, Cartman?
Cartman
It's... [Cartman turns around] Why, it's a miracle, you guys! [rushes out the door to a spot on the side of the road. Stan and Kyle follow.]
Outside, day. Cartman stops, but still bounces from joy. Stan and Kyle join him
Stan
What, Cartman? What's happened?
Cartman
Look. [across the street stands a Shakey's Pizza] I put the stem cells from all the fetuses I had next to a Shakey's, and they ARE replicating a new Shakey's! [oozing sounds are heard as a new Shakey's is indeed rising up next to the current one] It worked! [Kyle is shocked.]
Stan
This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
Cartman
Stupid fetuses? It's my own Shakey's!
Kyle
I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
Cartman
I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies, [Kyle turns and faces him angrily] and I can finish up the kitchen.
Kyle
AAARGH! [jumps up on Cartman and starts pummeling him. Cartman tosses him off]
Cartman
Aah! Kyle! [Kyle punches him across the face a few times] Kyle! [Kyle delivers a series of punches to the chest]
Stan
Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend! [Kyle gives Cartman a good roundhouse right and Cartman falls on the ground, face first.] Cartman was! [Kyle continues beating Cartman up]
End of Kenny Dies

Butters' Very Own Episode
Butters' home, night. Butters enters the living room with a gift in hand. He walks up to his parents. His mom is polishing an end table while his father reads the newspaper on the sofa beside it.
Butters
Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
Chris
Oh, is it someone's anniversary soon? [chuckles]
Linda
[puts her hands on her hips] Oh, you!
Chris
Just kidding. [lowers the newspaper and takes the gift from Butters and shakes it] Oh, I wonder what it is.
Butters
It's a- [covers his mouth for a second, then looks down] Awww, shucks, [looks at his dad] I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
Chris
Well, looks like we're gonna have to do somethin' extra-special for Mommy and Daddy's anniversary this year. How about on Saturday we all go have dinner at Bennigan's!
Butters
Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it?? [starts running around the coffee table in excitement] Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! [stops and bounces with excitement]
Linda
Calm down there, cowboy. You've still got four days.
Butters
Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
A montage of Butter's previous appearances in South Park fills the screen. Then the picture of Butters with a Barbie doll grows to fill the screen. Then as this chorus is song, the following scenes appear: Butters at Picture Day - a lock of hair pops straight up as his picture is taken. He tries out for Fingerbang. He turns around and is about to show his "fruit bowl." He puts on a condom. He's with Token and Timmy at the drugstore. He says a few lines in the "Helen Keller! The Musical" play.

Everyone knows it's Butters!

Butters
[In the splash screen, claps his fists together in the hole] That's me.

[Butters, with pic of himself and John Elway, corrects the choir: "Elway!"]
Who's that tyke with the cutest little dimples,
Battin' his eyes at every puppy he sees?
If you look inside yourself, you might be surprised when you find
A little boy named Butters!

Butters
[In the splash screen, the hole he was in is gone] That's me, [brings his fists together twice.] Yeah. [walks off to his left].
Return to Butters' living room. His mom is dusting off a portrait on the wall as his dad returns to reading the newspaper
Butters
[making calculations on a sheet of paper at the coffee table] Three more days till we eat at Bennigan's. That's s-seventy-two hours. Aw gee whiz.
Chris
[rises and walks over to Mom] Well, if you two will excuse me, I need to go and buy a certain special lady her anniversary present. [hugs her gently]Linda: I hope he means me, haha. [Dad turns and walks to the door.]Butters: Don't be silly, Mom. Of course he means you.
Chris
[at the front door] I'll be back in a little bit. [Butters rises to see him off] Butters, you're in charge of the house.
Butters
[salutes] Yes sir! [Dad exits and closes the door. Butters moves back to the table.]
Linda
[walking towards the door] Oh, I wonder what he's gonna get me this year?
Butters
We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
Linda
[walks around Butters to the other end of the coffee table] Every year it's the same. Your father gets me some great gift and my gift to him falls short. [walks away towards the camera and stops, wondering] I've just got to outdo him this year, I've just got to.
Butters
Dad's a good shopper all right.
Linda
[kneels beside Butters] Butters, maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what he's getting me.
Butters
You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
Linda
[rises and goes to the computer] No, it's a little different. You remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector? [takes a badge from the desk and shows it to Butters.]
Butters
Sure I do!
Linda
Why, I think Inspector Butters could find out what Daddy'd getting Mommy without him ever knowing. [hands the badge to Butters, who puts it on] What do you say?
Butters
[salutes her] Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! [walks away]
"The Butters Show" splash screen, but now only "Butters" is on the screen.
Choir
Everyone know it's Butters!

Butters
[pops out through an exploding hole and points to himself with his thumb] Uh, that's me!
South Park, night, the seedy side of town. Butter's father walks down the street and stops at a corner. He sees a pawn shop across the street and walks towards it. He turns and looks around the street, then puts on a hat and turns up the collar on his shirt. He walks back the way he came. Butters has arrived and sees him from behind a bush across the street. Butters has on his own disguise - a handlebar mustache - and carries a note pad, on which he takes notes of his father's every move. He pops out from behind the bush. His father looks around to make sure no one is following and arrives at Studcat Theater to see "Fisting Firemen 9." He looks around as he enters, and the doors close behind him
Butters
[takes down the info he sees] Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
Butters' father soon leaves the theater and walks towards a men's bath house, the White Swallow Spa. He arrives and rings the doorbell. He looks around both ways and enters as soon as the buzzer sounds. Butters looks on from behind a trash can across the street
Butters
[writes down] "White Swallow Bath House"

Butters' house, night. He's returned from his tour of espionage and finds his mother in the kitchen cutting carrots into slices
Butters
I'm back, Ma!
Linda
Oh, hi sweetie. Did you get to follow your dad around?
Butters
I sure did. [walks over to the breakfast table and takes a seat] Dad sure had a nice night out.
Linda
Well, did you see what he got me for our anniversary?
Butters
Well first, he went to see a movie.
Linda
A movie? Hmmm. I wonder why he'd wanna see a movie by himself.
Butters
I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat. [Mom freezes] I didn't know it was open. [a look of dread is on her face]
Linda
Wait a minute. What was the movie called?
Butters
"Fisting Firemen 9" [her dread turns to shock] I've never seen 1 through 8.
Linda
Oh my God...
Butters
Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
Linda
Butters, where did Daddy go after the movie?
Butters
To the gym.
Linda
To the gym?
Butters
Yeah. The White Swallow Spa.
Linda
[stung by that revelation] Gaah!
Butters
Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
Linda
[really shocked] ...Butters? Are you sure about this? You have to be absolutely sure!
Butters
Inspector Butters gets all the facts. I even got some neato pictures. [holds them up for his mom to see. She walks over and takes them from him. She sees her husband gong into the theater, then into the spa, then being rammed by a man from behind...] The only thing I can't figure out is why dad told you he was goin' shoppin' for your present when he was goin' out to see the movies an' wrestlin'. [his mom faints right to the floor] Oh, did you have a nice "trip," Mom? See you next "fall." Hahaha, yo- Ma?

Butters' house, day. He's working with Lego blocks at the coffee table while his mom works on the wall behind him, painting over one shade of green with a lighter shade. Her hair is a mess.
Linda
[in a fractured, disturbed voice] Paaiint. Must paaiint. Everything clean. Paaiint.
Chris
Well, honey, you've painted the entire house. Three times.
Linda
Must paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new!
Chris
[approaches Butters] Say Butters, m-I'm havin' real trouble finding an anniversary present for Mom. Any ideas?
Butters
Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
Chris
Well then, it looks like I'm gonna have to go out shopping again. [walks towards the front door.]
Linda
[paints furiously now] Ungh. Paaiint. Everything clean. Everything new. Paaiint.
Chris
[opens the door] I'll be back in a little while. [exits]
Butters
[walks over to the door] Should I go see what he gets you again, Mom?
Linda
I don't think Daddy's shopping. I think Daddy's going out wrestling again. [rolls some paint on him downwards] Paaiint. [rolls some paint on him upwards] Paaiint. [turns around and walks away, leaving a confused Butters behind] Must be made clean. New.
Butters
Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. [opens the door and exits.]
Linda
[alone with her thoughts in front of a family photo] Must clean Butters. [paints over her face] Clean. Never be clean. Must... [paints over Butters' face] kill? The only way? Must kill Butters. [paints some more over their faces] Paaiint.

The White Swallow Spa, night. Butters is at its front doors and rings the buzzer. The doors open and he enters He jumps up and gives the attendant some money - $10.
Butters
One please.
Attendant
Locker two thirteen! [a towel pops out through a dispenser next to the window]
Butters
Uh thanks! [takes the towel and heads for the spa's locker room.]
The locker room. The camera pans across the locker room and shows nothing but men in towels. Some of them are exercising, others just chat.
Butters
[appears in the doorway] Dad? [walks in] Dad, you in here?
A hallway. Butters happens upon a wooden door with a small window in the upper half. He looks up at the window, then enters the room.
Butters
Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
Man
[voice only] There, do you think that works?
Mr. Garrison
[voice only] Well, that's four fingers; try five.
Butters
Uh, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
...Who is that?!
The main hallway. Butters enters and checks the first door to his left. Two men walk towards the entrance and walk out
Butters
[reaches the second door to his left, which is ajar] Da-ad? Da-ad?? [pushes the door open] Are you wrestlin' in here? [gets a better look: two men are engaged in anal intercourse] Dad?
Mr. Slave
This room's taken.
Butters
Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs. [exits and closes that door, then moves to the opposite room and looks in] Dad? No. [leaves that room and moves to the third door to his right] Hm. [opens the door: his father is masturbating, but Butters doesn't know what that is.]
Chris
[sees his son at the door and quickly covers himself] OOH! BUTTERS!
Butters
Hi Dad! [waves and smiles]
Chris
[now with towel in hand] Oh God! Aaah! Ohhh!
Butters
I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
Chris
[quite embarrassed, has the towel in position] Butters, you need... to leave here right now! You need to... get out of here, egeh... Go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you.
Butters
Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. [backs out and closes the door]

Butters' house, night. Butters' dad is in his study.
Chris
[closes a book, rises and calls out] Butters! Oh Butters! Could you come and see me in my study real quick?
Butters
[appears in the doorway] Uh, hey Dad.
Chris
Come here, son. [taps his lap. Butters enters and approaches] I wanna have a talk with you.
Butters
[hops onto his father's lap] Well, sure thing, Dad.
Chris
Son, I wanted to talk to you about lying.
Butters
Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
Chris
Yes, it sure can be. [pause] But, there are also times when distorting the truth a little, uh, is appropriate. These are called "little white lies."
Butters
Little white lies?
Chris
You see, sometimes telling a little white lie is okay. Like, for instance, when you catch your father jacking off in a gay men's bath house.
Butters
...Uh, who's Jack?
Chris
Butters, the point is that, I think that if you told Mommy what Daddy was doing tonight, well, she might go completely insane.
Butters
Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.
Chris
It won't? Oh, good.
Butters
Eh, no. Because I already told Mom and she's fine.
Chris
You... what?
Linda
[In the doorway] Butters, Mommy wants to take you for a little drive now.
Butters
A drive? Oh, boy! [puts his fists together twice] I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
Linda
No, sweetie, Daddy needs to sit and think.
Butters
[hops off his dad's lap] Alright. See ya in a bit, Dad. [walks out after his mother] Oh boy, a drive!
Boat dock, night, some minutes later. Mom drives onto a boat ramp and edges close to the water. A song plays on the radio: "Jingle Bell Rock." She slows the car to a stop.
Butters
Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
Linda
[with a blank expression on her face] Butters, you know that Mommy loves you an awful lot, don't you?
Butters
Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
Linda
And sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies, but it's really for the best.
Butters
Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' "nutsack" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
Linda
If a mommy has to end her life, she can't let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert.
Butters
Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere? [begins searching] It's cold out here.
Linda
I'm going to get out of the car now, Butters. [Butters looks up at her] I want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened.
Butters
Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then. [she moves the gear shift to neutral, releases the emergency brake, opens the driver-side door, and exits. She walks away from the water, and the car starts to move forward] You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom. [cut to a view of the water from the dock] Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
Linda
[close up. Her hands are together, fingertips touching] Shhh. Shhh. It's okay, baby. Mommy will be with you very soon.
Butters
[a view of the dock from the water] Well, I think I- Yup, it looks like the car is fillin' up with water! [she turns away as the car leaves the dock] Yeah. I think right now might be a good time to try to get the car out, Mom! [she walks away]

Butters' house, night, living room. His mom has returned home and is now writing a note. A noose hangs over the coffee table, ready for her to use when the time comes. His father, apparently, is not home
Linda
"Dear bastard husband," No. [scribbles over the words, then writes] "Dear lying sonofabitch," No. [scribbles over the words, then writes] "Dear assface," Yeah, that's it. "I will no longer-"
Chris
[enters the front door and quickly grasps the situation] Linda?? What are you doing?? [moves behind the sofa and to the lamp. Linda rises and quickly moves to the noose, then puts it on defiantly]
Linda
Stay away from me, bastard!
Chris
Linda, I know this is very hard-
Linda
[snaps back] You don't know anything!
Chris
I've been wanting to stop going to those places, Linda, but I couldn't. I still love you!
Linda
[sobbing] Then why, Chris, why?!
Chris
It just... it started as some curiosity on the Internet. I would chat with other married guys in the chat rooms and... Well the things they would talk about, Linda, I, I don't know why I found it exciting. I just did, and it, and it grew from there and it spun out of control, and- eh, ugh, DAMN YOU, INTERNET!
Linda
Well, [glares at him] you don't have to worry about your family being in your way anymore! [turns away and sobs]
Chris
No, Linda! I don't want that lifestyle! It's just kind of an addiction. I want help. And I'm going to get help. Please, just give me a chance to make this all up to you. [she removes the noose and falls to the floor] We can have a normal life!
Linda
There is no going back, Chris!
Chris
Sure there is!
Linda
No! [turns to face him] Our son is dead!
Chris
What?
Linda
[sobbing] I killed him. [collects her thoughts] I was going to end it all, and everything spun out of control for me. I drowned Butters in the car, Chris!
Chris
Oh no. [Linda cries loudly] No! No, no, Jesus! Linda, what were you thinking?
Linda
[snaps] I WASN'T THINKING! [catches her breath] I couldn't think! You destroyed my life, you! [points at him, then breaks down] Oh, God, what have I done?! Oh, Butter-her-hers-ss-ss- [dissolves into sobs]
Chris
[confused] This can't be happening! This is a bad dream.
Linda
Just go away and let me die! [sobs]
Chris
[genuflects next to her] No! Linda, we-
Linda
I'm a murderer, Chris! I don't have a life now! [lays down on the floor face first and pounds it with her right fist]
Chris
Linda, Butters is gone. [drops into thought] Oh Christ, if Butters is gone, then... there's nothing we can do about that. But I won't let you go to jail, I promise, Linda! Pleeease! [she start weeping, then he starts, and they both weep...]
A river, day. The family car come into view, floating down the river, with Butters still strapped in.
Butters
Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now. [the car floats down some more and crashes into some boulders. The passenger-side door flies open] Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt. [unfastens it and lets it go. He scrambles out and over the boulders] Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home. [before him are some low hills and the Rockies in the background. No buildings in sight] Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?

News 4 Reporter
Tom, I'm standing in front of the home of Chris and Linda Stotch. They're living every parent's nightmare right now, as last night, while Ms. Stotch was driving with her son in the car, a man stopped her, put a gun to her head, and took her son away. When asked who the man was, Ms. Stotch replied, "Some Puerto Rican guy." Naturally, the police are in an all-out manhunt for Some Puerto Rican Guy. [the front door behind him opens and the Stotches appear] Uh, it looks like the parents are about to make a statement, Tom. [cameras start snapping pictures. Officer Barbrady and fellow police officers form a barricade to keep the crowd away from the podium.]
Reporter 1
Mrs. Stotch? Mrs. Stotch? Any word yet from the man who took your son?
Linda
No, no, not yet. But if you're out there, we beg you: we just want our baby returned safely back to us.
News 4 Reporter
Mrs. Stotch, what did the kidnapper look like?
Linda
Puerto Rican.
Reporter 2
Was he tall? Short?
Linda
He was... average Puerto Rican height. Please, just bring our baby back to me.

Truck Driver
Yeah. Too bad you're not a broad, 'cause I need some God-damned poontang.
Butters
Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.

Butters' house, day. The news crews and the crowd are gone. Inside, the parents sit on the sofa as the police and detectives handle the case. The phone rings. Chris rises, but the police chief stops him
Police Chief

Rob's Sassy Ladys titty bar. A few men sit around looking at an exotic dancer works her way around a pole. Butters is at a pay phone nearby
Butters
Oh. Hello? Uh, who is this?
Barbrady
Who is this?
Butters
Uh, is this the Stotch residence?
Barbrady
Yes. Are you calling about the abduction?
Butters
...No.
Barbrady
Oh. Well, are you Puerto Rican?
Butters
[looks down and checks himself out] ...No.
Barbrady
We need to keep this line clear. Call back another day. [hangs up and faces the family and officers] It wasn't the abductors, sorry.
Officer 1
[enters the front door] Chief! Two more parents from the next town over have shown up saying their child might have been killed by the same guy that took the Stotch boy.

Butters
Sir? Hello?
Mechanic
[leaves the car to see Butters] Hallo, what can I do for ya?
Butters
Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
Mechanic
Sarrih, wife took the car to Estes Park for the weekend. Won't be back until Sunday, hyeah. I can give you a ride Sunday, if ya like.
Butters
I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
Mechanic
Well, then, looks like you're walkin'.
Butters
Uh will I eventually get to South Park if I follow this road? [points to the road on the left]
Mechanic
'Aht road leads to Conifuh. You want to go to South Park, you gotta go down that rod. [the camera pans to the right and stops at a terrifying road. It is lined with spooky trees with faces on them, dark threatening clouds overhead, and eerie sounds.] 'Course, I ain't nevuh seen anyone go up that rod. Six years ago a group of campers went up there and got lost. Had to eat each other to say alive. Used to be the way to O'Riley house. He butchered over fifty children and kept their bodies in a cellah. But, you should find an old bridge about halfway up. That bridge is cursed, you know? They built it with the bones of two hundred Chinese laborers who were massacred in '34. Yeah. Lotta history down that rod.
Butters
[unsure, blinks] ...Well, it's my parents' anniversary tomorrow, [starts walking] and they're gonna be awful sad if I'm not there with 'em.
Mechanic
Well, uh good luck then.

Hello, Gary. Great to see you. Chris and Linda, this is our good friend, Congressman Gary Condit. [Condit approaches the table, waves hello, and takes a seat next to Linda] He also lost someone close to him and thinks it something to do with the same Puerto Rican guy that hurt our kids.
Gary Condit
We're goin' tuh get that sonofabitch! [grins. That grin is fixed in place]

Yes, I'd I sure hope we do.

Butters
For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's

Buffalo wings and fried cheese sticks, the best are found at... Bennigan's
[a snarling sound is heard. He stops and turns right, looking into the trees]
Uhuh, hello?
[after a while of looking, he turns left and starts walking again]
So come and eat at...

[whispering] Why can't he see us?
Butters
...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.

Someone looks back, and turns on thermal vision. A neon view of Butters is shown. Butters turns left and start walking again. The three dots remain trained on his forehead]

Chris
Naw, Linda! Because you can't now say that the abductor is Costa Rican! [rises] You have to learn to keep it straight!
Linda
I can't keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story!
Chris
Hey, don't forget that I'm covering for you! [the door opens and Butters walks in]
Linda
Don't forget: your lies started all this. [Butters closes the door]
Chris
My lies may have been deceitful, but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything I ever did! [Butters approaches and looks]
Butters
Happy Anniversary!
Chris
Not now, Butters!
Butters
Oh. [moves off to his left] Alright, then. I-
Linda
Butters?? [spots him and scoops him up, then shares him with Chris]Oh, Butters!
Chris
Son! I don't believe it! [they both drop on one knee as they hold on to Butters]
Butters
Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
Linda
Oh, my baby's back!
Butters
I ain't grounded, am I?
Chris
No-huih, no, Butters. Oh, son, why... [relief fades to spin] Oh... Uh, we're gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where you've been though, alright?
Butters
Lie?
Linda
Oh. Eh yes. Uh darling, you're going to have to say you don't know how you got home.
Chris
No! You have to say that a Puerto Rican man dropped you off! [both parents set Butters down and rise]
Linda
Ohhh, who's gonna believe he just dropped him off?!
Butters
Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.
Chris
[over Butters' voice] Now we don't really have a choice, do we?!
Linda
You're the one that made up the stuff about the Puerto Rican, IDIOT!
Butters
Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.
Chris
Well you're the one who couldn't back it up wit a description, stupid!
Butters
Now gosh darn it, you! [steps in between his parents] You listen here! Now I am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies. You know, you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine, but it's still a shovel, Mom and Dad. Ah, and you can call a lie whatever you want, but it's still a no-good stinkin' lie! And when you start coverin' up one lie with another why, now that's when you get into real trouble! [Chris and Linda listen] Boy I've, I've just about had it up to here [puts his right hand to his chin, palm down] with you two! [a few seconds of silence follow]
Chris
...Butters... You're as right as rain.
Linda
[genuflects and messes with Butters' hair] You sure are.
Butters
Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
Linda
No, Butters. You're the best son in the whole world. [Chris walks over to the phone as Linda and Butters look at each other] And I am so happy you're alive.
Butters
...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?

You bet, son. But Mommy and Daddy have something they have to do first. [picks up the receiver and starts dialing...]

Man in Crowd
Wow, alright
Stan
Butters was missing?
Chris
But, that isn't all we have to say. You see, we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us.
Butters
[points at the crowd] Yeah!
Linda
We've learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean.
Butters
Yeah! [a shot of the Ramseys, O.J., and Condit]

You see, I've been deceiving my wife for several months. I was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers.
Butters
[raises both arms in victory] Ye-! [turns to look at his father, and his arms go down] wait, what?
Cartman
Huho!
Linda
[Butters is now afraid of what she might say] And when I found out I went crazy, I went crazy and I drove my son into the lake to kill 'im.
Butters
Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!
Stan
Damn, dude.
Chris
So you see, there was no "Some Puerto Rican Guy." He doesn't exist. And so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the Ramseys, Congressman Condit, and O.J. We gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and, we're sorry. Now we're just happy we won't have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You're a liar! You're a LIAR!" [points at the crowd, and Condit's fixed-grin face is shown] "You know somethin' that you're not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!" [back to Chris] Eh you know, that's what people would say to me. And then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say, "Hello," but they'd be thinking, "Ah, there goes that MURDERER!" [a shot of O.J.] "You got away with MURDER you murdering, lying, waste of life!" [back to Chris] And to me, people might say things like, [a shot of Condit] "LIAR! Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!" [back to Chris] And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like, [a shot of the Ramseys] "You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!" [a shot of O.J.] "CONFESS!" [a shot of Condit] "LIAR! CONFESS!" [back to Chris] You know, and, that's what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.
Linda
We're sorry we lied to you all. It won't happen again.
Chris
And now, if you'll excuse us, this family has to get to Bennigan's.
Man 2 in Crowd
Yeah-ah-alright! [the parents go back in the house as a stunned Butters stands on the walkway. The crowd disperses and Stan, Kyle, and Cartman walk up to Butters]
Stan
Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
Butters
Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
Cartman
We sure are.
Butters
I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
Stan
Really?
Butters
Naw, I'm lyin'
Chris
[appears in the doorway] Let's go, son.
Butters
Wuh comin', Dad! [goes inside the house]
Choir
Everyone knows it's Butters!

Butters
[returns to the doorway and points to himself with his thumb] That's me!
End of Butters' Very Own Episode

Jared Has Aides
Cartman's house, living room, day. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle are on the sofa laughing as Cartman does some prank calls.
Cartman
[dialing] Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. [the boys quiet down and cover their mouths as the call goes through to City Wok, a Chinese restaurant.]
Tuong Lu Kim
Herro, Shitty Wok, take your order prease.
Cartman
[the boys giggle] Hello, is this City Wok?
Tuong Lu Kim
Yes, this Shitty Wok
Cartman
[the boys giggle harder] Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.
Tuong Lu Kim
[writing] Shitty Beef...
Kyle
Aha, and I'll have the City Chicken.
Tuong Lu Kim
[writing] Shitty Chicken... [the boys roar with laughter. Cartman rolls back on the sofa]
Stan
Oh, dude, look! [the others look up and the phone falls off Cartman's lap to the floor] It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
Commercial. The first thing on the screen is a submarine sandwich. It pans across the screen.
Singer
He's still lookin' good!
[a man appears eating a footlong subway sandwich. The name "JARED FOGLE" appears on the screen near the bottom]
His name is Jared
[he struts down a sidewalk. "LOST 262 LBS." appears on the screen]
His name is Jared and he likes to eat the sandwiches...
[a side shot of Jared walking smoothly behind a white picket fence in Downtown, then of slices of a party sub, then of the first sandwich]

Cartman living room. Butters walks in.
Butters
Uh, hey, fellas.
Stan
Hey Kenny.
Butters
[upset] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
Kyle
Okay, Not-Kenny.
Commercial continues.
Announcer
Hey South Park! [camera switches to the TV. Jared is shown munching away on a sub sandwich behind splash bubbles saying "JARED LIVE" "FREE SUBS" and "LOSE WEIGHT" and "MEET JARED" "SOUTH PARK, COLORADO"] You can meet Jared IN PERSON March 6 at the Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square!
Butters
[excited] Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!
Kyle
Dude! That's today!
Stan
We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! [Stan and Kyle hop off the sofa and head for the front door]
Butters
[angered] Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!
Cartman
[hops off and follows Stan and Kyle] Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.
Butters
Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. [follows the other three. The phone remains on the floor]
Tuong Lu Kim
[the receiver rattles with his voice] Hello! City Wok! City Wok, I take your order prease!
Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square, moments later. A crowd is in front of the stage waiting for Jared, with people holding up signs saying "We Love Jared" "We Love You Jared!!" "Jared for President", etc. The boys walk up to Herbert Garrison. Kyle taps him.
Kyle
Excuse me? Could we get through here?
Herbert Garrison
[turns around] Hell no! I've been savin' this spot for six hours! [begins to dance]
His name is Garrison, Mr. Garrison. He lost ten pounds takin' Jared's lead-

Randy
Here he comes! [the crowd turns left as one and starts clamoring. Jared struts towards the crowd as his theme song comes up]
Singer
He's still lookin' good, with all those... sub sandwiches... [Jared walks up on stage and takes the podium]
Jared
Thank you all so much. You know what? After a year of eating delicious sub sandwiches, I've proven weight loss is easy! [the crowd cheers] And I promise you, I will always be your faithful leader in easy weight loss!
Some men
Alright! [more cheering]
Cartman
That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
South Park, later. A knock is heard and a door opens. Jared is seen eating a sub at a desk. A worker peaks in.
Worker
Mr. Fogle, some fans wanted to see if you'd sign their sandwich?
Jared
Sure, let 'em in. [the worker lets the boys in and Jared spins around to face them] Hi kids. [the room Jared is in is a dressing room]
Butters
Wow, Jared!
Kyle
Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
Jared
I sure did! And- Well- Well I, I also had a little help on the side.
Stan
What kind of help?
Jared
Well, eating sub sandwiches was a big part of it. But the way that I lost so much weight was that I got aides.
Cartman
A- AIDS?
Jared
That's right. I got aides about two years ago and I've been losing weight ever since. It's amazing how slim you can get with aides.
Stan
I'll bet you can.
Jared
Would you like to meet them?
Kyle
[steps backwards] Them?
Jared
My aides. Scott! Tyler! [moves to the door. The two aides come in and Jared stands behind them. Then he looks at the blond to his left] Scott is my personal trainer [looks at the light brunet to his right] and Tyler is my dietitian.
Scott, Tyler
Hello.
Kyle
Oh, "A I D E S," aides.
Jared
Yep. Hooray for aides!
Kyle
Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
Jared
I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.
Kyle
But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
Jared
Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter?
Kyle
It matters, dude. [Jared begins to think...]
Jared
Hmmm.
Main Street, moments later. The boys walk along...
Kyle
That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
Stan
Yeah, it's only in America that somebody can become famous just because they go from being a big fatass to not being a big fatass.
Cartman
Oh-my-god! [turns around] You guys! I think I'm having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.
Kyle
Tha- that's diarrhea.
Cartman
Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
Stan
[following] Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
Cartman
[softly] That's right Stan. [bolder] It's a cash cow, I tell you.
Kyle
That's a great idea!
Cartman
Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
Butters
[surprised, steps backwards] Me?!
Cartman
Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
Butters
Oh, no, I thought you meant you. Eh, you're the fat one.
Cartman
I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
Kyle
But Butters isn't fat.
Cartman
That's my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.
Stan
He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
Butters
But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
Cartman
Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
Butters
You mean like Jared?
Kyle
Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
Butters
[angrily] Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!
Stan
You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight...
His name is Butters, it's Butters. [the boys begin to sway for each line]

Cartman
He used to be fat but not no more [Butters brightens up]
Kyle
City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
Stan
Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls.
Cartman
[slowing] and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
Butters
[beaming] Wow.
Le Place Restaurant, night. Jared is dining with a woman inside.
Jared
Christine, you know I love you very much, and I, I can't wait for the wedding.
Christine
I love you too, Jared. You've changed my whole life.
Her name is Jonez, Christine Jonez
She lost forty pounds when she met Jared-

Jared
Yeh, I know I know, I know. But uh... some young boys were talkin' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something.
Christine
Jared, what's this all about?
Jared
Uh, Christine, this isn't probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides.
Christine
What?!
Jared
Yeah, I have aides. I've had aides since before we were together. [Christine's jaw drops] What, what are you thinking? Are you bummed?
Christine
Am I bummed?! [moves her chair away from Jared and faces him] You've had AIDS all this time and you knew it?!
Jared
Well of course I knew it.
Christine
Why the hell wouldn't you tell me?!
Jared
I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
Christine
Not that big of a deal?! I slept with you!
Jared
Aren't you overreacting a little bit?
Christine
Well, Jesus Christ! We're supposed to get married!
Jared
We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they're my aides now, but after we get married... they'll be our aides [Christine sobs] You'll love having aides, Christine, you really will. And when we have children, they'll have aides. It'll make things so simple! [Christine throws up her arms, rises from her chair, and runs out of the restaurant sobbing] Christine! [rises and moves to follow Christine, but stops to think] Jeez, those boys were right. People really don't like aides. I'd better tell everyone the truth.
South Park Elementary, next day. The boys enter the kitchen to get their meals.
Chef
Hello there, children.
Kyle
Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
Chef
Fifty pounds? Why?
Cartman
Uuuh, school project.
Chef
Well, if you want him to get really fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.
Stan
Marry him?
Chef
It definitely worked for every woman I ever met.
Butters
Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
Kyle
Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.
Butters
[self-conscious] Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?
Chef
Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way. Come on back, children. [all of them move away from the counter and towards the back]
The kitchen, food preparation area. The camera pans across the table showing pots, pans, and dishes with food all over the place. It rests on Butters trying to finish off a plate, but struggling.
Butters
Ugh. [sets his plate down] Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
Kyle
You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. [scoops out a tablespoon and hands it to Butters, but Butters doesn't take it. Chef enters and Butters begins to throw up]
Stan
[notices] Chef, we need more food.
Chef
I'm runnin' out, children. [leaves. Butters vomits some more]
Cartman
Damnit Butters! Keep eating or I'll kick you till you're deader than Kenny!
Stan
[soberly] Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
Cartman
So how long until we can joke about it?
Kyle
Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
Cartman
Wugh, that's a long time to wait.
Butters
Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
Cartman
Then eat your puke.
Butters
No!
Cartman
Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. [Butters looks at Cartman, then at his puke. Reluctantly he scoops it up and eats it.]
Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square, later.
Subway Representative
Ladies and gentlemen, we at Subway are happy to inform you that Jared has elected to stay in South Park in order to speak to you once again! [the crowd oohs and aaha]
Man 1
He's going to speak with us once again!
Subway Representative
So, here he is, Jared! [the crowd cheers, and Jared is again walking towards them, grinning]
Singer
He's still lookin' good, eatin' them sandwiches all the time...[Jared walks up on stage and takes the podium]
Jared
Thank you-hoo, thank you all. Subway is a healthy way to eat fast food and lose weight!
Subway Representative
All right! [pumps his arm as the crowd reacts]
Jared
But, [the crowd quiets down] I feel like I need to come a little clean about something, uh-... it wasn't just Subway sandwiches that made me thin.
Subway Representative
...Huh?
Jared
The reason I was able to lose so much weight so quickly was that I got aides. [grins with relief. The rep's jaw drops.]
Man 2
Huh?
Man 3
What?
Man 4
Did he say AIDS?
Jared
But I still wanna be the leader in a fitter America, and so I'm here to tell you, that you should ALL go out and get aides! [the crowd immediately begins to disperse]
Man 2
Oh my God!
A woman
Is he serious?
Jared
Having aides - is - awesome! With aides you can literally watch the fat melt away! And with the proper mix of aides and Subway sandwiches, anything is possible! [the rep, looking on in dismay, has had enough and pushes Jared out of the way to take the mic]
Subway Representative
Uh, the opinions expressed by Mr. Fogle are not necessarily those of the Subway Company. [Jared soothes his left arm a bit]
Cartman's living room, some days later. Stan is measuring Butters' girth and grins at the result. Camera zooms out.
Kyle
Wow! He looks great!
Stan
How do you feel, Butters?
Butters
W-well, k-kinda like Cartman. [Cartman slaps Butters and shakes him] Aw!
Cartman
Get a hold of yourself, man!
Stan
Alright, now it's time for phase 2.
City Wok, moments later. The boys walk towards it and enter. The owner greets them.
Tuong Lu Kim
Welcome to Shitty Wok. You rike to try Shitty Chicken today?
Cartman
Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
Tuong Lu Kim
You want the Shitty Beef?
Kyle
Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
Tuong Lu Kim
Which one? I see two fat friends.
Cartman
[pointing to Butters] The fat one!
Stan
We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
Tuong Lu Kim
...Why?
Kyle
Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh! You mean like-a Jared?!
Cartman
Just like Jared.
Tuong Lu Kim
His name is Jared, he lose some weight. Shitty Wok food sure is great. Yeah, okay. That sound good. Saw if he lose weight eating Shitty Wok, I pay use to use him in commercial.
The Boys
All right!
Cartman
Sir, we are in business!
Subway company boardroom, day. Jared has been called in to see the board.
Subway Representative
[second from left] Jared, first of all we want to say that all of us here at Subway appreciate everything you've done for our company.
Jared
[happily] Well, I appreciate your company doing everything it's done for me.
Subway Rep 2
[second from right] Yes, well, it is now the opinion of all of us that perhaps it would be best for you to take your... strange theories on weight loss elsewhere.
Jared
[crestfallen] ...'Scuse me... am I being fired?
Subway Rep 3
[center] Jared, it's just that your new take on weight loss is contrary to our commitment to good health.
Jared
How so?
Subway Representative
Well, your new slogan, for instance. [clears his throat] "When it comes to fitness, Subway goes hand in hand with aides."
Jared
[softly] Ah-hah. [he rises and leaves the "SANDWICH MARKETING" building with hands in pockets. He closes the door and walks away dejectedly. He passes a basketball court where a few people are shooting baskets. He looks at them as he passes by. Then he stops, looks at the camera, sighs, and]
Singer
His name is Jared. Jared lost weight eating Subway, now he's cold and alone and with no place to call his home. He liked sandwiches with Philadelphia cream cheese.
Flex Gym Fitness Club, day.
Cartman
[heard from the outside] Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again! [the camera goes inside. People are exercising on all sorts of equipment. A woman runs by on a track on the second floor. Butters is pulling at a rowing machine as Cartman spots him. Cartman is eating Cheesy Poofs and barking orders] You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
Butters
[looks at Cartman] Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
Cartman
[normal] Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
Butters
Well alright then.
Cartman
[barking] Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
Jared's dressing room, day. Jared paces the room eating a sub sandwich.
Jared
I never asked to be famous; now everyone hates me! I almost wish I had never gotten aides! [his aides come in]
Tyler
Hey now, come on. What kind of talk is that?
Jared
I'm sorry, guys, but I...I think I wanna be aides-free for a while.
Scott
Come on, Jared, lighten up! People don't hate you.
Tyler
Yeah. Maybe they're all just jealous that they can't afford to hire their own aides.
Jared
[brightening] Wait a minute... you're right! [moves towards the camera] Yeah! I think I know how to be a celebrity again! [heads for the door]
City Wok, outside, later. Cartman and Kyle wait on Stan as he arrives.
Stan
Did you bring the camera?
Kyle
Yeah, we're all set.
Cartman
[steps in between them] Guys, I think this might be a good time to discuss some business.
Kyle
Well, what do you mean?
Cartman
Well, when City Wok sees how skinny Butters is, they're not gonna want him to just make one commercial, they're gonna want several.
Stan
That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
Cartman
I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
Kyle
Wow! [he and Stan are awed]
Cartman
Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
Butters
[arrives as Cartman speaks] Hey fellas.
Stan
Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
Kyle
Yeah, you're still fat!
Butters
Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
Cartman
Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
Butters
Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
Cartman
No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!
Stan
[Kyle finally produces the camera] Did you eat only one ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
Butters
Well uh yeah, but ah, I don't know...
Kyle
Why are you doing this to us?!
Butters' house, later. The boys have prepared a makeshift operating table on the coffee table in the living room. Kyle reads from a medical book, Cartman has a suction tube and pail, and Stan is overseeing the operation.
Stan
All prepared for liposuction surgery?
Cartman
Check.
Butters
Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.
Stan
[shoots back] Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. [Cartman makes sure the scalpel is sharp]
Kyle
[faces Stan] Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
Cartman
That should blah [babbles a bit] ah- here. [cuts into Butters' abdomen]
Butters
[reacts] Woahhh!
Cartman
Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
Kyle
Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. [Cartman picks up one end of the tube and inserts it into the incision]
Cartman
Alrighty.
Butters
Whoa. I think this is a bad idea, fellas. I feel woozy.
Cartman
Alright, I think it's in. [turns around]
Kyle
The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. [Cartman stalls, then picks up the other end and starts sucking the fat out]
Cartman
[spits out the hose as soon as the fat hits his lips] Bohogh, egh. [puts the hose into the pail for the fat to collect]
Butters
Waaaahh!
Cartman
There it goes.
Kyle
Alright, it's working!
Cartman
[wipes away a bit of fat remaining on his lips] Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
Butters
Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
Stan
Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
Butters
Everything's getting dark...
Stan
We've gotta hurry this up. [moves behind the coffee table to Butter's belly and starts pounding on it. The fat begins flowing out faster]
Cartman
[looks at the fat flowing out] Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.
Stan
He's losing weight. [Kyle smiles]
Cartman
Oh, whoa. Whoa! [the fat rushes out so quickly the tube begins to buck, splattering fat and blood all over the place]
Kyle
It's out of control! [Stan has stopped pounding, but the fat is pulsing out and Cartman can't control it.. Butters gets thinner by the second and headed for shock]
Butters
Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. [the sound of a car pulling up is heard]
Stan
Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.
Cartman
Oh, crap!
Stan
Dude, bail! [the three boys rush out the back door, then the front door opens and Butter's parents walk in. The living room is a mess]
Linda
Butters? Butters?!
Butters
[listlessly] Mom. Dad.
Stephen
Butters. Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth!
Butters
Yes sir.
Linda
This is unbelievable! How many times have we told you not to have self-perform liposuction surgery in our house?!
Butters
Four times, mom.
Stephen
Well, I guess that wasn't enough! You get up to your room right now, mister!
Butters
Yes, sir. [rises and... struggles. He falls off the coffee table to the floor. Stephen isn't fazed, but Linda is affected]
Stephen
Oh, huh- Don't you give us that look young man! You're gonna get it!
News 4 News, day. A field reporter stands in front of the Mayor's office. The mayor and her aides are present.
Reporter
Tom, I'm standing out in front of the Mayor's office, where the big liar, Jared, is once again about to speak. Apparently, Jared hopes to regain his celebrity hero status, which was lost when he announced that it was AIDS, not sub sandwiches, that caused him to lose weight. Let's listen in.
The podium. Jared stands behind it.
Jared
Ladies and gentlemen, a-at first I didn't understand why you felt betrayed by the fact that my aides helped me to lose weight, but now I understand that it isn't fair that- I had aides and most of you don't. And so, with all the money I've made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation!
Jimbo
What?!
Jared
I am going to personally see to it that each and every one of you gets aides! [a long silence follows as the audience just looks at Jared]
Mayor McDaniels
This guy's insane.
Jared
But I won't stop there. I'm gonna seek out all the underprivileged and hungry children of the world, and I'm going to give them aides myself!
Chef
You're gonna give children AIDS?!
Jared
Yes, it is my hope that every beautiful child on this earth has aides by next month! Aides for everyone! [another long silence]
Skeeter
Get him! [the crowd begins to move forward angrily and Jared leaves the podium]
Butters' house, some days later. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman show up at the front door, and Cartman rings the bell.
Stan
Come on, Butters. Time to go.
Butters
Uh- go where?
Kyle
To City Wok so we can make our money. God!
Butters
I can't go anywhere, fellas. I've been grounded for havin' liposuction... surgery. [lifts his shorts to show the bandage over the scar]
Stan
What?
Butters
Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
Cartman
Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
Butters
[counts off] Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?! [moves his hands palms down to wash his hands of any more trouble] Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
Stan
...Kenny would have done it.
Kyle
Yep.
Cartman
Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was? [whispers] God. [normally] He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
Butters
Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
Cartman
Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
Butters
No- but you don't sound like me.
Cartman
[begins sounding something like Butters. Kyle looks on] Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
Kyle
Wow, that was pretty good.
Stan
Alright, it's settled. Come on, Butters. [pulls Butters out the door. Cartman enters the house]
Cartman
Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! [the others leave and he closes the door]
Stotch living room, inside. Cartman moves to the sofa.
Cartman
Eh. [makes himself comfortable on the sofa and turns on the TV. He grunts a bit] Eh. Yeah. [the phone rings; he answers] Well hello?
Stephen
[at an office full of cubicles] I'm just checking in on you, Butters. [a woman walks down the aisle behind him] Heh- Do I hear the television? We told you no television while you're grounded!
Cartman
Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
Stephen
Jacking it? Jacking what?
Cartman
Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.
Stephen
WHAT?! Are you trying to get yourself in more trouble with that kind of language?!
Cartman
Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
Stephen
OH YOU'RE GONNA GET IT MISTER! Just wait until I get home!
Cartman
Bring it on, queer bait. [hangs up] Aaaahhhh, yes! [puts his arms behind his head, quite satisfied with himself]
Day, somewhere. Jared has a bat and is beating the hell out of something...
Jared
...I tell my [paf] girlfriend I have aides and she leaves, I tell the [paf] world to get aides and they think I'm crazy, I offer to give aides to kids and everyone wants me [paf] dead! [the camera pulls back and the thing Jared is beating is a dead horse. Literally] What's wrong with [paf] aides?! Why doesn't anyone want me to give them [paf] aides?! [the crowd arrives with torches, charging noisily]
Herbert Garrison
There he is, beatin' that dead horse!
Man in Crowd
Alright!
Jimbo
Let's get him! [the crowd charges forward and Jared runs away again]
Jared
Aahhh!
City Wok. Stan, Kyle, and Butters arrive and enter.
Tuong Lu Kim
Welcome ta Shitty Wok. Take your order prease.
Kyle
We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
Tuong Lu Kim
He lose weight eating Shitty Wok?
Stan
That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh no, no way! I not putting no Jared in my Shitty Wok commercial!
Kyle
Uh, why not?
Tuong Lu Kim
Don't you know? Everybody hate Jared. He want everyone in world to have AIDS. He sick in the head.
Stan
What?!
Tuong Lu Kim
I don't want Shitty Wok have nothing to do with Jared land his AIDS.
Stan
Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?
Tuong Lu Kim
Yah they, they gonna kill him. They gonna kill Jared downtown right now.
Stan
Ugh, come on guys, we gotta sort this out. [the boys exit the store]
Butters' house, living room. Cartman has eaten quite a bit of food (soda, milk, candy, Cheesy Poofs) and is watching TV - a Terrance & Phillip episode. Only their voices are heard.
Phillip
Here's a man's fart for ya. [farts, laughs]
Terrance
God no! [laughs again, and Cartman joins in. The phone rings] Oh, Phillip, your anthrax has given me colon cancer!
Cartman
[answering] Hello?
Linda
[calling in from her office] Butters, your father called and said you made him very upset!
Cartman
Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.
Linda
[stunned, then] Butters, where did you get that kind of smart mouth?!
Cartman
Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
Linda
OH YOU JUST WAIT until I get home MISTER!
Cartman
Oh, I'll be waiting with horse bells on, you old... horse-bangin' skank. [hangs up] Eh. [resumes eating]
Terrance
Ey! There's some anthrax over there! [farts, then roars with laughter]
Phillip
Oh no, hahahahahahaha.
Downtown, Mayor's office, outside, day. The crowd has captured Jared and taken him back downtown. A gallows is set up and Jared has had the noose placed around his neck. Two men finish and walk off. The Mayor stands off to one side with her aides.
Jared
Why did I ever do those stupid commercials?
Mayor McDaniels
Alright, Jared, you sick pervert! Do you have anything to say before you die?!
Kyle
[offscreen] Wait! [the boys run up to the gallows platform] You're all making a mistake!
Chef
Stand back, children! Jared wants to give you AIDS!
Stan
No, you don't understand. Jared doesn't have "AIDS," AIDS, he has assistants. Two guys that help him lose weight that he calls his aides.
People in Crowd
[softly] Oh.
Mayor McDaniels
You mean, Jared's aides are like my aides?
Jared
Yes. ...Y-you mean you all thought...? Oh my Gosh!
Skeeter
Oh boy, do I feel stupid.
Gerald
Oh we're so sorry, Jared.
Jared
No no, hey it was my fault. I can't believe I- I, I didn't think of what I was saying! [giggles]
Chef
Eh so he was saying, children should have help like he had! [laughs]
Randy
Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! [several people laugh]
Jared
[laughing] Oh my God! I told my girlfriend I wanted her to share my aides - oh, no wonder she left!
Herbert Garrison
[laughing] Cuh-can you imagine what we thought when you said, "Aides for Everyone Foundation?"
Jared
Oh, brother!
Skeeter
Aha- [stops and realizes something] ...Hey. We're all laughing. [everyone stops and listens]
Mr. Mackey
Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed about this before.
Randy
Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!
People in Crowd
Ooo.
Mayor McDaniels
He's right. It happened!
Jimbo
Hey everybody! AIDS is finally funny!
People in Crowd
Alright! Yay! Woohoo! [fireworks come up out of nowhere] Hooray!
Mr. Mackey
I knew it would be funny someday! [laughs] AIDS!
Herbert Garrison
Then it's time... We can undo the banner! [fanfare comes up, and a man pulls a curtain away to reveal a huge golden plaque reading "AIDS IS FINALLY FUNNY" Ooohs and aaahs follow.]
Cut to Times Square, where the crawl reads "3-06-02 AIDS HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY DECLARED FUNNY"
New Yorker
Hooray!
Cut to Mayor's office, outside. Everyone now has party hats on and are celebrating. The field reporter resumes reporting.
Reporter
Tom, I'm standing in the town square where just moments ago it was declared that AIDS... can finally be joked about. What a great day for humanity.
Herbert Garrison
[laughs, then] "AIDS quilt" [resumes laughing. The crowd disperses and Tuong Lu Kim finds the boys]
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh boy, this is fantastic! I so grad AIDS is funny now.
Stan
Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
Tuong Lu Kim
Sure 'kay. I pay you fifteen dowlars.
Stan
Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!
Tuong Lu Kim
Hey, I'm not a-Subway, I Shitty Wok. Shitty Wok don't have... million dollars.
Stan
[takes off his hat and throws it on the ground] Oh God-damnit!
Kyle
Aw, just forget the whole thing then!
Tuong Lu Kim
Okay. [walks off, returns] Hey, you kids know why chicken cross the road?
Stan
Why?
Tuong Lu Kim
'Cause it has AIDS. [laughs. The boys just look at him oddly] AIDS so funny! [walks away laughing]
Stan
Well, so much for our money.
Kyle
Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
Butters
Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded. [gasps] Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! [rushes away]
Butters' house, minutes later. Butters rushes to the front door.
Butters
Huh. Huh, uh, uh.
Cartman
[opens the door in anticipation] There you are, Butters!
Butters
[nervous] Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
Cartman
No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
Butters
Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
Cartman
No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
Butters
Hu-oh! Goody!
Cartman
Here you go. [hands Butters some drawings] I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
Butters
Uh- perfect.
Cartman
Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. [makes his way to the door]
Butters
Uh hey, uh Eric? [Cartman turns around] Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
Cartman
Butters, it was my pleasure. [pulls out his mittens and opens the door, then puts them on. He heads for the sidewalk humming a late night theme song, then turns around to frame the house with his fingers, then walks away]
Butters' house, outside. Cartman, still humming, returns with a beach chair, some popcorn, and soda, and sets them up on the front lawn. Then he sits down to look at the coming show. Two cars pull up: it's Butters' parents rushing home. They exit their cars and head for the door angrily. They enter...
Butters
Hi, Mom and Dad!
Stephen
DON'T YOU HI MOM AND DAD US YOU LITTLE PUNK!!! "(Punch)"
Butters
Ow! Dad?
Linda
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE TROUBLE YOU'RE IN MISTER! "(Punch)"
Butters
Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
Stephen
YOU THINK YOU'RE TOUGH NOW?! ANSWER ME!!! [a belt is heard coming off and whipping Butters]
Butters
Aaaa!! [the beating continues]
Cartman
Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
End of Jared Has Aides

Asspen
Butters' house, night, kitchen. Linda is serving drinks. The Marshes and the Broflovskis are at table. Sheila holds Ike on her lap.
Sharon
Thanks for having us all over for dinner, Chris and Linda.
Sheila
Yes, it was fabulous!
Linda
Oh, we're just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little Butters!
Stephen
Yeah. We figure that if our boys are gonna be great friends, we should all get to be friends, too.
Linda
Friends, by default. [giggles]
Randy
Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.
Stephen
Well, our son is a perfect void-filler. It's nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies!
Butters' house, living room. The four boys sit on the sofa looking at television, except Butters is asleep at one end.
Cartman
[alerting the other two] Look you guys, Butters is asleep.
Stan
He's such a douchebag.
Cartman
Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick? [drops down] When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water, [takes a glass of water and brings it to Butters' hand] and you put their hand in it... [dunks Butters' hand in it]
Stan
[watches as Cartman climbs the sofa] Yeah, and then what?
Cartman
And then, you pee on it! [drops his pants and pees on Butters' hand] heheh-heheheheheheheh.
Kyle
No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
Cartman
[still peeing] Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh.
Butters' house, kitchen. Conversation goes on.
Stephen
And we were thinking, since they've all become such close friends, how great it would be for us to all go together to Aspen for a ski weekend.
Gerald
A-Aspen? Uuuh, we, we can't really afford that.
Stephen
No, you see, Linda and I found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in Aspen if you attend a time-share presentation.
Randy
They let you stay for free?
Stephen
Yes! And all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting!
Sheila
Well that sounds like a good deal.
Randy
Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
Sheila
Oh, boy! Skiing in Aspen! I can't wait! [an '80s tune begins to play. A shot of the boys in the living room, then the adults pour in from the kitchen]
Stephen
Hey boys! We're all going to Aspen for the weekend!
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
All right! [Butters stirs awake]
Butters
Wow, a ski trip with my new best buddies! [feels some tension as he stretches] Oh, I'm all sticky. [wipes his hands on the sofa and cushions]
The Rocky Mountains, day. Stephen Stotch drives all three families and Cartman off to Aspen.
Stephen
Here we are, everyone. [Before them lies a valley with many buildings in it. Next to the station wagon is a sign reading "WELCOME TO ASPEN"]
They proceed into town, a tourist mecca, passing all sorts of high-priced tony stores. The scene freezes, and the new title comes up: "South Park in Aspen", then the scene continues. The adults are in happy awe as a woman walks by with her two poodles in front of a jewelry store. The next shot is of the four boys looking out marveling at the sights. They pass a man snorting cocaine in plain view in front of Bernie's. Next shot is of a resort in which a skier finishes his ski run. The entrance is shown: "Aspen Heaven: A Time-Share Community." The station wagon stops in front of a condominium complex and everyone gets out, making their way to the entrance. Fade out.
Fade in, next morning. The adults sit around a coffee table while the kids sit at the dining table eating breakfast behind them. The adults are getting dressed for the day.
Sheila
Oh, this is gonna be so much fun; I haven't skied in years!
Stephen
Where are Butters and Eric?
Stan
They're still asleep.
Stephen
Butters? Eric? Come on! We gotta get to the powder! [a knock on the door, and Linda rises to answer it. Two men enter]
Phil
[brunet] Hello, folks, I'm Phil and this is Josh [a blond]. We're with the Aspen Time-Share Company. [the other parents gather 'round]
The Parents
Hello.
Josh
You folks enjoying the condo?
Sheila
It's lovely. Thank you.
The dining table.
Cartman
You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
Stan
What's a Hitler?
Cartman
You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
Stan
No, I never have.
Cartman
Shh-shh, here he comes.
Butters
Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?! [Cartman starts laughing] A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
Cartman
[knowingly] Nothing, Butters. Right, guys?!
The front door.
Phil
Well, we can't wait to show you what Aspen Time-Share is offering investors. Shall we do our thirty-minute meeting?
Randy
Oh, do we have to do it right now?
Josh
Well, best to do it and get it out of the way.
Stephen
Okay. [Phil and Josh leave, Sheila steps forward, and the adults begin to exit]
Sheila
Boys, we have to go to this time-share presentation real quick, but you go meet your ski instructor on the bunny hill.
The Boys
Okay.
Stephen
We'll meet you boys on the slopes. [exits and closes the door]
Butters
Hey, do you guys smell that?
Stan
Smell what?
Butters
Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. [Cartman chuckles]
Cartman
I don't smell anything. Do you guys? [bursts out laughing. Stan and Kyle just look at him as Butters looks up, wondering...]
Music fades in. Exterior shots of the resort are shown .The bunny slope is shown. Lifts go up and down as kids practice skiing moves. The four boys and Ike are shown waiting for their instructor.
Butters
Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
Cartman
Yeah, well, that's why they call it Asspen. [laughs at his cleverness. A skier skis up to them]
Thumper
All right, little dudes, [sets his skis aside] great to see you out here. My name is Thumper, and I'm gonna be your cool ski instructor. [gives the boys two thumbs up]
Cartman
[to Stan] His name is Thumper?
Thumper
We're gonna take it slow, take it easy, make sure everybody has a goood time. 'Cause what is skiing about? Having a good...? [puts his left hand to his ear, hoping for an answer. The boys just look at him] Time, that's right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you're gonna fall, you're gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time.
Butters
So where's the part where we have a good time?
Thumper
Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here. [motions to the nose, where Butters does indeed have crap]
Butters
Wuh, that's my face, sir.
Thumper
Alright, we're gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together [he puts his indices and thumbs together; front ski tips touch], in the shape of a slice of pizza. Then to go faster, we put 'em parallel, like... French fries. [begins to drift forward] You see that? [wedges the skis] Pizza, [lines up the skis] French fries, [wedges the skis] Pizza, [lines up the skis] French fries. [moves farther away each time]
Butters
Ah-hey, this is gonna be just like eatin' at Shakey's, huh fellas?
Thumper
Okay, let's have the little dude at the end try first! What's your name?
Ike
Iiiiike!
Thumper
Okay, Mike, ski down to me! [Ike looks down the hill, but doesn't move]
Kyle
Go on, Ike.
Ike
[begins to practice the positions] Pee-za, Fron fries. Pee-za, Fron fries. Fron friiiies. [skis out of control] Peeee-zaaa [skis for a lodge and right through its wall.]
Thumper
Okay, you see what he did?! He French-fried when he should've pizza'd. You French-fry when you pizza, you're gonna have a bad time!
The meeting, meanwhile. Phil and Josh are presenting the time-share plan.
Phil
And so, we think we can convince you to buy one of our combos that's opening right here in Phase 4.
Josh
That sounds like a GREAT investment opportunity!
Gerald
I-I'm sorry, but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo.
Randy
Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.
Phil
Oh, I know, that's what everybody says - "Not me, I can't afford it." But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars!
Josh
Wow!
Sheila
For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?
Phil
Well you see, "time-share" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves [exits screen left and immediately enters screen right] You [puts his hands together] "share" the condo with other investors and pick the [points to his watch] "time" you want to stay.
Josh
[makes a fist with his right hand] Share, [makes a fist with his left hand] time. [joins his fists together] Time share.
Randy
So then it's not really ours.
Phil
Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, "I've got a little place in Aspen."
Josh
Try it. Try saying it. "I've got a little place in Aspen."
The Parents
I've got a little place in Aspen.
Phil
Rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? Say guys, how'd you like to tell that hot secretary "I've got a nice little place in Aspen?" Hahaha! Just kidding, wives.
Randy
[looks at his watch] Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?
Phil
Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend.
Gerald
Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.
Phil
Right, but this isn't that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting. [the parents just look at him] Don't worry, you're gonna have a great free meal at the luncheon.
Bunny slope, later.
Kyle
[practicing his moves] ...French fries... pizza... french fries... [does the pizza moves and sees Cartman fallen on his back] come on, Cartman.
Cartman
Ugh, no more., [Kyle skis on. Stan is skiing as well, and another skier comes up to him, showering him with snow]
Tad
Looks like you think you're a pretty good skier, huh, kid?
Stan
Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
Tad
I've been skiing for twenty-two years. Think you could beat me?
Stan
Uhh... no.
Tad
What's your name, hot shot? [two of his friends join him]
Stan
Stan. Marsh.
Tad
Stan Marsh [laughs] Stan DARSH is more like it.
Skier
Haaaa, Darsh! [his pole is slapped by the first skier's]
Tad
Alright, how about a race, then? You and me.
Stan
Dude, I'm just learning.
Tad
OooooOOOOooo! [starts moving and squawking like a chicken, ending up facing Stan] Looks to me like you're not a "hot shot" after all.
Stan
I never said I was.
Tad
Oooooooo!
Tad's friends
Oooooooo!
Tad
You may think you've got what it takes, but as long as I'm around, you'll always be number two! [the two other skiers left] See ya later, Darsh! [laughs, kicks some snow into Stan's face, and skis away]
The meeting at Aspen Heaven, later. Phil and Josh are still extolling the time-share plan.
Phil
And THAT is why owning a piece of an Aspen condo is not only possible,...
Josh
It's downright smart!
Gerald
Aha. [waiters come in with platters of food]
Phil
Op, here it is! As promised, a fabulous free lunch!
Gerald
Wow, filet mignon' and lobster!
Sharon
[appreciatively] Not bad. [Sheila and the others begin to eat]
Josh
It's nice to feel rich, isn't it.
Sheila
Oh, you know, this is really great.
Stephen
It sure is. [the waiters whisk the plates away]
Randy, Gerald
What?
Randy
Wait...
Phil
You see? That's the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can't afford.
Josh
And then share it with the people that come tomorrow.
Randy
All right, look, we've been here for over three hours.
Gerald
Yeah. Can we go now, please?
Phil
Of course you can. Go hit those slopes! [softly] If you could just please show me the backs of your table place cards real quick? [the others pick up their cards and look] Oh my God! You got the red sticker!
Josh
They got the red sticker?!
Phil
They got the red sticker!
Stephen
What's the red sticker?
Josh
Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you'll receive one of three great prizes.
Randy
No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.
Phil
Okay, okay, fine, I mean... [his voice gradually drops to a whisper] It would only take a second, but, I mean, you know, what did we do for you except, give you a free condo for the weekend. Huh. Seems like you could just... could just come up... and see what prize you had... [Josh begins to cry]
Stephen
O-all right!
The bunny slope, even later. Kyle and Stan are skiing down faster now, mastering the basic pizza-French fries technique.
Stan
...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
Kyle
...french fries...pizza...pizza...pizza-french fries...[loses control and jerks forward, then flips over and lands next to Ike, who's half-buried in the snow. Kyle looks over and gets up quickly. He dusts himself off as Stan catches up] I wonder where our parents are.
Stan
Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
Tad
[arrives, with his friends close behind] Well well well, if it isn't Stan Darsh!
Stan
[winces and covers his face with his right hand] Oh no.
Tad
Say Darsh, you don't mind if I take Heather out for some fondue tonight, do ya?
Stan
Heather? [a woman skis up and stands next to the skier]
Heather
Sorry, Stan, it's just that when it comes to skiing, Tad has all the right moves.
Tad
I just might show her my moves tonight, if you know what I mean. [giggles]
Heather
You aren't mad, are you, Stan? I mean, a girl's gotta look out for her best interests.
Stan
[just looks at them] ...who are you people?!
Tad
Still don't wanna race me? I told you he was chicken, Heather. Stan Marsh the Darsh! [laughs disdainfully]
Stan
All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
Tad and friends
Oooooooo!
Tad
Alright, fine. You and me at the summit, now!
Stan
Okay.
Tad's friends
Race! Race!
Ski run, moments later. A view from the bottom shows a long run, and the resort's main buildings off to the right near the finish line.
Announcer
Ladies and Gentlemen, Aspen Mountain presents another ex-TREME racing showdown. [the gathering crowd cheers] Seven-time World Aspen champion Tad Mikowski versus eight-year-old Stan Marsh!
Tad
Hah! You're going down, little boy!
Stan
Yeah, prob'ly.
Butters
Do you think Stan has a chance? [the countdown begins. The chutes open and Tad takes off. Stan moves along allowing, sticking to the basic moves] Uh go Stan! [Tad flies down the hill, banking and weaving throughout. Stan appears a few seconds later, going down carefully]
Stan
Fries... fries...
A skier
[Tad zooms past him] He's got it! Tad's gonna win it! [as the crowd cheers, Tad clears the last few hills and then goes through the finish line. He comes to a stop and people gather around him]
Tad
[raising his arms in victory] Yeah! Yeeah! Yeah! You lose, Darsh! [kisses Heather, who reacts. They lock lips. Stan finally crosses the finish line, in the wedge position] Yeah! [Butters, Kyle and Ike walk up to Stan]
Butters
U-u-uh, Stan, yo-you gave it your best shot, and that all Jesus asks of you.
Stan
[drops his poles] Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. [a group of young adults walk by carrying Tad high in the air. The group stops, the boys turn around to see]
Tad
[looking down at Stan] No hard feelings, right Darsh?! [starts laughing.. The group moves away. The boys turn left as their eyes follow the group] Yeah!
Teen Girl
Stan, [the boys turn to see her] for what it's worth, I think you were really brave.
Stan
Thanks. Who are you?
Teen Girl
Hey, all the cool teens are gonna be at the youth center tonight for a dance. I hope you'll come because you're just so... we-hell, you're just so.. well, that's all. [turns around and walks off]
The valley, day. There are three long lines of people waiting to ski. The parents finally make it out of the meeting.
Gerald
Finally, we get to go skiing!
Randy
Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.
Gerald
Yeah, I guess these passes the time-share salesman gave us will come in handy.
Lift Operator
Can I help you?
Stephen
Yes, we have the special passes to use the exclusive lift from the time-share company?
Lift Operator
Ooooh, go right on ahead, folks.
Sheila
Thank you. [the parents move forward and position themsleves for the lift, which comes down presently. The parents get on and the lift goes up the slope again]
Randy
Well, this certainly is nice.
Gerald
Yeah, we may not have gotten to ski earlier, but with this lift we'll get more runs in than anybody.
Stephen
Have fun waiting in line, suckers! Woohoohoo!
Linda
Oh, Chris. [Randy giggles, then looks up]
Stephen
Hey look, this chair lift goes right into a building. [the lift turns, drops them off, and moves back out.]
Aspen Heaven meeting room, again.
Phil
Welcome back, folks!
Josh
We've got a special offer we can't wait to tell you about!
Randy
Oh, God-damnit!
Aspen Youth Center. Teens enter from all sides. The boys go in as well.
Kyle
Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
Aspen Youth Center, inside. The boys find themselves on a dance floor listening to a live band.
Teen Girl
I'm glad you guys came. Do you like our youth center?
Stan
It seems fine.
Voguing Skier
Yeah, too bad we're getting shut down. That hot-shot skier Tad's father is gonna bulldoze the building.
Voguing Skier 2
Where are all us kids supposed to go?
Stan
Don't care. [the boys go further onto the dance floor]
Kyle
What do you wanna do now?
Stan
I dunno.
Butters
Let's dance. [begins to dance. Cartman watches with dismay. Butters does a bunch of dance moves, including the Moonwalk and some break-dancing]
Cartman
Butters, I hate you with every inch of my body. [the music is stopped and a voice is heard]
Announcer
Alright, Aspen-heh. As a special treat tonight we're proud to have the winner of today's race, Tad Mikowski. [moves off and the crowd begins to cheer as Tad approaches the mic]
Tad
Yeah!
Stan
Oh,. God. [buries his face in his hand again.]
Tad
Hey everyone. [the crowd quiets down] I'd like to sing a little song, if I may.
The Ladies
[swooning] Ooooooooo.
Stan
Gah, let's go you guys. [turns around and leads the others towards the door...]
Tad
This is a song I wrote about... Stan Marsh. [Stan stops in his tracks]
Staaaaan... Daaaaarsh...
Stan. Darsh. Darshy Daaarsh
Stan Daaarsh
Stan Darsh, Stan-darsh
Stan Daaaaarsh Daaarsh
Stan Darsh...
Stan
Dude, what the hell is your problem?!
Tad and friends
OooOOOOOOoooooo!
Stan
I raced you, You won!
Tad
A rematch? Oh, Darsh. You're even dumber than I thought.
Teen Boy
He'll ski you anytime, anywhere!
Teens
Yeah!
Teen Girl
[talking to Tad, referring to Stan] But this time, if he wins, you get your dad to not close our youth center.
Stan
What?
Tad
Alright then, let's make it interesting. Tomorrow afternoon. On the K-13. [points at a window. The camera pans to the window, and a lone huge peak is shown. Two teens look and are horrified]
A Teen Boy
[steps into view] The K-13? But that's the most dangerous run in all of America. [steps away]
Tad
Hell, I'm not chicken! Are you, Darsh?! [starts squawking like a chicken]
Stan
I'll be there, you queen!
Tad
Oh, yeah?!
Stan
Yeah!
Tad
Oh, Darsh, you're even dumber than I thought... Again! See ya tomorrow.
The Youth Center, outside. The boys exit the center.
Butters
Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
Stan
Dude, I have to!
Kyle
[shoves Stan a bit and faces him] Stan, you can't let that Tad guy get to you. Screw him, dude.
Stan
Dude, he's got Heather!
Kyle
You don't even know Heather!
Stan
I know I know I-, ugh. Look I can't explain it but I have to do this. I'm not gonna die. I mean, how bad can the K-13 be?
Mechanic
[appears out of nowhere] The K-13? You don't wanna go down that run. That run has got a history. Thirty-five people have died goin' down it, and some say you can still see their ghosts up there. It was on that very ski run that a group of students were killed by a wolf-boy who escaped from a mental institution. You see, that ski run was once a burial ground to a tribe of vampire Wichicaw Indians who ate the flesh of children with no eyes. Yah-, a lot of history on that ski run. [the boys just look at him]
Stan
...Thank you.
Mechanic
Yah. [moves off]
Kyle
Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
Stan
This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
Aspen Heaven, next day. The parents are still meeting with Phil and Josh.
Phil
...And so you see it's the investment opportunity that keeps on giving.
Gerald
How many times do we have to tell you this? We don't want to buy shares in a condo!
Josh
And we certainly don't want to pressure you.
Gerald
Pressure us?! You kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back!
Phil
Heh-ey, you can leave anytime you want. Of course, that is, if you don't want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show.
Randy
[Rises from his chair angrily] No, we don't want the super-secret fun prize alright?! We just wanna ski! Come on, everybody! [leads the others towards the door]
Josh
I know! Have you ever considered going in on a time share?
Phil
That's only a couple thousand each, Josh!
Randy
Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!
Aspen Heaven, the hallway. The parents walk down the hall.
Gerald
My God, can you believe those people?!
Stephen
I hope you don't blame me for all that. I mean, the ad ...did... just say a thirty-minute presentation.
Randy
Let's just get out of here. [opens a door across the hall. The parents find themselves in a room exactly like the one they left across the hall]
Phil
Folks, I'm glad you're back, because we forgot to mention, time-share condos are still deeded properties!
Parents
Aaagh!! [they turn around and walk out... er, in]
Phil
Oooo, you folks really lucked out this time. You're visitor number one thousand!
Josh
That means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only!
Randy
That does it! I'm calling the police! [takes out the cell phone and begins dialing. One of the salesmen groans softly]
Bunny slope, day. Beginners practice their moves. A girl stands next to Thumper; he sets her up and sends her on her way.
Stan
[approaches] Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
Thumper
K-13?! But you're just a beginner! You ski outta your league, you're gonna have a bad time.
Stan
I have to do this, okay? I have to!
Thumper
Alright, well, if you gotta get good at somethin' really fast, there's only one way to do it. Come on!
A song begins to play. Thumper is giving Stan some quick instructions and then Stan starts skiing. Thumper looks on, encouraging.
Singer (and backup singers)
The day is approaching to give it your best
You've got to reach your prime!

[Thumper and Stan do some Tai Chi on their skis, then Thumper has Stan ski down the hill blindfolded while he takes notes on technique and time]

That's when you need to put yourself to the test
And show us the passage of time
We're gonna need a montage (Montage)
A sports-training montage (Montage)

[The teen girl is reading to Stan from a book: Skiing for "DUMBASSES." Then Thumper spots Stan as Stan does barbells, then has him do a few more runs. The times aren't satisfactory.]

And just show a lot of things happenin' at once.
Remind everyone of what's goin' on. (What's goin' on?)

[Bulldozers show up at the youth center to knock it down, but a group of families shows up to protest the demolition. Next shot, the parents are still at those meeting, getting quite weary and tired]

And with every shot, show a little improvement
To show it won't take too long
That's called a montage (Montage)
Even Rocky had a montage (Montage)

[Stan skis down a little faster, and Thumper shows him how much he's improved. Tad is then shown polishing his skills, landing after a ski jump and receiving Heather into his arms. The girl reads to Stan some more, but Stan's fallen asleep. She rouses him and resumes the lesson]

In any sport, if you want to go
From just a beginner to a pro
You'll need a montage (Montage)
a simple little montage (Montage)

[she shows Stan a few pictures in her book. Next, Stan is skiing down the hill with bricks weighing his shoulders down. Kyle stands on a bluff with a picture of himself and Stan and looks wistfully at it and at K-13. Cartman rubs his finger into his ass and gives a sleeping Butters the Hitler again. Cartman stifles a laugh]

Always fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)

[Again, Stan skis down the hill with Thumper looking on. Now Thumper approves of the time. The instructor, the teen girl, and Stan look out at K-13 from a nearby hill, the camera at their backs]

If you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)
Montage (Montage)

[The camera faces the trio now and zooms out slowly. Stan sets his skis down and steps into them, then skis down the slope. Fade out]

Aspen Heaven meeting room, day. Two officers are present with the two salesmen and the six parents.
Randy
All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!
Phil
That's not true, officers, we said they could leave at any time.
Thin Cop
All right, let me see if I got this straight. You two gentlemen are offering part-time limited liability [suddenly animated] ownership in one of your fabulous condos for the one-time price of eight thousand dollars?!
Phil
That's right!
Fat Cop
Sounds to me like if anybody should be arrested it should be you people for passin' up such a great deal!
Thin Cop
That's right, you're practically stealing condos at that price. "Book 'em, Danno!" [laughs. The parents look on, chagrined]
Randy
Oh, Jesus.
Linda
No! No!
Gerald
The police work for time-share, too? [the police draw their guns and aim at the parents]
Phil
[somewhat menacing, moves forward] The police, the mayor, the president of the United States. Perhaps now you see the severity of your situation. I think we shall all sit down... [backs up] and listen to the presentation.
Josh
[draws his own gun and aims] Sit! [the parents go to the table and sit on the chair]
Phil
Now, you're probably asking yourselves... "Can my time-share condo turn into a profit?"
Josh
"What kind of cash flow can I realize from my investment?"
Phil
The answer might astonish you. For over ten years investors have seen their-
Aspen Heaven ski run, finish line area, day.
Announcer
The powder is fresh and the stage is set for Tad versus Stan on the K-13!
K-13 peak. Tad and Stan are ready to ski.
Tad
This time you're not just gonna lose, you're gonna die!
Finish line area. The other boys and Ike are present, with their instructor behind them.
Kyle
I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. [Cartman gives him an angry look]
Announcer
Ready. Set. Go! [the crowd cheers and Tad takes off. Stan begins to ski]
Stan
Pizza... pizza... pizza...
Man In Yellow Jacket
Tad's got the lead.
Butters
Come on, Stan! [Tad is shown zipping down the hill, Stan is still at the summit making his way down]
Tad
[stops near a tree] Haha. [pulls out a small saw hidden in the back side of his jacket] This should slow down Darsh a bit! [goes to the tree and starts sawing it off at the base. Stan has gone down the mountain some more]
Announcer
[the crowd cheers the skiers on] And it looks like Tad is way out in front.
Tad
[finishes sawing the tree in two and laughs] Now, I'll win for sure!
Kyle
Awgh, dude, I can't look. [closes his eyes and covers them with his hands Tad is shown zipping further down the hill, Stan has left the summit]
Tad
[stops and looks up the hill, then leaves. He returns with a bucket of sand and pours it out]
Let's see what some sand does to your speed, Darsh! [leaves. Stan continues his run. Tad returns with more sand and pours it out]
He doesn't stand a chance, now! [Stan reaches the fallen tree and climbs over it, then continues his run. Tad pours out even more sand]
I'm gonna beat 'em! [tosses the bucket away and leaves]
Announcer
[as the crowd cheers] The race is half over and Tad is still out in the lead! [Stan is moving along nicely. Tad stops further down and pushes a large cage of hamsters onto the slope]
Tad
Heh, when Darsh skis by here, I'll let all these hamsters go. That should distract him just long enough for me to win the race!
Teen Girl
[walks in] Oh, Tad.
Tad
...What are you doing up here?
Teen Girl
Oh nothing. I just thought I could distract you. With these. [lifts up her jacket and top. Tad look and is unable to move as he groans at what he sees. Stan moves along in the background and passes Tad, who remains spellbound. Stan reaches the finish line and breaks it. The boys and the crowd cheer the victory and approach Stan. Another song begins to play]
Kyle
Good job, dude!
Stan
Thanks. [Tad reaches the finish line to see the celebration start without him. He takes off his goggles and throws them to the ground in anger]
Announcer
You did it, Stan! [Tad approaches Heather, who gives him the cold shoulder and walks away. Tad is crestfallen]
Teen Girl
Thanks a lot, Stan. Now we're gonna be able to keep the youth center. [the crowd cheers louder, and the mechanic stops by]
Mechanic
Well, that does it. Looks like the spirits of the Wakichaw Indians can finally rest in peace. [three spirits rise from K-13 thanking Stan for setting them free.]
Heather
[walks up to Stan] Stan, I was wrong about you. Would you like to go out again? [Stan looks at her incredulously]
Teen Girl
Go ahead, Stan. She's everything you ever wanted. [the parents arrive]
Sheila
There you are, boys!
Kyle
Mom, Dad!
Stan
Where the hell have you guys been?!
Stephen
Uh, we got a little held up at the time-share sales office.
Randy
Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
The Boys
[disappointed] Awwwwww!
Stephen
What's the matter? Didn't you boys like skiing? [the song is stopped abruptly]
Stan
No! We can't keep track of when you pizza and when you French-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if you're supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girl's youth center. Skiing sucks! [turns right and leads the other boys away]
Kyle
Yeah, what a stupid sport! [the parents turn left and follow the boys away]
Thumper
[looks at the teen girl] I heard that you were the one responsible for making Tad lose the race. Thanks.
Teen Girl
Yeah. Well he really flipped when he saw these. [lifts up her jacket and top again and two creatures appear where her breasts should be]
Left Creature
[softly, slowly] Quaid...
Right Creature
[softly, slowly] Start the reactor...
End of Asspen

Freak Strike
Commercial.
Announcer
Today on the Maury Povich show, these poor unfortunate people [a shot of one dwarf walking, then of another being interviewed by Maury] all have horrible disfigurements, [a shot of a man with elephantitis getting some popcorn, then going down an escalator] and you won't believe how we exploit them for your amusement! [Maury interviews a flatheaded man, a blond with stumps for arms wrestles with a brush in the shower]
Stan's house, living room. He, Kyle, and Cartman watch television from the sofa.
Stan
Hm, that sounds pretty good.
"Kenny"
[walks in] (Hey guys. What's going on here?)
Stan
Hey Kenny! [the three boys grin]
"Kenny"
(Gosh darn it, my name's not Kenny!)
Cartman
That's awesome, Kenny. ["Kenny" removes his hood, and it's Butters]
Butters
Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
Kyle
Okay, Not-Kenny.
Butters
And I'm not gonna wear this coat anymore, neither! [takes off the coat and tosses it away] I should be able to be you guys' friend without wearin' Kenny's old coat!
Stan
Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povich freak show is on.
Butters
Oh, all right, then. [takes a seat on the sofa between Kyle and Cartman]
Maury Povich show.
Maury
Our next guest is a little girl who was born without a midsection. Please welcome Damla Jones.
Damla
[a blonde] Hello, Maury. [walks out. She has spindly legs, but no chest, abdomen or back. Think Mike Wazowski of "Monsters Inc." The boys are suitably disgusted]
Cut to Cartman and the boys.
Cartman
Aww, sick dude!
Cut to show.
Maury
[Damla climbs onto the guest chair] You're a very brave little girl, and I'm very proud of you.
Damla
[voice quivering] Thank you.
Maury
[leans forward] Can you tell the audience how miserable your life is?
Damla
Uh-uh, yes. It is.
Maury
[giggles] You're a cutey. Do the other kids at school sometimes make fun of you?
Damla
Sometimes.
Maury
[puts his left hand on her forehead] Do people sometimes stare at you?
Damla
Sometimes.
Maury
[sits on the ground in front of her] Do they go, "Oh, gross. What the hell is that thing"?
Damla
Mmm-I don't know. [looks away and down]
Maury
Well your mommy told us you like to listen to music.
Damla
Yes.
Maury
Well guess what, Damla. We're gonna give you a three hundred dollar gift certificate to CD World in Torrance! [the studio audience applauds, music starts up to lead to commercial] All right, everyone. Stay tuned, because next we're gonna meet a woman whose head was smashed in on a locker! And we're gonna give her a makeover!
Cut to sofa.
Kyle
This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
Cut to show.
Announcer
Do you or someone you know have a disfigurement or disability that we can exploit on the Maury Povich show? If so, call 1-555-HEY MAURY!
Cut to sofa.
Stan
Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
Kyle
Cool!
Cartman
Oh YES!! [gets off the sofa and heads for the phone]
Butters
Oh, that'd be awesome! [Cartman dials the number]
Kyle
[he and the other two follow Cartman] Do you think they'll believe it?
Stan
What disease should we say?
Cartman
Shhh. Be quite, you guys! [talks to someone on the phone] Hello, is this Maury Povich? [beat] Oh, well who the hell are you? [beat] Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks? [Stan grins, Kyle stifles a laugh] Ye-right, people with disabilities? [beat] Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show. [beat] Great! [beat] Hih-his condition? [beat] Uh, he has a condition called "chinballalitis." [beat] Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin. [Stan stilfes a laugh and closes his eyes, then Butters stifles a laugh. All of them giggle. Cartman tells the others] Shut uh- shut up you guys. [beat, then on the phone] Yes. [beat] Yes, of course he's very upset about it. [beat] Yes, he cries all the time. [beat] Miserable, uh huh. [beat] You wha- Really?
Stan
[drops his hands] What? [the others follow]
Cartman
Dude, they say they'll fly him out day after tomorrow!
Kyle
Awesome!
Butters
Cool!
Cartman
Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show. [trying to be subtle] There will of course be a prize involved? [beat] Great. I'll call you back in an hour. [gladly] No, thank you. [hangs up] YES!
Stan
This is gonna be so funny!
Butters
Uh, it sure is!
Kyle
But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
Butters
Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
Kyle
Yeah.
Butters
Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters.
Stan
We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
Butters
We-ell hold on a second, you guys.
Cartman
[hops off the chair] Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crazy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
Butters
Hang on now.
Kyle
Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
Butters
Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
Stan
It has to be you, Butters. Think about it.
Cartman
Yeah.
Butters
But fellas, if I go on Maury Povich, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
Kyle
We'll just tell your parents we're going on a camping trip with my parents. They'll never know.
Butters
I'm sorry, but the answer is uh uh, uh uh, uh uh. [crosses his arms and looks away]
Stan
[looks away and up] Kenny woulda done it. [Butters reacts]
Butters
...So? I told you guys before: [with emphasis] I'm not Kenny.
Kyle
We know. Believe me, we know. We're reminded every day that you're not Kenny because Kenny... was cool.
Cartman
Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.
Stan
[begins to walk and lead the others away] Well, come on guys. If Butters won't even put his balls on his chin for us, I guess we know where we stand. [Butters now looks chastened]
Cartman
Yeah.
Butters
Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
The Trekkers' place down the street, next day. The two Trekkers work on Butters.
Brunet Trekker
Now, we're going to apply the latex with some spirit gum.
Butters
Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.
Stan
Where's you get the balls from?
Brunet Trekker
We made a plastic mold of his chin, and then made a latex scrotum and put two golf balls inside.
Cartman
Nice.
Blond Trekker
Now we just blend the skin tones, add a little hair, [spins the chair around] and presto! [shows Butters' new look to the boys. Butters indeed sports a fake scrotum]
Stan
Wow!
Kyle
That looks awesome!
Butters
Aw, I feel silly.
Cartman
They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
Blond Trekker
I believe you owe us payment now? [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
Stan
All right, the original AVID cut of Star Wars: Episode I
Brunet Trekker
Wooww!
Blond Trekker
They weren't lying!
The Trekkers' place. The boys leave the room.
Kyle
[softly] Why the hell would they want that anyway? [drops to a whisper] Episode I sucked balls.
Cartman
Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. [the Trekkers begin to fight over the tape. Butters checks his new balls self-consciously]
Blond Trekker
Here, damnit!
Brunet Trekker
Hey, hey! Stop it, man!
Denver Airport, next day.
Announcer
Gay Air Flight 243 with service to New York now ready for general boarding.
Stan
That's your flight, Butters.
Cartman
Okay, here's your ticket [hands it to Butters] and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. [pushes him forward]
Butters
Uh wait. [stops] You guys aren't comin' with me?
Stan
Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
Butters
[backs up into the lineup] Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
Cartman
God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
Kyle
Yeah, he sure is.
Stan
Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! [pause]
Cartman
Buh-ters! Buh-ters!
Butters
[hesitant] Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. [heads for the gate, then turns around. The boys wave at him. Butters looks down, then walks into the plane.]
New York, TV Studio, day.
Stagehand
Thanks for coming on the show, kid. Maury is very excited to meet you. And this is the Green Room where you can hang out with the other guests until we call for you on set. Boy with Balls on Chin, meet Man with Foot on Head, Girl with Rapid Aging Disease, Disfigured Country Singer, and Man With No Face.
Butters
Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
Man With No Face
[goes for some water] Yes, this is my sixth appearance. [drinks]
Stagehand
I'll come back in a bit, folks. [leaves]
Man with Foot on Head
Hey Roger! [the stagehand stops] What the hell is with these horrible veggie platters?!
Disfigured Country Singer
Yeah, we told you last time we want fresher vegetables.
Roger
I'm sorry, this is what the studio provides. Just take a seat on the couch, kid. I'll be back in a minute. [Butters looks at the others, then makes his way to a spot on the couch and sits down. A long silence follows]
Disfigured Country Singer
...Boy with balls on his chin. Haven't seen you around. How long have you been on the circuit?
Butters
What circuit?
Man with Foot on Head
The talk-show circuit. Don't tell us this is your first one.
Butters
Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
Man With No Face
Oprah two times, Jenny Jones once, Sally Jessie five times.
Disfigured Country Singer
[looks at the man with no face] You've only done Jenny once?
Man with Foot on Head
Oh, ah I hate doing the Jenny Jones show. They don't even have their own hair people.
Man With No Limbs
I'm doing Jenny tomorrow.
Disfigured Country Singer
Yeah, you picked a good show to do first, kid, but you need to learn the ropes. There are a lot of people like you all over the country, and we all do talk shows for a living.
Man with Foot on Head
We all know each other and we kinda stick together to make sure our industry is protected.
Man With No Face
Yeah. Like when someone LIES about being a freak.
Butters
[trembling] Oh they, they do, huh?
Disfigured Country Singer
Yeah, they'll make up a fake condition to go on these shows and then take our money away!
Man With No Limbs
We don't take kindly to that.
Butters
Well I can certainly see why.
Man With No Limbs
It's okay. Folks don't do it anymore. Not after what they saw what we did to Lobster Boy.
Butters
Lobster Boy?
Man with Foot on Head
Yeah, loh-, Lobster Boy used to make appearances on all the talk shows. He was one of the most popular disfigured people on TV.
Disfigured Country Singer
But then we all found out that Lobster Boy wasn't a real freak at all. He was just an actual lobster.
Man With No Limbs
[grousing] Lying sack of crap.
Man with Foot on Head
So you know what we did to him?
Butters
What?
Man with Foot on Head
One night all us freaks got together, and we... boiled him alive. [Butters stares, then an image of a lobster in a boiling pot appears, then vanishes]
Disfigured Country Singer
Now Lobster Boy is no more.
Butters
Oh. Yeah. I I hate when people fake conditions, too. Those stupid fakers.
Man with Foot on Head
We're glad you agree.
Stagehand
Okay, Boy with balls on his chin, you're up next.
Butters
[hops off the couch and heads for the door.] Oh, Jesus, see me through this.
Maury Povich Show promo.
Announcer
Next on the Maury Povich show: we bring back some of our favorite disfigured people [four scenes: first, the man with the foot on his head is talking to the girl with rapid aging disease and disfigured country singer, then the disfigured country singer is shown eating a subway sub, then the man with no face shows his disfigurement, and finally Butters' shadow is shown in profile] and introduce you to some new ones.
Stan's living room. The boys watch TV..
Stan
Here he comes.
Kyle
This is gonna be awesome!
Maury Povich Show, new segment.
Maury
Our next guest suffers from a rare birth defect which caused his testicles and scrotum to grow from his chin.
Cartman
Testicles and scrotum! [laughs gleefully]
Maury
Please welcome eight-and-a-half-year old Napoleon Bonaparte from South Park Colorado. [Butters looks out timidly at the audience from behind the curtain, then heads for the guest chair.] Thanks so much for coming on our show.
Butters
Huh, that's okay, I, I s'pose.
Maury
So, is it tough being ...different?
Butters
Uhhh, yeah.
Maury
And do all the kids at school make fun of you?
Butters
[forgetting why he's supposedly made of] They sure do. They always say to me, "Butters, you're not Kenny." But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
Cartman
Uh oh, we're losin' him.
Butters
I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
Maury
Uh, yeah, but I mean, do the kids make fun of you because of your condition?
Butters
Uh what condition?
Maury
[terse] You have balls that hang off your chin.
Butters
I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
Stan, Kyle
Phew.
Cartman
Oh, that was close.
Maury
What names do they call you at school?
Butters
Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, "Hey, there goes Chinballs!" [Stan and Kyle grin, Cartman laughs hard]
Maury
And do they call you "freak" and "weirdo"?
Butters
Well yeah, I s'pose.
Maury
[sits on the floor and draws closer] Do they point at you and laugh? Do they make you wish you'd never been born? Make you wish to put an end to the whole... miserable wretched earth?
Butters
Uh, sure.
Maury
Well Napoleon, we have a surprise for you.
Stan, Kyle
Wait, here it is, here it is!
Cartman
The present.
Maury
Because you're such a brave little chinballed man, we're gonna send you directly from this studio to the world's largest putt-putt golf course in the world!
Butters
Oh really?
Kyle
Wow!
Cartman
Did he say "the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world"?
Maury
Go on, you're going right now!! [Butters hops off and walks away happily]
Stan
But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
Kyle
Yeah! We thought of the whole thing!
Cartman
Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
Cartman's room, later that day. Cartman is on the phone.
Cartman
Hello, is this the Maury Povich show? [beat] Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin. [strokes his "balls"] I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?
Operator
[just painted the fingernails on her right hand and is having them dry] I'm sorry, but we're done doing freak shows for now. We're looking for people for a new topic.
Cartman
What's the new topic?
Operator
Please help my out-of-control child.
Cartman
Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!
Operator
Really? [pulls out a notepad and starts taking notes] Is your mother in tears every day over how disobedient you are?
Cartman
Uh, sure!
Operator
Does she worry about you doing drugs and having sex at such a young age?
Cartman
Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and potpourri, and queazies.
Operator
Well that's great! If you can get your mom to come in with you, we'd love to fly you out.
Cartman
[stunned] ...my, my mom?
Cartman's home, kitchen. His mom is humming and preparing gingerbread men for baking. Cartman enters with his hands clasped behind his back.
Cartman
Mmoooomm?
Liane
Yes, sweetie?
Cartman
Could you do me a favor?
Liane
What's that, my little man?
Cartman
Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt golf course in the wwoooorrlldd?
Liane
Hmmm. but you're not out of control, muffin. You're my perfect little gum drop.
Cartman
I'm just asking you to lie for me. You love me, don't you?
Liane
Of course I do.
Cartman
Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
Liane
Sweetie, don't.
Cartman
Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother. [turns around and walks out] Such a beautiful mother.
Butters' house. He's back from New York and his parents have apparently heard about the show. Stephen has his arms folded in front of him.
Linda
Just what did you think you were doing, Butters? Not only did you lie to us and say you were on a camping trip with Kyle's family, you made a fool of yourself AND us on national television!
Butters
[still wearing his balls, looking hurt] Oh I'm sorry, mom.
Stephen
Well, sorry isn't gonna make it this time, mister! You know, your grandmother saw the show and had a mild stroke!
Butters
Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
Stephen
Ugh! You'd better believe you won't, buster!
Linda
Your father and I have to leave now to visit Grandma in the hospital, but you can just take those balls off your chin and march right up to your room!
Butters
[with voice trembling, turns around] Yes ma'am. [removes his balls]
Butters' room. He's pacing the floor mad at himself.
Butters
Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? [his phone rings. Butters goes for the receiver]
Stan
[on the other end] Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
Butters
Oh Jesus! They were??
Stan
Yeah, they wanted to find you bad.
Butters
Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?
Stan
I- told them where to find you.
Butters
What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
Stan
Oh. Well, serves you right for screwing us over. [hangs up. Butters looks helpless, then walks to the window to see if the freaks are coming. They are indeed]
Butters
Oh Jesus no. [hops off his dresser and walks away from the window] They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here! [reaches his bedroom door, but turns around] Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! [the doorbell rings.]
Butters' house, out front. A scream is heard and the freaks look around.
Man with Foot on Head
Napoleon? [the disfigured country singer goes for the knob and opens the door.]
Disfigured Country Singer
Napoleon Bonaparte? [leads the other freaks in. Butters quickly prepares his false scrotum...] I think he's up here. [opens the door, and Butters grins back at them with one hand on the dresser and a suave pose. His balls are back in place]
Butters
Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?
Disfigured Country Singer
There you are, Boy With Balls On His Chin.
Man with Foot on Head
We've got big news! The union is striking.
Butters
[relaxes] The union? Oh, that's why you came?
Disfigured Country Singer
We're tired of our crappy prizes! So the union president, Man with Terrible Skin Condition, has told us to round everyone up.
Butters
Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
Man with Foot on Head
Grounded for what?
Butters
For havin' balls on my- AH! Ah, I mean, nothin'. [strikes the pose again] Ah I'm not grounded.
Man With No Face
Good, then you can march with us. Freaks of the world,
The Freaks
Unite! [Butters looks at them]
Maury Povich show.
Announcer
Today on Maury Povich: These moms [three are shown. Only Liane grins] don't know what to do with their out-of-control kids! [a fat blonde girl is shown, then Cartman's school picture] Young boys and girls so whorish on our show that it borders on child pornography!
Maury
[on his stool] We're here talking with moms who think their children are out of control. [the woman next to him blows her nose] Vanessa here says that her thirteen-year-old daughter Vanity is already doing drugs and having sex with older men. [Vanessa begins to bawl]
Studio Audience
Ooohhhhhhhh.
Maury
Vanessa, what does Vanity say to you when you tell her toooo... do her homework.
Vanessa
[sobbing] She says she hates me. She, she calls me "retard"? And, she says my cooch is all dried up and nobody wants it. [sobs some more]
Studio Audience
Aawwwwww. [music starts up]
Maury
Well, let's bring her out. Here's Vanity! [she steps out and the awws turn into boos]
Vanity
Wha'evah, wha'evah! You fuckin' cocksuckers don't know shit! Fuck you! [moons the audience, and an OOPS! bubble appears over the area. Vanity then walks up to her mom and slaps her hard across the face. Vanessa winces in pain]
Maury
Wow, Vanity, you are really an out of control teen.
Some audience members
Yeah! [the rest cheer, then a chant rises from the din] Maury! Maury!
Vanity
Wha'evah! Maury, my mom don't know shit! You could aks her! I aks her all my homies that they be down wit it. You know, it's all good shit. [the audience boos and she holds up her middle fingers, which are blurred] Fuck you, cocksuckuhs!
Green room. Cartman and his mom watch the show in there.
Cartman
Jeez, that girl is pissed off.
Stagehand
[enters] Okay, Cartman family, you're on in two minutes. [leaves]
On stage.
Vanessa
[weeping] Why can't you just listen to me and love me [Vanity slaps her] Ow!
Vanity
Shu' up! Shut the fuck [slap] up, you dried-up skank! [slap. Vanessa weeps again]
Green room. Cartman and his mom watch the show in there.
Liane
I'm glad you're not like that, poopsie-kins.
Cartman
[under his breath] But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize. [leaves the room and finds the stagehand] Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
Stagehand
Second door on the right.
Outside the building, the freaks have gathered and are now on strike - "FREAK OUT 2K2".
The Freaks
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
Brothers and sisters, the time has come for us to be treated with the respect we deserve! We are a strong and diverse group of people, with members like [shown] Woman with Crablike Body, [shown] Incredibly Obese Black Person, [shown] Man with Brains Outside of Head, and [shown] Liza Minnelli. The talk shows have us on and give us little gifts and perks while they make tens of thousands of dollars.
The Freaks
Yeah!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
We told the talk shows our demands, and they laughed! They say they can get plenty of other stupid guests to go on their shows! So we must picket those other guests!
The Freaks
Yeah!
Butters
Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
Hammerhead Man
You're not gonna picket?
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
Who's not gonna picket? [the crowd parts and all hands point to Butters]
Disfigured Country Singer
Boy with Balls on Chin doesn't wanna picket. [lowers his left arm]
Butters
Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
Man with No Limbs
[emerges from the crowd] Why? You're not a SCAB, are you?
Butters
NO I I'm not a scab.
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
Now, we will split up into groups and form picket lines. The first group will be led by: Incredibly Obese Black Man.
Incredibly Obese Black Man
Excuse me, I'm not Incredibly Obese Black Man, I'm Incredibly Black Obese Man.
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
[looks at Incredibly Black Obese Man, then says flatly] ...Oh, right. My bad.
Maury Povich show, back to out-of-control-child segment.
Announcer
And now, back to more kids who are out of control, on the Maury Povich show!
Maury
Our next mother is Liane Cartman. Her son claims to be the most out-of-control kid in the world and says there's nothing his stupid mom can do about it.
Studio Audience
Awww.
Vanessa
Why won't you kids behave? [Vanity stands and smacks her across the face]
Vanity
[shakes her mom around by the neck] Shut up, skank, he's not talkin' to you! [slaps her again and sits down]
Maury
So, Ms. Cartman, you can't control your child?
Liane
Oh, my little poopsie-kins gets into no-nos once in a while, but he's still my perfect little plumsy-kiddle.
Maury
Well, your son made a video backstage. Let's take a look. [a video starts up with Cartman dolled up as a slut moving around to hip-hop music]
Cartman
Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt! [brings out a lollipop] I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
Studio Audience
[gasps, then] BOOOO!!
Liane
Oh, he's such a cutie.
Maury
Well, let's bring him out. Here's Eric Cartman! [steps out from behind the curtain and immediately gives the finger to the audience]
Cartman
Wha'evah! Wha'evah! [walks up to a seat next to his mom's and sits there] Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!
Maury
Ms. Cartman, what does your son like to do?
Liane
Ooo, he loves playing with his Clyde Frog and Wellington Bear.
Cartman
[under his breath] Mom, we're pretending, remember? Sex and drugs.
Liane
Oh, I mean, sex and drugs.
Studio Audience
Oooohhh!
Cartman
[hops off his chair and tries the audience] What-evah! What-evah! [snaps his left-hand fingers back and forth] I'll do what I waunt!
Vanity
Oh, what-evah. You ain't tough, ho! I roam with gangs!
Cartman
Oh yeah?! I roam with twelve gangs! And we only commit hate crimes! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt! [sits back down]
Vanity
What Evah! You ain't bad! You ain't nothin'! I ditch class and go shoot heroin in the school bathroom!
Cartman
What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
Outside the building, the freaks have gathered and are now on strike - "FREAK OUT 2K2".
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
What do we want?
The Freaks
Better prizes!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
When do we want them?
The Freaks
Now!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
What do we want?
The Freaks
Better prizes!
Butters
[muttering along] Better prizes.
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
When do we want them?
The Freaks
Now!
Butters
Never. [approached the Man with Terrible Skin Condition] Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
Napoleon, you need to understand something: for a union to work all members must be prepared to make sacrifices and stick together.
Butters
But I gotta get back to my family.
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
[drops his sign and drops on one knee next to Butters] We're you family too, Napoleon. We're like you. When we look at you we don't even see the testicles on your chin. We see the testicles in your heart. [back to the freaks] What do we want?
The Freaks
Better prizes!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
When do we want them?
The Freaks
Now!
Butters
Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. [joins the others in the strike. Several police cruisers pull up and police pour out of them]
Police Captain
Okay folks, we're gonna have to move along.
Man with Foot on Head
Why? We're a union and we have a right to picket.
Police Captain
I'm sorry, but the government does not recognize you as a union. You'll have to go.
Middle Dwarf
What are you saying? That because of our appearance our organization is less important?
Police Captain
Now now now, I'm not telling you people that your union doesn't matter, I'm just telling you that you're not really... people.
Man with Foot on Head
...Alright, that does it! It's time to bring out the big guns! Prepare the video sabotage!
Butters
Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh.
Maury Povich show, back to out-of-control-child segment.
Announcer
Who is the most out of controlled child? We're back with Maury.
Maury
We're here, talking with moms who think their children are out of control.
Vanity
What evah!
Cartman
I slaughtered five baby seals with my bare hands. What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
Maury
[walks to the third woman on the panel] Now let's meet Joline. Joline says that her daughter is also out of control, that she's flirting with older men, and, she's only four months old.
Studio Audience
Aawwww.
Joline
Mmhmm, that's right Maurih.
Maury
Let's bring her out: here's Chantal! [Chantal crawls out amid audience boos. The camera focuses on her diaper. Chantal reaches Joline, who picks her up and sits her on the chair next to hers] So Joline, exactly how is your daughter out of control? You say she flirts with older men? [Chantal plays with her rattle]
Joline
Maurih, it's like this: Whenever I have friends over to the house Chantal will come waltzin' in the livin' room completely naked!
Studio Audience
Ooohhh!
Vanity
Whatevah. I helped in a drive-by shooting.
Cartman
What-evah. I digitally put Jabba the Hutt back into the original Star Wars movie! I'll do what I waunt!
Maury
Wow, that is out of control!
Joline
Why, just last night I had three gentlemen callers over to my house, and Chantal took her clothes off right in front o' everybody!
Studio Audience
Boooo! [Chantal drops down and starts wiggling.]
Joline
You see? [Her diaper drops, then her top.] There she goes. There she goes. [Chantal shows her butt to the audience] OH! YOU GOD-DAMNED WHORE!
The screen behind them sputters and changes. The Maury Povich logo disappears.
Man with Foot on Head
[appearing] Attention Maury viewers.
Maury
What the hell is this? [another image replaces the one of Man with Foot on Head]
Elephant Man
A lot of decent hard-working freaks in America are losing their talk-show jobs to freaks of a different nature. Sure, everyone in this great country of ours is a freak, but true, physically deformed freaks must be recognized, for it's these real freaks that make you all feel better about yourselves for not being one. So next time you're watching television, make sure it's a show with "freak" freaks, and not just with people that are freaks because they're stupid trailer trash from the South. That's what we mean when we say, "Look for the True Freak label" [his image fades to that of the True Freak label]
Butters and the Freaks
[Butters sits atop a True Freak label box and starts off] Look for the True Freak label
[four freaks join in] When you are watching a TV talk show
[a side shot of more freaks streaming their way to the box] Remember somewhere,
[a shot of the audience] our union's growing
[a front shot of the freaks walking in] Our wages going to feed the kids.
[a front shot of more freaks walking in] And run the house-
We work hard, but who's complaining?
[a zoom-out shot as the freaks crowd in around Butters] With TFU we're making our way!
[a pan shot] So always look for the True Freak label,
[a full crowd shot] Because you need us right here in the U.S.A.!
[the Maury Povich logo is restored]

Maury
Ah, sorry America, a little glitch there, heh. Anyway-
Man
They're right. We should have never crossed that picket line. Come on, honey. [takes her hand and leads her out. Other audience members begin to grouse and leave]
Maury
[pleading] Wait! Come back, uh-... Maybe we can make the other out-of-control kids take... their clothes off, too!
Cartman
[hops off his chair and steps forward] Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! [more audience members leave]
Cameraman
Sir, the ratings have just started to plummet.
Maury
Ah, those damned freaks! [throws his microphone against the back wall and heads for the exit]
Outside the Maury Povich studio. A door opens and Maury steps out. The freaks stop and wait.
Maury
I gave you shoes! And groceries! And this is how you repay me?! [the freaks simply look back at him] Very well. Just come upstairs and... we'll negotiate! [goes in and slams the door shut. A few seconds later the freaks cheer their victory]
Man with Foot on Head
We did it! The strike worked!
Man with Terrible Skin Condition
Now we can go on with our careers!
Butters
Whoa, thank God that's over. Now I can get back home. [drops his sign and moves off. An angry Cartman catches up to him]
Cartman
Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! [rips the balls off Butters' chin. The freaks react immediately and fall silent]
Butters
Oh. Double hamburgers.
Man with Foot on Head
Jesus Christ! That out-of-control kid ripped poor Napoleon's balls right off!
Incredibly Obese Black Man
Get him!
Cartman
Aaahh! [three freaks trail behind with a boiling pot of water]
Incredibly Obese Black Man
Get him! Get him! [the freaks charge at Cartman, who runs off in fear]
Butters
Hey. Things actually turned out... okay for me this time. [a taxicab pulls up and screeches to a halt]
Stephen
[quickly exits the cab with Linda] Butters!
Butters
[anticipating] Oh I know.
End of Freak Strike

Fun with Veal
A ranch, day. A rancher stands next to his cow corral as the South Park Elementary bus drives up. The bus stops and Ms. Choksondik steps off.
Ms. Choksondik
Okay children, step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - I mean, rancher.
Rancher
Hello, boys and girls. My name is Rancher Bob.
Ms. Choksondik
Let's all say hello to Rancher Bob.
Kids
Hi, Rancher Bob.
Rancher Bob
I'm pleased to show you all the wonderful world of beef. Follow me.
Kyle
[to Stan] City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
Rancher Bob
Now, out here you can see our cattle. This is where the magic begins as the cows eat and sleep and prepare for certain death. [a shot of the cows looking back at the class.]
Cartman
They look so delicious. [Kyle looks at him]
Rancher Bob
[leading the class down a line of cows] Now here we have the slaughterhouse. This is where we turn the cows into steaks and burgers. [a cow moos and a guillotine comes down, chopping its head off.]
Kids
Eewwww!!
Kyle
Aw, dude. [Two workers come and carry the cow's body away, leaving the head behind. Rancher Bob reaches down for a skinned leg and holds it up]
Rancher Bob
Hey, anybody want a free sample?
Cartman
[raises his arm up with glee] Memememee!
Rancher Bob
[now standing next to a darkened doorway] And in here, boys and girls, we have our... [flips on a switch, illuminating the room beyond.] veal ranch. [the class looks at the baby calves in the room. A closeup changes the music from spritely to somber. A shot of the class, with some kids showing some dread. Bob walks over to a calf and kneels by it] You see, with veal the whole key is keepin' the cows chained so they can't walk around or get any exercise. That way, their muscle tissue stays soft, and makes for tender veal.
Stan
Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
Rancher Bob
Yeppir.
Kyle
Then why the hell do they call it "veal"??
Rancher Bob
Well, if we called it "little baby cow" people might not eat it.
Stan
Yeah, I wouldn't have.
Butters
Huh, me neither.
Cartman
Oh, man, look at that one! [moves towards the calves] It looks delicious.
Kyle
What??
Cartman
Mm, succulent and juicy. [reaches the calf he was eyeing] Can we have a free sample of these, too?
Rancher Bob
Well, no, but all these veals are goin' to the slaughterhouse tomorrow mornin'. They'll be steaks by tomorrow afternoon and then you can buy them at your grocery store.
Cartman
Alriiight!
Stan
Tomorrow morning? [a shot of the calves has Stan, Kyle, and Butters transfixed. The rest of the class leaves] Dude, we gotta help them.
Kyle
Yeah.
Cartman's house, night. A light is on in the living room. Cartman is asleep in his bed. Butters, Stan and Kyle climb up to his window.
Stan
[knocks twice on the wall below the window] Pst, Cartman.
Cartman
[responding to a dream] No, Uncle Jesse, no!
Stan
[knocks twice while saying] Cartman, wake up!
Cartman
[wakes up and sees his friends] What? What the hell are you guys doing??
Kyle
[opening the window] Come on, we've gotta go!
Cartman
Where are we going?
Stan
We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
Cartman
What? Why?
Kyle
'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
Cartman
So?
Stan
So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
Cartman
Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me "fatass," "butthole," and "douchebag." I really don't feel like you guys's friend. [lies back down and closes his eyes]
Stan
We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
Butters
Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the "Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset."
Stan
[heaves softly] Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!
Cartman
[sits up] Oho! So you need me and my Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset!
Stan
[plainly] Yes we do. We're those little baby cows' only hope. Will you help us?
Cartman
Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. [turns his ass to Kyle, lowers his pants and underwear, and waits]
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
Kyle
Screw you, Cartman!
Cartman
Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss. [softly] Kiss it.
Stan
Go on, dude it's the only way.
Kyle
No!
Cartman
Kiss it. Come on. [gruffly] Kiss it.
Stan
Just do it really fast, and we can go.
Kyle
Have Butters kiss it.
Cartman
No, it has to be Kyle. [turns away. Kyle resists for a few moments, then slowly moves his face towards Cartman's ass through the window. Kyle finally reaches the ass and Cartman unleashes a juicy fart. Kyle withdraws in fits and starts]
Kyle
Awww! [wipes off his face and then waves away the smell]
Cartman
[laughs uproariously] Oh man, that was soho awesome!
Kyle
Sick! I felt it on my face!
Stan
Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!
Cartman
Hell, I'm not goin' with you! [lies back down and closes his eyes again]
Kyle
Hyaaaa! [lunges at Cartman and starts hitting him]
Cartman
Heeeey! [rolls off the bed and the wrestling continues]
Rancher Bob's ranch, night. The boys are walking on the roof of the veal ranch. They stop, and Stan opens the playset to put on the costume and harness.
Butters
Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: "Not for actual breaking and entering. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime."
Stan
Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too! [holds up parts of a torch] How does this thing work, Cartman?
Cartman
[heaves and takes the torch from Stan] Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask [hands it to Stan] and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. [opens the gas valve and lights the gas stream. A blue flame shoots out and the other boys jump back.]
The hole is created, and Stan, now dressed in black and in harness, is lowered into the ranch. He stops just short of the ground.
Stan
[softly into his headset] Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
Cartman
[peers down. Butters and Kyle join him] You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
Stan
[looks up and calls out] I said that's far enough! [the harness drops to the floor. He gets up and unlocks himself out of the harness, and it goes back up. A calf looks back at him innocently. Stan moves up behind the calf, the softly] Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose. [removes the chain] There you go. You're free. Run away! [the calf doesn't move, and Stan gestures] Go! They're gonna murder you.
Cartman
Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
Kyle
You need to freeze some of your ass off.
Cartman
O! At least I have an ass, Jew!
Kyle
What? [below, Stan removes the chains from the remaining calves]
Stan
Come on, you stupid baby cows! [walks towards the door and lifts up the security bar, then opens the door] You have to get out of here. [they just lift their heads and look at the entrance. The other boys join Stan inside the veal ranch]
Butters
Huuh what's the matter?
Stan
They aren't leaving.
Cartman
See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
Kyle
Hey. They've never been allowed to walk before. They just don't know how.
Stan
Oh yeah, they're too weak to move. [a shot of the calves again] Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
Butters
No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
Stan
Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
Kyle
Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
Stan
I don't know.
Cartman
I've got it. We could kill Butters, and then float the calves on a river of blood.
Kyle
Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
Butters
Eh yeah I do too!
Stan
[moves towards the calves] We're just gonna have to carry them one by one. [lifts up his first calf] Come on, you guys. [Kyle and Butters look at each other, then move to join Stan]
Cartman
Eh! [follows]
The boys are shown walking down an icy road, each carrying a calf... except... one calf is sliding across the ice, then stops. Cartman appears to follow it, but he approaches it and stands next to it.
Cartman
Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. [pushes the calf further across the ice]
Stan's house, day. The boys and the calves are in Stan's room. Three of the boys are there with the calves.
Cartman
Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
Stan
We won't have to. Butters said he had something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
Kyle
Butters had that at his house?
Butters
[enters carrying a box] Hey fellas!
Stan
Butters! [Butters turns] Did you bring it?
Butters
I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
Kyle
All right!
Butters
[reads the box] "Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser."
Stan
What?
Butters
"Makes your calves stronger in just - two days!"
Kyle
Oh, God-damnit! That's your plan?
Butters
Eh, you think it's a gimmick? Susanne promises right on the box that it works.
Stan's house, front door, moments later. Rancher Bob and Officer Barbrady are at the front door. Barbrady knocks. Sharon opens the door and Rancher Bob tips his hat to her.
Officer Barbrady
Hello, Mrs. Marsh.
Sharon
Officer Barbrady. What can I do for you?
Officer Barbrady
Well, we've got a little problem. Gent here caught your boy and his friends trespassing on his ranch. They stole some of his property.
Sharon
Stole? A-a-are you sure? [Randy and Shelly appear next to her]
Rancher Bob
I followed a calf-curling trail right to your house, ma'am.
Shelly
Ooo, Stan's in trouble. Let me kick his ass, Mom.
Sharon
Not now - my son is not a thief. I'm sure this is just some kind of a misunderstanding. [she leads the others upstairs to Stan's room.] Stanley, did you see-? [she's stunned at what she sees]
Stan
Aw crap!
Sharon
Stanley, what are you doing with those calves?
Stan
[points an accusing finger at Rancher Bob and approaches] That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
Randy
Stanley, they belong to him.
Stan
They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
Shelly
Let me hit him, Mom!
Sharon
Stanley, this isn't up for discussion. The rancher is gonna take his cows back and [points at him] you don't have a choice! [Stan looks dejected, then defiant. He closes his door and locks himself in with Cartman, Butters and Kyle. Sharon then pounds on the door and tries to open it] Stanley! Stanley, you open this door right now or you're gonna get it!
Stan
No!
Randy
Stan, you're behaving like a kid!
Stan
You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the ones who knew we were making little baby animals suffer! [walks off to his right]
Sharon
Open this door, now!
Stan
[pushing his dresser into place against the door] Kiss my ass!
Butters
Oh Jeez, he said "ass" to his parents.
Kyle
You're getting in pretty deep, dude. [Stan glares back with a look of determination]
Stan's house, living room. The adults have gone back downstairs.
Sharon
I apologize for this, Mr. rancher person.
Rancher Bob
Oh, why, why don't you just tell them that the cows will be safe. And when they come out I can take them back.
Sharon
I can't lie to my son, okay? If I betrayed him like that, I'd pay for it the rest of my life.
Rancher Bob
Well that's just too bad. Look it, that's eight hundred dollars' worth of veal up there and I have to ship it out Friday. What are you goin' to do, Officer Barbrady?
Officer Barbrady
Me?? How did I get into this mess?
Stan's room. Stan paces the floor.
Kyle
So what happens now?
Stan
I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
Kyle
We're with you, dude.
Butters
Yeah.
Stan
[serious] Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
Cartman
I want out.
Stan
[glares] Shut up, Cartman.
Kyle
We're with you, Stan.
Butters
Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
Stan
Then it's settled. One for all and all for one! Except Cartman.
Kyle, Butters
Yeah!
Cartman
Yeah! Wait-what?
Stan's house, living room, night. Kyle's parents and Butters' parents have joined the other adults.
Sharon
And so that's the situation. Our boys have locked themselves in Stan's room until we can promise them the calves will live free, in writing.
Sheila
Well, this is ridiculous! I don't know how you raise your kids, but my son does not play negotiator with me!
Sharon
Well excuse me, Sheila, but it wasn't that simple!
Sheila
HA! Give me fifteen seconds with Kyle and I'll have that door open! [the adults leave the living room and go up the stairs, stopping at Stan's door] Kyle?! [pounds on the door] This is your mother! You will open this door right now!
Kyle
[pause] ...No I won't.
Sharon
[gets to retort] Yes, I see what you mean, Sheila. [Sheila looks at her] That was very impressive.
Sheila
[turns back to the door] Kyle, if you don't do as you're told, I'm going to be very angry!
Kyle
Well you made me eat veal and didn't tell me what it was. So go ahead and be angry, you baby calf-killing bitch!
Sharon
[folds her arms] Very persuasive.
Sheila
[starts pounding away furiously at the door] AAAAA! Open this door!! Open this door!!
Stephen
[calms Sheila down and takes over] Whoa-ho-ho, let, let me try. [faces the door] Butters? [slight zoom-in on Butters] Butters, this is your father.
Butters
[to the boys] Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
Stan
Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
Stephen
Butters? Answer me!
Butters
[to the boys] But they-ah they're angry at me.
Kyle
Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say. [begins to whisper in Butters' ear] You can tell them...
Stephen
Butters! Right now!
Butters
Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
Stephen
WHAT?!
Butters
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Stephen
[turns to the other adults] What's gotten into them?
Sharon
Alright, Stanley, this has gone on long enough! Your little game is over!
Stan
This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until we know the calves will be safe.
Sharon
Well that's fine! You boys can just stay in there and starve to death. Us parents are going to go to Pizza Shack and have pepperoni pizzas and ice cream.
Cartman
[weakening] Oh, God-damnit you guys.
Kyle
Cartman, stay away from that door!
Sharon
You'll have to come out sooner or later, boys. The longer you wait, the more trouble you'll be in. [the adults walk away, but Sheila stops and turns back to the door.]
Sheila
[pounds on the door once more] Mmmrragh!!
Stan
[sighs] Round one is over. We made it. [the boys gather in]
Cartman
We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
Stan
Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
Kyle
But we will have to sleep, dude.
Stan
Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
Butters
[finding a way to relate] Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
Stan
We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! [one calf takes a dump on the carpet, another walks up and takes a piss on it]
Stan's house, living room, after dinner. The women wait at the sofa while the men try to remove the door with tools. Liane is now present as Sheila crosses her arms and pats her left shoulder with her right hand. Moments later, the men come down the stairs.
Randy
Well we tried everything. We can't get through the door without tearing apart the house.
Sheila
Dear God, it's been over thirteen hours!
Liane
Oh, but my poor little poopsie must be getting so hungry. Maybe we should get them a little food.
Sharon
Ms. Cartman, this is a battle of wills. We need our boys to know that we're not gonna cave in, at all.
Liane
Oh, all right.
Sheila
Let's all just go to bed and let them play their little game for as long as they can.
Stan's room, night. From outside, his room is the only one lit. Inside, Cartman, Kyle and Butters are in his bed while Stan sits at his desk.
Butters
Good night, fellas!
Kyle
Good night.
Butters
[to the calves] Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Neptune. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
Cartman
Butters, I'm going to kill you over and over again.
Stan's room, fade to day. Hour 29. The boys are all drowsy and a little disheveled. Stan sits on his bed stroking a calf, Butters sits on the floor, Cartman rests against a calf, Kyle holds his stomach.
Cartman
Can't go on. Need... food...
Kyle
We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
Cartman
There's only one alternative, you guys. We're gonna have to eat a calf.
Stan
No, Cartman, we're not eating a calf!
Cartman
All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. [points]
Kyle
[looks back at Stan] He might be right, dude.
Butters
Aw, heck. [a basket floats up to the window on a pole]
Stan
Wait, what is that? [points to the basket. The other three boys turn. Cartman approaches the window and takes the basket] Dude!
Cartman
Food!
Stan's house, outside. Liane lowers her pole as Sharon and Sheila go outside to see what's going on.
Sharon
Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?
Liane
Oh, I just can't stand to see my baby suffer.
Sheila
Oh dear God, you've ruined everything.
Stan's room, moments later. The boys take shares of food out of the basket. Stan walks away with two apples.
Kyle
All right!
Stan
See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
Cartman
Look you guys! Beef jerky!
Kyle
Yeah! And fried chicken! [Stan sits at a corner with his apples.]
Stan
[sensing a lapse] Wha? [rises and walks to his bed, where the other boys sit eating]
Kyle, Cartman
Mmmmm.
Stan
Dude, what are you guys doing?
Kyle
We're eating, dude.
Stan
You're eating meat! What the hell do you guys think we're doing all this for?!
Kyle
Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
Butters
Me neither.
Cartman
Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
Stan
[returns to his corner] That's fine! You guys can live off of flesh, but I'm never eating meat again!
Cartman
Go ahead, that's more for us. [tempts the calf next to him with some beef jerky] You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry? [the calf starts chewing on it] Who's the hungry man?
Kyle
[looks over] Dude, that's messed up. [Stan looks as well, but goes back to his apples]
Stan's house, night, Hour 34. Police and fire departments and an ambulance are at the house, with a kleig light shining into Stan's room from the fire truck. Inside, Stan sits on the floor still eating his apples, Cartman stands next to the chair, Butters sits on the bed. The sound of breaking news is heard.
Kyle
You guys, check this out! [a TV now sits where the football normally is, and the picture shown is that of Stan's house. The other boys join Kyle in looking at the news report from News 4]
Field Reporter
Tom, I'm standing in front of the house where four insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle.
Butters
Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are. [Cartman looks at him, then slugs him hard] Eugh!
Field Reporter
Several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful, Tom, and the crisis is intensifying. Here's what some people have to say.
Thomas
[with wife and son] We were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion. I mean, to think this could happen right here in our own community. [Craig shows his right middle finger to the camera. Next, the boys' parents are shown]
Randy
We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!
Field Reporter
The police chief of South Park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists.
Butters
Oh no. Eh this is big-time trouble now, fellas.
Stan
No, this is exactly what we wanted.
Kyle
It is?
Stan
Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
Field Reporter
Tom, it looks like I have an update: Yes, it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone. Uh, nothing else was going on, Tom, so this was the only story we had to make seem important, but people are just simply tuning out. So, HBC will now be switching programming once again to "Puppies from Around the World."
The news break switches to a series of dog scenes. First, dalmatians run across a field to the tune of bagpipes, then a small dog looks around to the tune of Chinese music, then a puppy in a basket as a mariachi band is heard, then another dog is shown, then another, then a puppy is shown following a tennis ball, then another dog plays with the camera as more mariachi music is heard.
Stan
[the boys are stunned] ...I don't believe it.
Butters
Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
Stan's house, fade to day. Hour 53. Stan and Butters are sleeping, and Butters, sleeping face down, has his left arm across Stan's chest. Stan stirs and opens his eyes.
Stan
[notices the situation] Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! [Butters stirs and turns around]
Butters
[waking] Oh, sorry. I thought you were Mr. Pickles. [voices are heard outside and the boys sit up, then move towards the window]
Voices
We must help the helpless, we must save the unsaved
Kyle
Huh, what the hell is that?
Hippies
If we... fight together we can make sure the road is paved.
For a... brighter tomorrow...
Cartman
Hippies!
Stan
What are they doing here?
Hippie
[on bullhorn] We're with you boys! Your message is real and your fight is just. [the other hippes start cheering]
Hippies
Hooray! Hooray!
Kyle
Dude! Those gaywads are on our side?
Butters
Ew, they're all dirty.
Cartman
What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
Stan's house, night, Hour 75. Police and fire departments and an ambulance have returned. HBC News is there again with its field reporter.
Field Reporter
Tom, the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the FBI arrive to put an end to the conflict. [FBI vehicles speed in and FBI agents pour out of the vehicles]
Sharon
[not believing what she sees] Oh Jesus Christ. [slaps her hand to her forehead]
FBI Agent
Who's in charge here?
Officer Barbrady
I am. But I don't want to be.
FBI Agent
Where's the negotiator?
FBI Negotiator
Right here! Glen Dumont, Negotiator Squad.
FBI Agent
All right, see what you can do.
Stan's room. Stan is petting a calf. Kyle looks on. Stan coughs and sniffs.
Kyle
Dude, are you okay?
Stan
Aw, I just feel so rundown. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got these sores. [lifts up his shirt to show the sores to the others]
Butters
What is that?
Kyle
Dude, maybe we should end this.
Stan
No!
Stan's house, outside. The negotiator walks up to the negotiation van, which has all the equipment he needs to handle a negotiation.
Glen Dumont
Give me a hard line to the phone in that house! [a squad member gets on it]
Officer Barbrady
The terrorists already said there's no way they're coming out.
Glen Dumont
[receives the phone] Don't worry, I'm a negotiator. It's my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology.
Stan's room. The phone rings and Stan goes to answer it.
Stan
Hello?
Glen Dumont
Hello, my name is Mike. I'm a negotiator. Is it okay if I talk to you?
Stan
Ah, hold on. [turns to the other boys] It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
Kyle
Don't give him anything!
Stan
What do I say??
Cartman
[walks up to Stan and takes over] Dah, give me that! [takes the receiver from Stan] Talk to me Mike.
Glen Dumont
I'm here to make sure we can all end this peacefully. You want that, right?
Cartman
Sure, sure.
Glen Dumont
How about we make a trade, just show that we can trust each other.
Cartman
What do you have in mind?
Glen Dumont
Well, how about you send out one of the calves?
Cartman
Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
Glen Dumont
Just one, that's all we want.
Cartman
All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
Stan
Cartman, no!
Kyle
Dude! [Cartman holds out his palm to silence them]
Cartman
[clears his throat] We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.
Glen Dumont
What? I, I can't do that.
Cartman
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
Glen Dumont
No no wait, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yuh, you're right. What reason do you have to trust me? I'm just a guy from Lakewood trying to make ends meet, you know? Just a blue-collar guy like your dad.
Cartman
Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
Glen Dumont
[trumped] Oh. All right, fine, son of a gun, let me see what I can do.
Stan's house, night, Hour 154. The authorities are still there, waiting out the standoff.
Glen Dumont
Okay. Up a little... left a little... [a crane lifts a box of ammunition towards Stan's window. Kyle and Butters wait for it] Almost there.
Randy
[arrives with Sharon] What is that?
Glen Dumont
We're giving the boys some guns in return for a calf.
Randy
What?
Sharon
You're giving my baby guns?
Glen Dumont
[snaps back] Hey, this is a negotiation process, okay? Did you people go to negotiator school? No, you didn't! [walks off in a huff to the negotiation van] Get them on the line for me!
Cartman
[answers the ringing phone] Hello.
Glen Dumont
Alright, you see that? I keep my end of the bargain.
Cartman
All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. [in the background, Kyle takes out the guns, tossing them to Butters]
Glen Dumont
Well, ha- how about you send out two calves?
Cartman
Oh, Jesus! You know, there's just no talking to you, is there, Mike?! [Butters assembles a machine gun while Kyle inspects a sword. Stan lies by a corner in a fetal position, on a calf, with more lesions appearing on his face]
Stan
O-ogh...
Cartman
We had a deal! Do you think I'm stupid?! Don't treat me like I'm stupid here! [Butters plays soldier in the background, moving his gun around and then saluting while Kyle practices some lunges]
Glen Dumont
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [to fellow agents as he holds his hand over the mouthpiece] Damnit, I'm losing them. [to Cartman] Okay, I'm sorry. Just send out one calf.
Cartman
Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! [Kyle tosses a dud grenade at Butters, who hits it with a spear. The grenade flies off the bed and onto the floor. Kyle and Butters jump with joy]
Glen Dumont
What do you have in mind?
Stan's house, day. Hour 169. This makes one week and an hour since the standoff began.
Glen Dumont
A little to the left... [this time the crane is lifting a missile] Okay, that's good. A little to the right. [Butters and Kyle wait by the window again]
Sheila
You're giving them a missile??
Glen Dumont
[losing patience] Stand down, ma'am! Stand down! This is a delicate process! I've almost earned their trust!
Stan's room.
Kyle
[dabbing Stan's sores with a moist towel] Stan's getting worse, you guys.
Cartman
Mike, speak.
Glen Dumont
How are we doin'?
Cartman
We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
Glen Dumont
Weh ah I did manage to get the FDA to officially change the word "veal" to "tortured baby cow." [holds up an FDA document]
Cartman
Good, good.
Glen Dumont
But I couldn't get you North and South Dakota.
Cartman
Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
Glen Dumont
Now, now please can, can we get you to come out? [Cartman looks over at Stan, who looks sicker by the minute]
Outside Stan's house, night.
Glen Dumont
All right, everythng has worked out. The boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them.
Adults
Yes! All right! Woohoo!
Officer Barbrady
Whoops, sorry I doubted your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.
FBI Agent
They're coming out now?
Glen Dumont
Yes. All we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to Denver International Airport, where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to Mexico.
Sharon
What??
Glen Dumont
And they want the guy that plays Mr. Worf on "Star Trek" to drive the truck. [beat] In full makeup.
Randy
Jesus Christ!
FBI Agent
All right, that does it! You are in fact the worst negotiator I've ever seen in action!
Glen Dumont
All right, all right, I'll give you that. But in return, I want three staples.
FBI Agent
Get out of here! [Dumont bolts. The agent talks to Barbrady] We'll get them the semi, and we'll get them the Worf guy. If they see that, they'll come out and then, we could take them.
Officer Barbrady
But isn't that dishonest?
FBI Agent
Maybe so, but if we don't do something soon, there could be fifty, even sixty people who'll have to go without veal for dinner. Are you prepared to let that happen?
Outside Stan's house, night. Hour 201, just after sunset. The semi-truck Cartman ordered arrives.
FBI Agent
All right. Where is Mr. Dorn?
Michael Dorn
[aka Worf, arrives in full makeup] I was woken up at three in the morning, told I had to put on makeup, and come to this town. [folds his arms] What the hell is going on?!
FBI Agent
I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn. It's FBI business. We've got terrorists making demands and we need your help.
Michael Dorn
This is highly unusual!
FBI Agent
[on the bullhorn] All right boys, we have your truck. And we have an airplane on the tarmac at Denver International.
Cartman
And Worf?
Michael Dorn
My name is Michael Dorn. I play a character called Worf.
Kyle
[rushes to Stan] Stan! It worked!
Stan
[looking very weak and with a few more sores on his body] It... did?
Kyle
They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
Stan
Pick me up. I... I want to see. [Kyle picks him up]
Outside Stan's house, night. The authorities prepare for the kids' surrender. The front door opens and Cartman looks out. The FBI agents take aim.
Cartman
Step back! Tell those men to step back!
FBI Agent
Do it!
FBI Agents
[lowering their weapons and stepping back] Mmrrrr.
Hippies
All right! Woohoo! Yeah!
Cartman
[heads for the street] Aw, shut up, you freakin' hippies! [approaches the semi-truck, where Michael Dorn now sits at the wheel. He gets into the passenger side and sits] Alright, Mr. Worf, start the engine and put her in gear. Oh, and you must refer to me as "Captain."
Michael Dorn
Where am I supposed to drive to?
Cartman
No. See, you must say, "Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?"
Michael Dorn
Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?
Cartman
You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
Michael Dorn
This whole thing is ridiculous!
Cartman
[correcting Dorn] "Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!"
Michael Dorn
[beat, then in a low voice] Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous. [starts up the engine]
Cartman
[calls out] Okay, all set!
An overhead view of the scene shows a News 4 helicopter covering the story — from the camera of another News 4 helicopter.
Field Reporter
Tom, it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi. This is still very uninteresting news, Tom.
Ground view, inside the trailer.
Butters
Okay Cartman!
Ground view, on the street.
Cartman
Step on it, Mr. Worf! [the semi peels off]
Boys
All right!
Inside the trailer.
Butters
We're going! [Kyle grins]
Kyle
Mexico here we come! [Dorn honks to clear everyone out of the way.]
In the cab. Police cars follow the semi.
Cartman
Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
Michael Dorn
We cannot keep going fast on these icy roads!
Cartman
[correcting gently] "Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?"
Michael Dorn
Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads.
Cartman
Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
Inside the trailer. Stan casts his eyes down at the floor.
Kyle
Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
On the street. The semi passes by Rancher Bob's ranch.
FBI Agent
Alright, they're in front of the cattle ranch. Hit it! [another agent presses a button and a buzzer is heard. A few seconds later balloons fill up under the semi and lift it off the ground. The whole thing comes to a stop]
Cartman
[looks out] Oh, it's a double-cross!!
FBI Agent
[approaches with his fellow agents] Alright, boys! The game is over! Get out of the truck with your hands up!
In the trailer.
Kyle
Oh no! No!!
In the cab.
Cartman
What are you waiting for? Go kill them, Worf!
Michael Dorn
I'm NOT killing anybody!
Cartman
Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
Rancher Bob's Cattle Ranch, moments later. The FBI agents take the calves into the veal ranch as the boys stand next to the semi. Michael Dorn is there as well.
Stan
We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!
FBI Agent
[On the bullhorn] Alright boys, just stay right there until your parents arrive.
Michael Dorn
Can I go now?
Officer Barbrady
Here you go, Mr. Rancher. I got your cattle back for you.
Rancher Bob
Oh. [glances at the stack of veal forming next to him] Well, it doesn't matter now.
Officer Barbrady
What do you mean?
Rancher Bob
In the twenty-four hours since the word "veal" was officially changed to "little tortured baby cow" the market has gone dry. Seems that people see "little tortured baby cow" on their menus, they don't feel like orderin'.
Butters
Really?
Rancher Bob
Yep, damn things ain't worth spit now. I'll let 'em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life.
Kyle
Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry! [Stan doesn't respond. He's passed out] Stan? Stan?? [Butters appears next to them]
Hell's Pass Hospital, next day. The boys and their families are present at Stan's hospital bed. Stan is half-awake now, hooked up to IVs and all.
Dr. Doctor
He's very lucky you got him here when you did. He was in a very advanced state of vaginitis.
Randy
Vaginitis?
Dr. Doctor
It occurs when a person stops eating meat. Those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas. If we hadn't stopped it in time, Stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy.
Kyle
Whoa, dude.
Dr. Doctor
We've got an IV of pure beef blood pumping into Stan's veins and the... sores are fading.
Cartman
Thank God we stopped it in time.
Stan
Well, I guess we learned something today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
Butters
Hear hear.
Sheila
All right boys, it's time to go home. You've got some serious grounding time to start.
Stephen
I'll say!
Butters
Aw, we're still grounded?
Kyle
But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
Gerald
Yes Kyle, but you still defied your parents. And you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer.
Stephen
That's right, let's get these terrorists to their rooms. [Sternly] But first, [softens] maybe we can grab some burgers.
The Boys
All right!
End of Fun with Veal

The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer
Stan's house, night. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters gather some snacks and put them on the coffee table in the Marsh living room.
Stan
[pouring chips into a bowl] This is gonna be so awesome!
Kyle
Do we have everything?
Stan
Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anything!
Cartman
All right!
Kyle
Look, it's almost time.
HBC commercial.
Announcer
Up next on HBC, the Russell Crowe Show!
The sofa. The boys climb on it.
Stan
Alright, here we go.
Russell Crowe Show intro.
Choir
Born in New Zealand in sixty-four
[Russell sails on a tugboat called "Tugger"]
A hot-headed actor named Russell Crowe
[Russell holds an Oscar lovingly]
He loves to act but he loves one thing more:
[Russell in a scene from "Gladiator"]
Fight-in' Round The World
[Russell fighting bar patrons at Hap's Bar]
He fights his directors and he fights his fans
[Russell holds a director up in the air by the lapels, then he fights fans in a pool hall]
It's a problem no one understands
[Russell fights people in Paris]
[spoken by a singer]
If there's two things he love it's fighting and,
[Russell dances Russian before the Kremlin as a camera man follows him at a distance]
Fight-in' Round The World
[The cameraman takes a picture and Russell beats him up]
Makin' movies, makin' music and

Fight-ing Round The World!

[spoken by a singer as a spinning globe appears behind the show logo]
Russell Crowe

Russell Crowe
[dressed as a sailor, standing on a dock] Hello, everybody. I'm Russell Crowe, and this is "Fight-in' Round The World" [puts up his fists and cycles them around]. We're gonna have lots of fun tuhday as we travel all around, and look for some good- [a man walks through his shot and Russell does a double-take, then goes after the man] Ay! What the hell do yuh think you're doin'?! [Russell's cameraman moves the camera to catch up with him] You walked right through my shot, mate! Do you know who I am?!
Man
Oh, excuse me. I was just- [Russell proceeds to beat the crap out of the man]
Russell Crowe
God-damned smartass! Do you think you could [Shelly comes in and takes the remote, changing the channel. She stops at the WD]
Stan
Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!
Shelly
Shut up, turd. I'm watching Buffy.
Stan
[rushes up to her] No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! [she switches back to HBC]
Russell Crowe Show.
Russell Crowe
Oh! Get up! Get up, you little pussy! [the man crawls along the dock on his belly]
Shelly
The Russell Crowe Show? You turds don't even like that show!
Russell Crowe (off-screen)
Oh ya like that do ya?! [punches heard]
Stan
It's not the show we care about. During one of the commercial breaks of tonight's episode, they're gonna show the exclusive never-before-seen trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie!
Kyle
It's the biggest night of the year.
Shelly
[switching channels again] That's stupid! See your turdy trailer some other time!
Stan
But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
Shelly
No, turds!
Cartman
Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
Shelly
Shut up, fat turd!!
Cartman
I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
Shelly
We're not watching this! [a shot of Russell Crowe and the man]
Russell Crowe
Come on!
Man
Look, I apologize, but I was just--
Stan
But Shelly, it's the Russell Crowe Show! You always said there's nothing you love more than Russell Crowe.
Shelly
[softly, voice rising] There is one thing I love more than Russell Crowe, and that is seeing you unhappy. So, Buffy it is!
Stan
Shelly, please, let us watch. We'll do anything. Anything!
Shelly
[glances away, then looks at Stan] All right. I just started my period, and I need tampons. If one of you turds go buy them at the store for me, you can watch your stupid turd show with your stupid turd movie commercial in it!
Stan
[glances down, then answers] O-K, deal.
Shelly
And they'd better be here when I come back downstairs, turds! [slaps Stan twice and walks off]
Russell Crowe
Well, that was a lot of fun, wadn't it, kids? But it looks like if we're gonna get in more fights, we're gonna have to go look for 'em.
Kyle
[gathers around Stan with the other boys] Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway.
Butters
Ehyeah!
Stan
[somber] Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
Kyle
You'd miss the new trailer?
Stan
Dude, I'm not going.
Cartman
Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? [points to Stan]
Stan
Stan.
Cartman
Stan, okay. What's your name? [points to Kyle]
Kyle
Kyle.
Cartman
Kyle. What's your name? [looks at Butters]
Butters
Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?
Cartman
Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
Kyle
Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
Butters
Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. [heads for the door. The other three go back to the sofa]
Russell Crowe
Seems like no one else here wants to fight.
Kyle
Dude, thank God for stupid people ["...We'll have to go somewhere else..."]
Cartman
Amen.
Russell Crowe
...lets ask our old friend, Tugger. Where should we go fight people next, Tugger?
Tugger
TOOOOOOT
Russell Crowe
Great idea! [runs up to the camera] Tugger thinks we should go to the faaar away country of China. [backs up towards the tug boat] China is one of the oldest civilizations on earth. And from what I understand, they LOVE a good fight! So let's go! [rushes onto the tugboat and sets off.]
Tugger
TOOOT TOOOT [a man and a woman appear]
Man with Mustache
Oh my God! It's Russell Crowe!
Russell Crowe
[taunts back] Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe! Oh my Gmah, bah bah byah byah! [gets out and heads for the man and woman] Why don't you mind your own business, you scrotum?! [punches the man. Cut to a sailing Tugger]
Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world.

Stan
Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
Russell Crowe
[at the wheel] What a glorious day to spend a way, fight-in' round the world. [whistles and spins the boat's wheel]
Cartman
What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. [takes a hold of the remote]
Stan
They look fine to me. [another shot of Russell sailing away]
Kyle
Just don't mess with it, Cartman.
Cartman
[leaves the sofa] Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. [heads for the television]
Kyle
Just just leave it alone.
Cartman
Dude, do you wanna see the Terrance & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? [moves the cable, and the vertical goes out of whack]
Stan
That's worse!
Cartman
Okay, how about ... that? [moves it again, and the cathode ray tube pops. The wall behind the TV is blackened, and Cartman slowly peeks]
Stan
Dude!
Kyle
God-dammit Cartman! You broke it!
Cartman
[panicked] It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!
Stan
Dude, the commercials could start any time!
Cartman
I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
Kyle
God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
Stan
Get all the stuff! [they gather the snacks and head for the front door. Cartman opens the door and Butters arrives]
Butters
Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
Stan
We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! [the three boys exit]
Butters
Oh Jeez. [follows]
The neighborhood. The boys run towards Kyle's house. Stan leads the way, with Kyle and Butters following.
Butters
Oh boy, uh, Oh Jeez, Oh Jeez!
Stan
Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!
Cartman
[gruffly] Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!
Kyle's house, moments later. Ike is watching TV.
A Voice
[a slow drawl] ...but the Palestinian government uh is not going to see any for future- [the front door opens and the boys run in.]
Stan
Huff, huff
Butters
Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry! [Kyle takes the remore and quickly changes channels, and the Russell Crowe show pops up]
Russell Crowe
And so here we are in history-rich Ch-ooina.
Kyle
We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. [the boys sit on the sofa. Ike looks at each of them angrily]
Kyle, Stan, Butters
Phew!
Ike
Hey! Imong telling Dat!
Cartman
[arrives breathless] Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.
Ike
Dadadadat!
Kyle
No Ike! They're playing the trailer to the new Terrance & Phillip movie during the show, and we have to watch it! [Ike drops down and walks away, Cartman sits next to Butters]
Russell Crowe
[hiding behind a potted shrub which he carries before him. He sets it down and look at the camera] This is Tiananmen Square. Lots of good foightin' has gone on here throughout the years, including a fan-tastic massacre that took place back in '93. [he turns back to the shrub and peers through it. The Chinese are pleasantly involved in conversations. Russell turns back to the camera] These chinamen can grow to over five feet tall, and in a fight, are known to kick with their legs. Let's see if we can get in for a closer look. [picks up the shrub and goes further into the crowd, then peers through the shrub. The Chinese notice him] Oi! [he looks back at the camera] I've gotten close enough now that they're startin' to get real froigh'ened. You can see the fine hairs on the back of their necks standin' on end. [turns to the shrub and jumps through it, grabbing a man's ankles] Gotcha mate! [the victimized man speaks first, then another man answers. Russell's head turns to see who's speaking, then he jumps up to challenge the second man] Ah, you wanna fight, huh?! [challenges the first] Think you could take me, you little buggers?! [punches the first man and the man sails to the ground a few feet away, knocked out cold. Blood pours from his nose. The man he lands in front of decides to fight, and soon Russell Crowe is punching men away left and right. A policeman arrives, and Russell knocks him away, too]
Cartman
God, when is this gonna get to the commercials? [Gerald arrives with Ike]
Gerald
Kyle, Ike says you kicked him off the TV.
Kyle
They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer.
Gerald
You know your brother watches MacNeil/Lehrer Report every night at ten!
Ike
Etetheh bunlapala un night.
Kyle
But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
Gerald
It doesn't matter! Ten to eleven is Ike's time to watch MacNeil/Lehrer.
Kyle
God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
Stan
Aww! [the boys gather their snacks and head for the door]
Cartman
Argh!
Butters
Whoa, wait fellas. [the boys stop] We can't go to my house.
Cartman
We can't go to my house either. It's being fumigated.
Stan
AGH! [thinks hard, then] Wait! Chef just got a new plasma screen TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! [they leave. Ike goes back to the sofa and sits, changing the channel]
Lehrer
...taking place there all these years is sure to continue until the governments of these regions can actually come about some...
Ike
It's a birdy fly.
The neighborhood. The boys run towards Chef's house. Stan, Kyle, and Butters run past, huffing and puffing.
Cartman
[trailing again] Ey! You guys! I'm seriouslih!
Chef's house, moments later. The boys are at his front door, and Stan knocks.
Kyle
God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
Chef
[answers the door in his nightgown] Oh. Hello there, children.
The Boys
[quickly] Hey Chef. [run for his sofa, leaving Chef at the door.]
Chef
Uh, how's it goin'?
Chef's living room. The boys are seated on the sofa, with Stan trying to get the remote control working.
Chef
[arrives] Oh, you wanted to see the new TV, huh? [a new HDTV with side speakers and settop cable box, and a rather large base] Pretty cool, ain't it?
Stan
[impatient] Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?
Chef
Uh, I don't know. This TV has more features than a space shuttle. [Chef takes the remote and fiddles with it] I can't figure it out at all. [the program pops up immediately]
Russell Crowe
[in India] -bloomin' Taj Mahal.
Cartman
There, you got it, you got it!
Russell Crowe
[punching the natives - hits one] Freakin' Indies [hits a second] really put up a [hits a third] fight!
Stan
We made it!
Cartman
Oh, thank God.
Chef
Russell Crowe?? Children, you shouldn't be watching this show about a man who beats people up because he's insecure.
Cartman
We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer for the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.
Russell Crowe
[still punching Indians as they approach] Alright everyone, we're gonna take our first commercial break. But be sure not to go anywhere, because there's lot's more people to beat up!
Stan
Here they come!
Kyle
Heuh, the commercials! [some commercials air, but they're not important, as little sound is heard]
Announcer
And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!
The Boys
[disappointed] Awww!
Butters
Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
Stan
I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
Kyle
Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
Russell Crowe
Making movies, making songs 'n fight-in' round the world. [cut to Brooklyn, with the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. A lot of brownstones here. Russell has brought his schrub with him again. He approaches the camera] Oi! Now Tugger's brought me to one of the greatest places for foightin' in North America. [backs up] Brooklyn, New York. Lots of minorities here, and they don't take kindly to whitey. [points to himself] Let's get a closer look. Come on, Tugger! [picks up his shrub and runs. Tugger hops after him, tooting along. They end up looking at a pickup basketball game in the shadow of some skyscrapers. Russell peers through the shrub, then turns to the camera] Looks like we got some black people, and some Puerto Ricans. [a quick peek] Notice the colorful rags on their heads, meaning they could be part of a gang, and therefore, [makes a fist] real used to fightin'. [peers through the shrub]
Black Player
Hey, look at that guy over there. Ain't that that Gladiator guy?
Puerto Rican Player
Where?
Black Player
Behind that plant, next to that tugboat? [Russell peers through, but the shows his face]
Puerto Rican Player
Oh yeah, I think it is.
Russell Crowe
[in condescending falsetto] Oh my God, it's the Gladiator guy! [heads for the basketball court and puts up his fists] Oh my God, I've never seen an actor before! [moves around for anyone to fight] Why don't you choke on some pig vomit, you stupid sobs!
Chef
Why can't this guy control his temper?
Russell Crowe
Well?? You all just gonna stand there or are you gonna fight? [knocks down a black player. Another one punches him in the back of the head] Oi! Crikey, you've done it now!
Cartman
This TV is great, Chef.
Chef
Yeah, and it's got all kinds of cool features, too. Check this out. You can watch three channels all at once. I think if you hit this button here- [a menu pops up on a blue screen. He presses more buttons and the default choice changes, but nothing else] No, no wait. You hit this button here [ends up at clock reset function] No, that's not it. Let's see. [presses another button] Menu... [press] Function [screen properties pop up]
Stan
Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. [looks like Russell is fighting Germans, but the menu windows block the view]
Chef
Let's see. Menu? [screen resolution, manual programming, spectrum density, profiles, audio settings, and so on pop up] Aw, dammit!
Kyle
Get it back to normal, Chef!
Chef
I'm tryin', children! Menu, back, function- [still no success. The blue screen is still there] Enter? No, no. Back? H.E.M?? [selects 'yes']
The TV
[transforms itself into a robot] Human eradication mode, active. [it rises from its base, which becomes its feet. The side speakers re-position themselves as guns, and the cable box becomes the eyes. Chef and the boys are stunned by what they just saw. The TV turns to its right and heads for the front door. It breaks through, goes down the steps, and immediately starts firing at everything in sight.]
Stan
Oh God-dammit!
Kyle
The TV left.
Butters
Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
Stan
Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! [the four get off the sofa and head out the door. A car screeches to a halt, and the TV fires at the driver, forcing the couple inside to flee]
The neighborhood. The boys run towards the bar. Stan, Kyle, and Butters run past, huffing and puffing.
Butters
Where do we go? Where do we go?
Stan
The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
Cartman
Aagh! God-dammit!
The bar. The boys burst through the door and head for the counter. The TV turns on to the Russell Crowe show.
Russell Crowe
[back in Brooklyn, amid the bunch of beat-up basketball players] You fight like Norwegians, ya fairies!
The Boys
Phew!
Stan
We made it.
Cartman
[blubbering] This is killing me. The human body was not meant to move quickly like that.
The Russell Crowe show.
Russell Crowe
These are the Florida Keys, a remote island chain just a few miles from... Oi! Wait a minute! Wasn't I just in Brooklyn fightin' minorities? What happened with that?
Tugger
Mooooot.
Russell Crowe
It's that God-damned editor! He cut the Brooklyn scene short! Tugger, I'm gonna get him!
The editing room, moments later.
Editor
Yeah. Oh I'm just working. I'm probably done around seven. [the door flies open and Russell stomps in there]
Russell Crowe
[lifts the editor up by the collar] Who the hell do you think you are?!
Editor
I'm the editor.
Russell Crowe
I know you're the bloomin' editor! I mean, who do you think you are cuttin' one of my foightin' scenes short?!
Editor
Dude, the director said to cut it.
Russell Crowe
Moy foightin' is poetry! You don't edit Russell Crowe's poetry, you testicle! [drops him, pauses, then delivers three blows to the belly]
Jimbo
Well that guy's just plain nuts.
Barkeep
[rushes over] Hey hey hey, whoa, you kids can't be in here. [the kids are dumbstruck]
Kyle
We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
Barkeep
You ain't midgets, your lips are too full. [the boys stay silent] Now GET OUT!!
Stan
But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
Barkeep
Look, this is a bar! We can't have children in here. People come here for debauchery and sin!
Cartman
Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
Butters
Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
Barkeep
GET OUT!!! [walks over and turns the TV to a baseball game]
The Boys
Aaah!
Stan
[the first to head for the door] Come on, we gotta get to a TV! [the others follow]
Cartman
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!
Downtown South Park. The TV, now a robot, marches through town blasting holes into buildings. Chef follows behind on a cell phone.
Chef
Yes, is this customer service? I'm havin' problems with my new television. It sprouted legs and guns 'n started walkin' around shootin' people. Uh huh. Okay. Ohhh, so I press "menu," then "function." [presses the buttons. The TV shoots at a man locking up a store, making him spill his groceries and fall on his back. The TV stops]
Townsman
Jesus! [gets up and runs] Waaaah! [the TV moves forward again]
Chef
No, that didn't work. Did I set the internal clock? Uh, no. [listens] Oh, really? Well, how do I do that?
Shady Acres, A Retirement Community. The boys rush in and head for the empty seats in the TV room.
Cartman
Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! [once the boys are in place, Stan walks over to the TV and turns it on. "Puppies From Around The World" comes on, and Stan quickly changes the channel to the Russell Crowe show]
Kyle
We're not too late! [the boys grin]
Russell Crowe
Come on, Tugger ol' mate. Why are you lookin' so down?
Tugger
Mooot, mooot.
Russell Crowe
[whispers to the camera] Tugger's in a bit of a sad state. Seems his girlfriend and him had a bit of a row last night.
Tugger
Mooooot.
Old Man
[everyone watches silently, then] ...What is this?
The Russell Crowe show.
Russell Crowe
Come on. Cheer up, Tugger. How can I make you feel better? I know! [grabs a guitar off-screen and prepares to play it.] How would you like me to sing one of the songs off me new album?
Tugger
[shakes its smokestack with each protest] Nooo! Nooooo!
Russell Crowe
What's that, Tugger? You say you really love the songs on my album?
Tugger
Noooooooooo! [shakes its smokestack]
Russell Crowe
Alright then, Tugger. [begins strumming]
Tugger
Noo, no! [shakes its smokestack]
Russell Crowe
You know that you're my baby. You know I need you now.
Tugger
[tries to escape, but can't, as it's tied to the dock] Noooooooooo! [shakes its smokestack]
Russell Crowe
I don't know where I'm goin', I gotta get there some, yeah gotta get there, somehow.
Tugger
[returns and tries to rip itself away towards the right with all its might] Noooooooooo! [turns and tries to pull itself away towards the left, but can't]
Russell Crowe
Gotta get there somehow.
Tugger
[continues to struggle] Noooooooooo! [turns and tries to pull itself away towards the left, but can't]
Russell Crowe
You can stay away tonight, but I'm gonna sleep here, in my explosive clouds...
Tugger
[returns, then takes out its arms for the first time] NOOOOO! [pulls out some giant earmuffs and places them over the cabin doors. It shakes violently as Russell lunges into a faster rhythm]
Russell Crowe
SHOUT! Think I feel your heartbeat, can you feel mine... lady lookin' lovely, gotta take your love inside, gotta take it...
Tugger
[struggles fiercely] NOOOOO! NOOOOO! [throws its earmuffs off, reaches for a pistol and places it against its smokestack. Tugger fires the gun, and it falls into the water with a splash. Russell stops singing once he hears the gunshot..]
Russell Crowe
[spins around] Tugger! [drops to the edge of the dock and looks down at the water. Tugger is on its side leaking oil] Tugger shot himself!
Announcer
[the show logo pops up] Has Russell lost Tugger for good? Find out after these messages.
Shady Acres TV room.
Cartman
Here we go!
Stan
Commercial Break Number Two! [the boys are positively giddy with anticipation]
Announcer
And now back to Russell Crowe, Fightin' Around The World!
Cartman
That's it? That's all the commercials?
Kyle
They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
Stan
I knew it. They're waiting until the very last commercial break.
Kyle
Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retarded Russell Crowe show!
The Russell Crowe show. Russell Crowe is sobbing on a sofa in a hospital hallway.
Russell Crowe
Tugger! Why'd you do it, Tugger?! [a doctor approaches him] Doctor! Tell me how he is, doctor!
Doctor
Well, he's a very sick little tugboat.
Shady Acres TV room.
Old Man
What is this? We wanna watch "Puppies From Around The World."
Old Woman
Yeah. We don't like this show.
Cartman
Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
The Russell Crowe show.
Russell Crowe
You gotta save him, Doc! Tugger! 'E's my best friend! The only friend in the world who would-
Doctor
He's going to live, but-
Russell Crowe
[lifts the doctor up by the collar] Oi! Don't you interrupt me, you vag-oina! I was givin' a heart-wrenchin' soliloquy about me feelings for Tugger!
Doctor
Sorry.
Russell Crowe
[lets the doctor down and crosses the hall to the opposite wall] Oh, Tugger! Tugger, the world won't be as bright without ya, mate! Give it to me straight, doctor! Will Tugger live?! Tell me the truth!
Doctor
...Now?
Russell Crowe
Yes, now's fine.
Doctor
Oh. Uh, your tugboat's going to be okay. He just needs an oil change and a new steamstack.
Russell Crowe
[quickly brightens and approaches the camera] Ooo, de-lolly! D'you hear that, everybody?! Tugger's gonna be okay! D'you know what that makes me feel like doin'? Foightin'! [turns around and punches the doctor out, then punches a man on crutches out, lifts him up again, and punches him out again.]
Shady Acres TV room.
Old Man
This show is too violent! Put the puppies back on!
Old Folks
Yeah!
Old Woman 2
Please.
Cartman
Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
Old Man 2
All right, that does it! We know how to get our way! Everyone, on the count of three, release your bowels! One! Two! [everyone farts and the boys are astonished.]
The Boys
[bury their noses in their jackets] Awww!
Cartman
Eewww!
Stan
Oh, God, it's horrible! [the boys leave and exit the community]
Shady Acres entrance.
Kyle
That's disgusting, dude!
Cartman
God, I hate old people!
Stan
We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
Butters
I told you, we can't go to my house!
Cartman
And my house is being fumigated!
Stan
Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
The neighborhood. The boys rush to Cartman's house.
Butters
Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys! ...Come on! [Cartman struggles to keep up, blubbering all the while]
Cartman's house and garage, under purple and orange tarps. The boys enter a living room filled with fumigation gas, which makes the room look foggy.
Stan
Turn it on! Turn it on!
The Russell Crowe show.
Russell Crowe
Crikey! Ol' Tugger looks healthy, happy, and [does a catcall] fit as a whistle!
Cartman's living room.
Kyle
It's okay, it's still the show.
The Russell Crowe show.
Russell Crowe
But you know, Tugger's attempted suicide made me realize that I should take up a cause. Most great actors take up causes, and I'm the greatest of 'em all! So, from now on I'm gonna spend all my spare time ...fighting cancer. [gets into a fighting stance] Right! Where is that pussy cancer anyway?!
Cartman's living room. the gas is overwhelming them, and they look ready to pass out.
Kyle
Oh, dude, I don't know how long I can take it.
Stan
Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
Kyle
Will your sister let us watch it?
Stan
She has to! [leads the boys out of Cartman's house]
The neighborhood. The boys rush back to Stan's house.
Stan
Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
Butters
Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...
Cartman
[trailing the other three] Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me! [stops] Oh! I lost a doughnut! [turns around and heads back] Oooh! Oh oh! [stops] Oh my God! [turns around and tries to catch up with the others] Leave no doughnut behind!
Stan's house. The boys reach the front door.
Butters
Oh Jesus! Wait.
Stan
What?
Butters
I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. [the boys are scared now. Slowly, Stan reaches up for the knob and turns it. The door flies open and a torrent of blood gushes through the door, flooding the boys back into the street.]
The Boys
AAAAAAAaaaaaaaahhhhh. [Kyle shakes the blood off, Stan looks up and then at the front door, Butters sits up. A trail of blood is left from the interior of the house to the street, and Shelly looks out from her window]
Shelly
I told you I needed tampons, tuurrddsss!
Kyle
Look! Crack addicts with a television! [two men and a woman are shown watching a small TV on a box near some buildings. The boys walk up to them and watch the TV as well]
The Russell Crowe show. Russell is in a hospital room with Tugger.
Russell Crowe
Well, we couldn't find cancer, but we found a man with cancer. [he walks off and pulls in an old frail man with cancer, then delivers a blow] Take that, cancer! And that! [punches the old man again]
Tugger
Mooot Mooot! [Russell punches the old man behind the head and sends him to the floor]
Stan
The last commercial break has to be coming any second! [two phaser blasts are seen. One kills the bearded crack addict, another knocks a trash can over. Chef's TV appears and the two remaining addicts and the boys scream]
All
AAAAA! [quickly move away. Chef's TV delivers a double blast to the small TV and destroys it, then moves off to its left.]
Chef
[still following the TV and talking to customer service] ...Yes, I pressed "menu" three times! [listens] No! It's givin' me the same error message! [listens] Yes I read the instruction manual!
Luau's Toys, moments later. The boys run by.
The Boys
[stopping] Where do we go?!
Kyle
Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??
Stan
We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
Butters
I'm sure! There's no way!
Kyle
Well why not?!
Butters
Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
Cartman
[glares at Butters and slowly gets angry] Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!
Butters
No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
Kyle
This whole time your TV is in a house with nobody in it?!
Stan
Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! [they run off]
Butters' house, minutes later. The boys burst through the front door.
The Boys
AAAAA!!
Cartman
The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! [Stan is the first to reach the remote control, so he takes it and turn on the TV]
The Russell Crowe show.
Russell Crowe
And so we'll be right back, after these commercials.
Stan
We made it! [grins]
Kyle
The last commercial break is starting!
Announcer
[the show logo appears] Don't go anywhere. Russell Crowe will be right back after a few more commercials. [the grins slowly fade to disappointment]
Cartman
These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
Stan
Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
Kyle
What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
Butters
They have to show it! They promised they would!
Cartman
You guys, calm down. This is what TV shows always do. They make the last commercial break the longest.
Kyle
That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!
Stan
Wait a minute! Look! [points and reads from the TV] "The following preview has..." This is it! This is it!
The Terrance & Phillip trailer.
Announcer
[Terrance & Phillip stand back to back. The camera starts with their legs and pans up] Coming this summer! The greatest Canadian duo of all time is back.
Action music plays as the following words come flying at the viewer from the TV screen: "THIS........ SUMMER........ TERRANCE........ AND........ PHILLIP........ WILL........ BLOW........ YOU........ AWAY........ AND....... WORDS...... WILL..... FLY.... AT... YOU.. VERY. FAST" The music stops and Terrance & Phillip appear dressed as cowboys. Terrance farts, Phillip laughs, then "ASSES OF FIRE" appears with flames behind the words, then a large "2" lands next to the E in FIRE. It is set to come out June 21, 2002. It is rated R. It ends, and the boys take time to absorb it all.
Cartman
[tosses his popcorn into the air] Woohoo!!! [the popcrn showers all the boys as they begin to move around happily]
Stan, Kyle, Butters
Yeeeeesss! [begins dancing]
Stan
That looks AWEsome! [Cartman goes to the phone and starting dialing a number]
Kyle
They were wearing cowboy hats! [to Stan] Did you see?? [to Butters] Did you see?? [Butters stops dancing]
Cartman
[on the phone] Clyde, Clyde? Did you see it? [Stan jumps up on the sofa alongside Cartman] Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
Butters
Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! [picks up some popcorn and toses it up into the air]
Cartman
You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to see.
Stan
Oh, dude, let's go!
Butters
Yeah. [the kids head for the front door]
Kyle
It looks even better than their first movie, huh?
Cartman
Yeah, it sure does!
Stan
I wonder if it's all a western?
Butters
How far away is June?
The Russell Crowe show, sunset. The sun is about to drop over the horizon behind Russell and Tugger.
Russell Crowe
Well, we sure had a good time today, didn't we, kids? We fought some Chinamen, a few peckers, and a lot of Colombians, to name just a few. But I sure am glad we got ol' Wally B. back. Aren't you? [a wallaby hops into view]
Wally B.
I'm glad to be back, Russey! [a woman and girl walk by, but stop and look]
A Girl
Oh my God, it's Russell Crowe!
Russell Crowe
[in the condescending falsetto] Oh my God it's Russell Crowe! Oh my bluh blah bluh!! [gets into his fighting stance] Why don't you go flush yourself down a toilet, you cu- [the girl's mother picks her up and hurries away]
Tugger
Mooo-oooo.
Russell Crowe
[puts his hand to his ear and gasps] Uh-oh, Tugger's whistle. You know what that means!
[the wallaby hops to the boat as Russell backs away from the camera. He begins to sing as Wally B. turns around...]
Tugger's whistle's blowin' 
Means we must be goin' 
No more Russell Crowein' for you.
[does some boxing moves and then hops into the boat]
But now don't you start to whine
I'll see ya again next time.
'Cause there's plenty a-more a-fightin' left to do.
[Wally B. hops closer, and finally into Russell's arms. Next shot, a departing Tugger, headed for the sunset. Russell appears and sings the signature line, slowing with every word]
Makin' movies, makin' songs, an' fightin' round the world.
See you next time, everybody!
[waves to the camera]

South Park, night. Chef's TV is still walking around, but this time away from town. It's showing the Russell Crowe show. Chef is still trying to shut it down.
Chef
So I'm supposed to press "menu," then "function," then "enter."
End of The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer

Professor Chaos
Cartman's room, day. Cartman and Kyle stand inside watching Stan, who is peeking out the door, waiting for someone.
Stan
[turns to the boys] Okay, here he comes. [join Cartman and Kyle]
Kyle
Who wants to tell him?
Cartman
I'll do it.
Butters
[joining the three] Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
Cartman
Butters, could you take a seat, please?
Butters
Wuh well, sure. [They all go before Cartman's desk. Cartman takes a seat behind the desk. Stan helps Butters to his seat, then takes a place at Cartman's right side Kyle is on Cartman's left.]
Cartman
Butters, we have to have a very difficult conversation.
Butters
Wull what is it?
Cartman
Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap," so to speak. [wiggles the index and middle fingers of each hand as a quote gesture]
Butters
Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
Cartman
Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
Butters
Not working out?
Cartman
I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
Kyle
Lame.
Cartman
Lame, yes.
Butters
Well, but ah I can get better.
Stan
Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you look for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
Kyle
But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
Butters
Huh but ah I thought we were gettin' along... great. Heh ah I thought we were really havin' fun together.
Cartman
Yes, well, we weren't.
Butters
Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.
Kyle
We're sorry, Butters. [Cartman leaves his chair and approaches Butters] Our mind is made up.
Cartman
[shakes Butters' left hand] But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by. [points to the door] You know the way out, right? [Butters look at the other two boys, who each returns a somber look. He gets off the chair, looks once more, then walks away dejectedly]
Kyle
Phew.
Stan, Cartman
Phew.
Kyle
Hm, he took that pretty well, I think.
Cartman
Who cares?
Stan
All right, so let's get started on who's gonna be the new person to take Kenny's place.
Butters' house, night. A thunderstorm hovers over the neighborhood. Inside Butters' room a hamster set is seen, and beyond, Butters standing on his bed, looking out his window. He has an angry expression on his face.
Butters
[angrily] The world isn't fair. I do everything people ask me to. I stand in the lunch line for them, I buy tampons at the store for them, I go on Maury Povich with balls on my chin for them. [turns around and sits on his bed, wistfully] And yet, nobody accepts me. I am an outcast. A shadow of a man who can find no companion... ship. No love from others. [the shadow on the wall turns into that of an old humpbacked man] Fine! [hops off the bed determined to do something about it] If I am to be an outcast, so be it! [walks towards the camera] I'm through doin' what others tell me to do, and I am sick of this world and the stin-, and the stinky people in it! [moves to his left] From now on I will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me! [an image of a nuclear blast going off as people run from it] I will become the greatest supervillain [people run as danger comes from the sky] the world has ever seen! [a tsunami takes over a harbor town as a woman and baby flee it] Where I go, destruction will follow! [exults at his new destiny, raising arms and face towards heaven as lightning strikes. A shot of the exterior with more lightning]
Butters goes about making a suit for himself. He begins with a sheet of aluminum foil and shapes it around a styrofoam head to make a helmet. He pulls out a shirt from the closet and makes it a cape using a sewing machine. Pretty soon, he's finished - he's dressed as something of a knight.
Butters
Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! [grins devilishly]
Linda
[knocking on Butters' door] Butters, time for bed.
Butters
Hu-uh, okay Mom. [waits a few moments, then gets that devilish look again.] Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now. [turns and faces the camera out side once more] Tomorrow, the chaos begins. [begins to laugh softly, then harder, than more maniacally, then in full maniacal laughter]
South Park, morning. A small stage is shown in Cartman's backyard, with a camera off to the side. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman walk up on stage and look out over the backyard.
Cartman
[takes the mic] All right, we wanna thank everybody for coming. This is a great turnout. [camera pans across the seated kids, then back to Cartman] Uh, as you know, our friend Kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend. Now, you've all been selected as possible candidates, but unfortunately, there is only room for one of you. So Stan and Kyle and I will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down. Until we think we've found the perfect friend. Are there any questions?
Clyde
[after a moment of silence] ...What if we don't want to be your friend?
Cartman
Clyde... [mouths something]... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.
South Park, later. The camera looks at the end of Main Street, and Butters comes over a bump on the street. He heads towards the camera right in the middle of the street as the adults around him talk or window-shop. He walks on, and a Bennigan's appears to his left. He turns to look at it, then runs through the front doors. He stops just inside. The diners go about eating and chatting. A waitress serves a table.
Bennigan's Chef
Order twenty-three is up, and uh, order twenty-four is up. [presses down on a bell twice.]
Butters sees the dishes and walks up to them. He stares at them for a few seconds, then switches them, grinning evilly. He then drops down quickly as a waitress comes for the dishes. She delivers them to the two diners who ordered them.
Man 1
Uh, waitress, a-a-actually, I ordered the chicken soup. This is minestrone.
Man 2
Yeah, I had the minestrone over here. [Butters laughs at his own cleverness. The diners look at him]
Butters
I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! [cackles once again and runs out of the restaurant. The diners resume their eating after a few seconds.]
Montage 1 - A Day At The Amusement Park.
Stan
[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends. [cut to Stan seated on a green sofa under a spotlight] It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
Cartman
[on a blue sofa] I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. [cut to Jimmy entertaining Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, Clyde, and Craig]
Jimmy
[cut to Jimmy on a dark green sofa] Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?
Kyle
[seated on a cyan sofa] Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
Tweek
[sipping coffee, shaking violently] What if they don't pick me? What if they get us all, man! I mean, Christ! If they can get to the Pentagon, then they can get to us all, man! Aaaa!
DogPoo Petuski
[a shot of the kids on the mine track ride, DogPoo in front with Cartman. Cut to the dirty boy who resembles Pigpen seated on a red sofa] I think I deserve to take Kenny's place the most, because, I've been hanging around these guys for like five years and I never get to say or do anything.
Cartman
...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. [takes a sip of ZOOP soda]
Kyle
[a shot of Kyle, Cartman, Tweek, and Towelie in a spinning teacup] Towelie is a tough choice because, [cut to Kyle talking] even though I can see how always having a towel around can come in handy, he's just always so high.
Towelie
[17 in towel years] Man, I really hope I win, because... wait... what is this again? I have no idea what's goin' on.
Cartman
We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride. [cut to the log ride] The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line. [the boys are escorted to the first car, cut back to Cartman] That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...
Jimmy
[back at the ride. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman climb into the log] Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.
Ride Operator
O! Shut her down. Someone needs assistance.
Cartman
[the boys look at Jimmy] Oh, really? [turns to his note pad] That's gonna cost some points. [writes down some numbers as Jimmy is helped into the log.]
Kyle
[on the sofa] But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell lame jokes.
Jimmy
[cut to log ride. The boys are about to slide down the track] Boy, isn't this great fellas? Are we great pals or what?
Stan
[voice over a scene of all the kids walking down Main Street at the amusement park] One thing for sure: picking our new friend isn't gonna be easy.
South Park, day. Butters is still dressed as Professor Chaos, still walking down the street. A dog walks across the street and Butters stops next to it.
Butters
Kneel. Kneel before Professor Chaos! [the dog slowly kneels and Butters walks off cackling at his success]
Butters' house, later. He makes it to his room and locks the door. He cackles again.
Butters
Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos! [walks up to his dresser drawer and messes up some shirts in there, then closes the drawer and laughs] And that's only the beginning! [laughs evilly]
Cartman's backyard, day. All the kids are seated as they were yesterday. A box of roses sits on stage.
Cartman
All right, everyone. It was a tough decision, but based on our time with you all at the amusement park, we have whittled our choices down to ten. [Kyle goes off to get the box of roses] If you receive a rose, please stay. If you don't, get the fudge out. [Kyle returns with the roses and sets them down] Kyle, will you announce the people we want to stay?
Kyle
[holds up a rose for every kid he calls] Token. [Token approaches, gets his rose and goes back to his seat] Clyde. [Clyde goes for his rose] Craig. [Craig goes for his rose] Timmy.
Timmy
Timmih! [goes for his rose]
Tweek
Oh man! This is too much pressure!
Kyle
Pip. [Pip smiles and goes for his rose] Jimmy. [Jimmy goes for his rose] Jason. [a new boy with high forehead, goes for his rose] Towelie. [Towelie goes for his rose] Luigi. [Luigi goes for his rose].
Cartman
Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
Kyle
Tweek.
Tweek
Aaarr! [goes for his rose]
Cartman
All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! [the others moan and leave their seats]
DogPoo
[incredulous] I didn't make the cut?? Oh God, I didn't make the cut??
Dougie
I didn't even get a chance to have them get to know me!
Stan
All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny. [the camera pans over the remaining candidates] Good luck.
South Park, morning. Butters' house, kitchen. Linda is preparing some breakfast and Butters comes in confidently.
Linda
Good morning, Butters.
Butters
[takes a a seat at the table] It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order at Bennigan's.
Linda
No, [Butters blanches] I didn't hear about that.
Butters
Yeh, you didn't? [leaves his seat and walks to the living room]
Butters' house, living room. Butters walks up to Chris, who is on the sofa reading the newspaper.
Butters
Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
Stephen
[lowers the newspaper] Why sure, Butters. I was just about to get some breakfast. [hands the paper to Butters, who sets it down on the floor and looks for headlines. The front page doesn't offer anything he's looking for, so he turns the page.]
Butters
[getting mad] Nothing. [turns the next page] Nothing! [closes the paper and stands up] It's the liberal media! They're keeping the stories of my deeds covered up, so as not to cause a panic. Well, I guess it's time to step it up a notch! [makes two fists signaling his stepped-up efforts]
The bus stop, later. Stan, Kyle and Cartman stand with Craig. Scene music plays.
Stan
Okay, next? [signals for Craig to leave. Craig walks away and Token comes in to take his place. Scene music plays. A few moments for the boys to get a feel for Token]
Kyle
This looks pretty good.
Stan
Yeah, it's not bad. Next? [Signals for Token to leave. Token walks away and Timmy rides in to take his place. Scene music plays.]
Timmy
Timmay!
Cartman
Next?
South Park Elementary, day. Most of the class is present. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stand at the front of the class. On the chalkboard is the times table for 4.
Cartman
Okay, so now we're gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime. Your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers. So good luck, everybody.
Ms. Choksondik
[entering] Sit down, boys.
Cartman
Alrighty then. [the boys take their seats]
Ms. Choksondik
All right, children, before we get started, has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard? [a shot of the class, then of Butters. A sneer comes to his face as he laughs to himself. The room darkens around him and a shadow appears on the lower part of his face] It probably got knocked on the floor somewhere. Can you all just please look around your desks for it? [the kids drop from their seats and look around. The sneer is back on Butters' face and the shadow returns]
Butters
[thinking] Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth. [a shot of Butters using a shovel to bury the eraser] And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser. [Butters' desk moves around so the camera can see the kids looking for the eraser] And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! [the times table floats behind Butters and gets all jumbled up as he speaks, finally ending in a kid whose brains blow out of his head]
Ms. Choksondik
No? Oh, oh well. Never mind. I've got a backup one in the desk. [opens a drawer, takes out an eraser and erases the times table on the board] Okay, today children, we're gonna learn about multiplying times five.
Butters
[thwarted, begins to think again. The people around him take on their picture-negative counterparts] So! You all think that you can outsmart Professor Chaos, do you?!
Ms. Choksondik
Now, whenever we multiply a number times five, the result is going to end in a zero or a five.
Butters
Ms. Choksondik?
Ms. Choksondik
[turns around] What is it, Butters?
Butters
Ah, I need to go to the bathroom. R-really bad.
Ms. Choksondik
Oh alright Butters. Take the bathroom pass and go. [Butters gets off his seat and heads for the door. He takes the pass from the pegboard] Okay, so for instance, children-
Butters
[opens the door, then looks back] Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
Ms. Choksondik
Just go, Butters. [Butters smiles and leaves] Okay, so for instance, five times one is... what, Eric?
Cartman
Uh, what's the question again?
Ms. Choksondik
[holds out the five fingers on her right hand] Five... times... [holds out the index finger on her left hand] one.
Cartman
Five times one is of course...
The Class
[minus Cartman, Stan, and Kyle] Five.
Cartman
Five. [the door opens and Professor Chaos appears]
Butters
[enters cackling] The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! [approaches Ms. Choksondik]
Ms. Choksondik
Who are you?
Butters
I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! [turns, takes the other eraser, and walks out cackling, closing the door. The class just looks at the door]
Ms. Choksondik
Hey! That kid took my last eraser! [heads for the door] Come back here, kid! [as she reaches the door, it opens and Butters enters]
Butters
Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
Ms. Choksondik
Butters, did you see another little kid run out of here?
Butters
Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow. [raises his right elbow] Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look. [as Ms. Choksondik looks at the elbow, the shadow and sneer return to Butters' face. He begins to think] Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
Ms. Choksondik
It looks fine, Butters. [rises and addresses the class] Okay, hold on and stay here, children. [leaves the classroom. Butters sneers again]
South Park Elementary, later. Recess. The kids are at play. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Craig are standing together.
Kyle
You're such a fatass, Cartman!
Cartman
Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
Stan
Shut up, fatass! [silence. They look at Craig and the anger fades from their faces as they wait for him to respond]
Craig
Oh, aaaah, well you guys are dumb.
Cartman
[escorts Craig away] Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. [Craig leaves]
Butters' house, night. Butters is at his desk working with his hamster set.
Butters
It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world. [puts glue on some aluminum, puts the aluminum on a hamster] There we go. [the hamsters will be armored, as he is. He places the hamster back in the cage] Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos. [the hamsters begin to make noise] Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon. [the door opens and Butters quickly throws a blanket over his hamster cage] Aaahhh!
Linda
[Linda walks in and towards his desk] Butters, a note for you was left on the front door.
Butters
A note?
Linda
Here you go. [gives it to him and walks out] And wash your hands after you touch those hamsters - you'll get AIDS. [exits and closes the door]
Butters
Okay, Mom. [takes a look at the envelope, spins around in his chair, and opens the envelope. He reads the letter within: "I know who you are. The South Park Docks. 7:30. Tonight"] So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions! [pulls off the blanket] We haven't much time!
Cartman's backyard, night. Stan, Kyle and Cartman are on stage for the next round of elimination.
Cartman
All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
Pip
They're not going to pick me. I just know they're not.
Tweek
O-oh Jesus! Aaah I can't take it!
Kyle
[as before, holds up a rose for every name] Token.
Token
All right! [goes for his rose]
Kyle
Timmy.
Timmy
Timmay! [goes for his rose]
Kyle
Tweek. [Tweek goes for his rose] Pip.
Pip
Really? I don't believe it. [goes for his rose]
Kyle
Towelie.
Towelie
What?
Cartman
Just one more rose, Kyle.
Kyle
Jimmy.
Jimmy
Oh boy! Oh thank God! [goes for his rose]
Cartman
All right, those with roses will move on to the swimsuit and talent competition. The rest of you, get the fudge out! [Craig, Clyde, Jason, and Luigi leave]
Clyde
[turns and looks at Cartman] This whole thing is stupid! You don't pick people you wanna be with by making it into a game!
Cartman
Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, "get the fudge out!" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
South Park docks, night. Under a red moon, Butters sneaks along the docks, making sure no one sees him. He creeps from box to box and peeks out from behind one. Another face peeks out from behind a box at the other end of the docks. This face is younger, with glasses.
Dougie
[steps out] Hey Butters.
Butters
[drops his guard and steps out] Oh, hey Dougie. [gets into character] Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
Dougie
I saw you change in the school bathroom. You stole that eraser in your class.
Butters
Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise! [pulls out two hamsters from his pockets and sets them down] Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down! [the hamsters head back towards shore] Aw minions, naw, not that way. He- [turns to see them leave] come back minions.
Dougie
I'm, not trying to call you out, Professor Chaos. I want to join you.
Butters
Join me?
Dougie
Yeah I want to join you in your conquest of destruction.
Butters
But why?
Dougie
[approaching] I'm an outcast, too. A frail child cast aside by society. I want to follow you and... whatever you're doing.
Butters
Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
Dougie
Do I get a neato costume made out of aluminum foil, too?
Butters
Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
Dougie
General Disarray.
Butters
Now let us go look for my minions! [softly] They ran away here, now to find 'em... [the new villainous duo search the docks for the hamsters]
Montage 2 - The Swimsuit And Talent Competition. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit on the chairs in the audience. The six remaining candidates are on stage.
Cartman
[a shot of him on a sofa] The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. [a shot of the three boys making comments during judging. Cartman takes notes]
Jimmy
[on a sofa] Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really be my chance to... shine. [cut to Cartman's house den for the competition. Jimmy's doing his comedy routine] Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh... [a shot of the three boys getting bored] A guy walks into a guy walks into a [goes into a sing-song mode] babuh ba-a-a, uh- [next, Towelie playing an electric guitar - "Stairway To Heaven" - but messes up]
Towelie
Okay wait... [starts over, but messes up. The boys are bored again] No, no wait. [tries again]
Cartman
Next please.
Token
[takes the mic] Well, what am I supposed to do?
Kyle
Anything that'll impress us, Token.
Cartman
If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
Token
Aaaah. Oh, I know. [takes his shirt and ties it into a knot between his breasts, then begins to shake his butt, giving the impression of a hula girl]
Cartman
Very nice. [takes notes]
Stan
I like it. [takes notes]
Kyle
[back to recap] Well Token was a definite winner of the talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
Coors Field in Denver. The game is underway. A shot of the field.
Announcer
There goes a hit to left field, and Foley's going to score.
The bleachers. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Pip sit and watch the game.
All
Woohoo!
Kyle
Yeah! Isn't this great?!
Vendor
[making his way down the steps] Drinks! Get your drinks here.
Pip
Eho! Yes. Can I have some tea, please?
Cartman
You don't drink tea at a baseball game, you French piece of crap!
Pip
Oh, very well. Just some crumpets, then.
Cartman
All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! [Pip leaves his seat and Token comes in]
Stan
Okay, let's try this. [a shot of the field. The Jumbotron at center field loses focus and glimpses of Professor Chaos are seen]
Cartman
Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
Butters
People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos, [Dougie comes into view] and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my final Labor of Loathing! I am going to... flood... the world!
Man 3
Flood the world?
Man 4
My God!
Woman
[grabs onto someone] I don't wanna die, [screams] I DON'T WANNA DIE!
Butters
Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth! [Dougie goes to the faucet by the porch and turns it on, then brings the hose to Butters. Butters addresses the world] You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! [points at the pool of water now forming on the ground. The crowd watches in silence]
Man 5
Dear Christ, who will save us?
Man 6
We have very little time to live. How, how shall we spend our last hours on earth? [the crowd stops and reflects...]
Fans
Yeah! All right! [everyone takes off their clothes and celebrates in their underwear]
Butters' house, day. Butters and Dougie are in the back yard watching their puddle grow and grow.
Butters
Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle! [the two of them watch the hose yield its water, seemingly slowly] Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? [Dougie goes to look, then returns]
Dougie
It's on all the way.
Butters
Oh. Alright then. Nothing to do now but watch the world die! [cackles and dances around, then resumes watching the puddle grow. Day fades to night] Boy, this sure is takin' a long time.
Stan's house, dining room. The three boys sit at the table with pictures of the six candidates. They discuss their findings.
Stan
Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? [holds up Towelie's picture]
Cartman
I think Towelie is awesome.
Kyle
Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
Stan
[weary] Oh, this is giving me a headache.
Kyle
Eh now, [pounds the table with his fist] come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
Stan
[acquiescing] You're right. Well now, how about Timmy? [holds up Timmy's picture] He's quiet and he takes direction well. Really the perfect friend.
Cartman
Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
Stan
How about Token? [holds up Token's picture]
Cartman
Token's a smartass.
Kyle
So? You're a smartass!
Cartman
Yeah. Do we really need another one?
Kyle
Good point. [Stan sets the picture down. A door opens]
Jimmy
[approaches the table] Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
Cartman
[disgusted] Oh, thanks Jimmy.
Jimmy
There's some chocolates and lih-liquorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside.
Stan
That's great.
Kyle
Cool.
Jimmy
Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later. [leaves]
Cartman
Alright Jimmy, see ya. [the door closes]
Stan
Suckup.
Butters' house, next day, backyard. The pool has covered much of the yard. General Disarray jumps in the water as Professor Chaos looks on passively on the porch.
Butters
Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
Dougie
Hey, do you think maybe we should build a boat? You know, like a little raft or something, so that when the world floods you and me and the minions can live?
Butters
Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer. [the sound of vehicles screeching to a stop outside the yard] Hey, who is that? [on the street, two Water Department vans come to a stop. Four men, two from each van, step out and get their tools. They enter the yard and approach the hose]
Worker 1
Is this it?
Worker 2
Yeah, two thirteen, that's the one. [Worker 1 proceeds to close the faucet]
Butters
Heeyyy, what are you doin'? [Worker 1 finishes and the workers leave, climb into their vans, and drive off. Professor Chaos and General Disarray look on in sad disbelief. Suddenly, Butters flares up] Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
Dougie
What do we do now?
Butters
[softly, pensive] Well I had another idea of how to kill the world, but I thought it was... almost too horrible to e- to even speak of, but- [with anger growing] but now they have left me with no other choice!
Cartman's backyard, day. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are on stage while the candidates sit in the audience. Pip is missing.
Cartman
Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. [the camera pans across the audience, showing the candidates close-up]
Jimmy
Oh puh please. Oh, Oh God... please. [Timmy just grins. Kyle draws the last rose from the box.]
Cartman
Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? [another shot of the candidates]
A hilltop, later. Butters reaches the top of a hill carrying a box, with a red sky above him. He sets the box down.
Butters
This is it, General Disarray. My final solution. [cut to a view of the town from said hill. ]
Dougie
[catches up] What evil plot do you have this time, Professor Chaos?
Butters
Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays! [reaches into the box and withdraws a spray can] Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos! [begins spraying away. The can empties without discernible effect, and Butters tosses it down] Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. [Dougie reaches in the box and takes out three cans. He gives one to Butters and keeps the other two. Butters quickly opens the can and sprays away, cackling all the while. Dougie opens his two cans and begins spraying as well, cackling along with Butters. The camera begins to zoom out]
Announcer
Will Professor Chaos's latest plot succeed and be the final undoing of Earth? [a shot of Stan, Cartman, Kyle, and the fourth boy under a blanket, all in Stan's living room] And which boy has been chosen to be the replacement for Kenny? [six adults are then shown: Chef, Mr. Garrison, Jimbo, Officer Barbrady, Ms. Choksondik, and Mayor McDaniels] And which of these six South Park residents was killed, and will never be seen again? [a question mark appears on screen] The answer to those questions will be answered... right now. [A final shot of Butters and Dougie with ten spent cans and three in use] No. [Stan's living room: the blanket comes off the fourth boy] Tweek. [on the street, in front of a house: Ms. Choksondik is on a gurney as paramedics cover her body with a blanket] Ms. Choksondik.
End of Professor Chaos

The Simpsons Already Did It
Kyle's house, day. Stan and Kyle are happily preparing a snowman, which now has twigs, buttons, a hat and scarf. Tweek stands behind Stan holding a carrot.
Stan
Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. [Tweek moves forward, but then backs up. Stan rises and turns to Tweek]
Tweek
I can't. [presents the carrot] You do it.
Kyle
Just stick it on.
Tweek
But what if I put it in the wrong place?
Stan
Just put it between its eyes.
Tweek
GARH. But what if, while I'm putting on the nose, the snowman comes to life and tries to kill me?
Stan
Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
Kyle
Yeah.
Butters
[happens by and waves] Hey, fellas.
Stan
[flatly] Oh, hey Butters.
Butters
How are things... going with your new best friend?
Kyle
[walks up to Tweek] Well, Tweek's okay, but he's certainly no Kenny! [takes the carrot from Tweek's hand]
Tweek
Arrrr!
Stan
Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
Kyle
Yeah.
Butters
Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. [takes his leave, screen left. Stan and Kyle resume work on the snowman]
Tweek
Oh man, that is waaay too much pressure! [Kyle puts the carrot in place]
Cartman
[off screen. Stan and Kyle look] You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! [excited, he rushes up and stands between then, holding an ad]
Stan
Uh oh.
Cartman
Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
Tweek
It's not?
Cartman
No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
Kyle
No way.
Cartman
Look! [the boys draw close. The ad is shown] Sea people. You keep them under a big tank of water and they like, build castles and play basketball and stuff.
Kyle
Nuh uh.
Cartman
Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
Kyle
No way.
Cartman
[shows irritation] Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on. [turns to Stan and Tweek and continues excitedly] Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
Kyle
Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. [Cartman's smile vanishes and he shuts his eyes.]
Cartman
If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
Stan
Alright, I'll chip in.
Tweek
Gah! Me too.
Kyle
[resigned] Ah, alright.
Butters' house, day. He reaches his room.
Linda
Butters! Don't forget: dinner is in two hours!
Butters
[in the doorway] Wokay, mom. Ah I'm just gonna be up here, uh doin' my homework. [he enters and closes the door behind him. His evil face shows] Yes. By day he is mild-mannered, sweet, and innocent Butters BUT... [runs to his closet and opens the sliding door, then steps inside] nobody knows that he actually has a dark underside... [slides the door shut and changes clothes. He slides the door open and comes out dressed as] Professor Chaos! Haha! Time to wreak havoc on the world that shunned me! [runs to his window, opens it, and jumps out. He skulks through the woods nearby with an easel. He reaches a clearing and sets up the easel. General Disarray shows up pulling a wagon of firewood]
Dougie
Professor Chaos!
Butters
Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
Dougie
I have done as you asked and brought the first load of scrap wood.
Butters
Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. [EVIL PLOT #4-B]
Dougie
What dastardly deed are we doing now?
Butters
Simple, my dear general. [flips the page over to show a drawing of the town with a huge shade over the town, held up by a tall pillar] We are going to block out the sun!
Dougie
[looking at the picture] Oh. [turns around]
Butters
Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide [a hamster peers from the wood and drops back down again], precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
Dougie
Oh, awesome!
Butters
Soon, all people will have to live like moles! They will love only to remember with sorrow how great the sun used to be! [laughs with evil glee]
Dougie
Cool. It'll be just like on the Simpsons. [Butters stops laughing and freezes in place]
Butters
[tilts his head forward] Huh?
Dougie
They did that on the Simpsons. I think it was the Mr. Burns character. He tried to block Springfield from the sun.
Butters
He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
Dougie
So how do we build it?
Butters
Aww, I don't wanna do it now [drops his hammer], not if they already did it on the Simpsons. [walks off dejected] I have to think of something else. [they walk through the woods] Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
Cartman's house, night. The living room light is on. Cartman is sleeping, dreaming...
Cartman
Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow... [bubbles appear as Cartman dreams] Yesss... Yeesss...
The dream sequence.
Cartman
[shown floating down to the briny deep. Two pairs of sea arms catch him. The sea couple rights him and walk with him in the middle]
Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
[the sea couple and he sail by in a tiny pirate ship. They take him into the castle]
We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
[A sea man pitches to Cartman, who bats the ball for a run. As a sea family looks on he blows out the candles on a cake.]
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
[he rides a sea horse alongside sea people on horseback and grins at the camera]
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
[Shown walking with the sea couple again.]
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.

The dream ends and the bubbles fade away. Cartman wakes up, smiling.
Cartman
Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people. [closes his eyes and turns to his left side] Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. [goes to sleep]
Cartman's house, day. He's at his desk with the new kit while Stan, Kyle, and Tweek stand behind him. His dressed as a monarch, in suit, crown and cape.
Cartman
Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says [slowing down to read] "Step 2. [grabs a small sack] Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly." [smiles, then remembers something. He turns to face the other boys] Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?
Stan
Ready. Let's see 'em.
Cartman
[turns to the tank] Hold the sign up, Kyle! [Kyle picks a sign up off the floor and holds it to his chest] Higher, Kyle! [Kyle raises it higher, in front of his face] Okay. [opens the egg sack and whispers] Here we go. [pours the eggs into the tank and taps the bag for good measure. Kyle moves the sign a bit so he could peek. Cartman grins again in anticipation, but it fades. Kyle lowers the sign to his chest. Cartman looks from various angles, then takes out the magnifying glass for a closer look. Two pale shrimp crawl around in the tank. Kyle drops the sign]
Stan
Are they playing basketball? [Cartman picks up the box and looks at the front. A close-up of a sea couple. Cartman looks in the tank and sees just shrimp. He looks displeased, Kyle has the sign in hand again]
Cartman
What the fuck is this?! [Stan approaches and looks in the tank]
Stan
Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
Cartman
I got RIPPED OFF! [pounds the desk and sets the box on the floor to his left]
Kyle
I told you, Cartman.
Cartman
[approaches Kyle and confronts him] Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!! [moves on to Tweek] And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!! [his rant ended, he walks across the room] They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep.
Tweek
[shaking] They package brine shrimp and sell them to kids? That's not right, man!
Stan
What are we gonna do with them?
Cartman
[at the window] Who cares?! Throw 'em away!!
Kyle
[approaches the tank] Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
Stan
Yeah, that'd be funny.
Cartman
[brightly] Heheh, okay, okay.
Next day, Ms. Choksondik's house. The scene from last episode is carried on here, only zoomed out. The paramedics take Ms. Choksondik's corpse into the ambulance as a crowd looks on. The adults murmur amongst themselves. The ambulance pulls away and Cartman pulls the other boys in with some urgency.
Cartman
Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
Tweek
[blurts out] Jesus Christ, we killed her!
Cartman
[rushes to Tweek and covers his mouth] Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
Dougie's house. He's doing homework on the living room coffee table when a doorbell rings. He goes to answer it. He opens the door and Butters steps in with something under wraps.
Butters
General Disarray, are your parents home?
Dougie
No.
Butters
Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
Dougie
What?
Butters
You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head! [pulls the cover off and laughs maniacally] Hahahahaa, yeah!
Dougie
Oh, uh...
Butters
Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! [turns on the TV]
News Anchor
... but Hillary Clinton's ass just keeps getting bigger. [the image in the small box changes from Hillary to that of the decapitated statue] Also in the news tonight, a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the Powell statue in the South Park Town Square.
Butters
Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
News Anchor
The head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads.
Butters
I finally made the world sorry! I've brought sadness, a-and chaos!
News Anchor
This act, of course, reminded us all of the time that Bart Simpson [a picture of him appears in the box] took the head of the Springfield statue in one of their classic episodes. Here's what some people had to say:
Man 1
Well, I, I think whoever took the head was... really just doing an homage to the Simpsons. [laughs] Heh, I think it's great.
Woman
Yes, it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh.
Man 2
Well the Simpsons is such a great show, and we need reminders like this to keep us watching.
Butters
Oh. Uh-m, son of a bitch.
News Anchor
The police say that instead of looking for the missing head, they'd rather leave it off and be reminded of the Simpsons every day.
Butters
Well why didn't you tell me the Simpsons already did that?
Dougie
You seemed so proud, I didn't wanna bum you out.
Butters
[walks away hanging his head] Stupid Simpsons...
Kyle's house, night. The boys watch TV on the sofa.
Terrance
Hello there, Phillip. I brought you something.
Phillip
Oh, what is it? [Terrance farts and Phillip comments, but the boys talk over him]
Kyle
See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
Tweek
Jesus Christ, she's dead!!
Stan
Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
Terrance
Phillip, I think I may have accidentally killed Celine Dion.
Phillip
[gasps] Killing is never an accident, you dickface! [farts, and the two of them crack up]
Stan
Oh jeez, change the channel.
News Anchor
And in other news, still no cause of death found for elementary school teacher Diane Choksondik. However, doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach. [there's a pause and the boys look aghast]
Stan
They found the sea men! It's only a matter of time before they find the women, too!
News Anchor
The autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined.
Kyle
Oh God!
Stan
We're dead!
Tweek
Oh Jesus! [moves off the couch] That's it, man! I want nothing more to do with you guys!
Cartman
Tweek! Where are you going?
Tweek
They're gonna find you out! Then when they do I don't wanna be within fifty feet of you! You're gonna fry, man!
Stan
Hey, Tweek, you're in this just as much as we are!
Tweek
What?! I told you NOT to put the sea people in her coffee! I wasn't even there when you did it!
Kyle
Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
Cartman
In fact, that makes you the most responsible. Tweek, you might have to take the fall on this one.
Tweek
Rrrr-hr-hrrr!!!
Chef's house, night. The boys arrive at his house and ring the bell. He opens the door and sees them.
Chef
Oh, well, hello there, children.
Stan
Chef, we did something kind of bad.
Kyle
We don't know who else to talk to.
Chef
Ohh, I'm sure your little cracker problems ain't all that bad. Come on in. [the boys enter and Chef leads them to the sofa] Now, just sit down and take a deep breath and tell ol' Chef what's goin' on.
Stan
[pause] We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
Chef
Now, children, every problem can be worked out. What was it?
Stan
We... killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach.
Chef
...Oh, children, that's a problem we all have to face at one time or another. Here: let me sing you a little song that might cheer you up. Sometimes you kill your teacher and they find your semen in her stomach, and uh Wait! What the what?!
Stan
[beat] So what should we do? [Chef thinks, then goes and pushes the sofa towards the door and onto the entry path]
Kyle
Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
Cartman
We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
Tweek
Gnaaahahahah! [pulls on his hair and looks at his fist] I pulled out my hair!
Dougie's house, night. In the living room Butters begins to pitch ideas.
Butters
Wokay, how about this, Dougie? [backs up to the easel. On it is the schematic to plan #123-D] I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money. [Dougie just looks back] No?
Dougie
...Simpsons did it. They did it in episode 204.
Butters
Wokay [flips to the next page to show #124-A], then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumors about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
Dougie
Simpsons did it!
Butters
[flips to plan #129-E] I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
Dougie
Simpsons did it!
Hell's Pass Hospital, night. Cartman leads the other boys into the coroner's office.
Stan
This is it.
Cartman
Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
Tweek
Hammertime? Can't the code word just be... "lookout"? I won't remember "Hammertime"!
Cartman
[whispers] Ugh. [then] Just remember the song "Can't Touch This" and you'll remember the code word!
Stan
Yeah, stupid.
Tweek
Oh, God. [the boys split up. Tweek goes to the door ajar and steps out, Kyle to a table to the right, Cartman to a table to the left, Stan to the supply closet. Cartman opens the doors under his table and looks around, then goes to Kyle's table to check out the drawers there.]
Kyle
[takes a wide covered beaker and look in it] There's nothing here! [puts it back and Stan approaches]
Stan
Dude, it's probably still in her stomach. [Kyle approaches the corpse in the middle of the room and pulls back the cover. Ms. Choksondik's chest and abdomen have been cut open right down the front]
Cartman
Is it her?
Kyle
Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.
Stan
What do we do now?
Cartman
Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach! [the boys look at him, shocked] Oh, God! You guys are such pussies! [starts digging around in the belly] Hemmm...
Tweek
[voices are heard; he rushes back in] Erm! Hff. You gu-guys! Ha... Hamme- [covers his mouth] I can't remember uh-the code word!
Stan
Do you see the sea people.
Cartman
No, just a bunch of goo.
Tweek
[hushed tones. Shadows appear down the hall and move towards the room] You guys! Um, dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this.
Kyle
Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. [covers his nose]
Stan
Yeah.
Tweek
[two people come down the hall] ...dumdum, dumdum. Can't touch this. Dum dumdumdum, dumdum, then stop. HAMMERTIME!
Stan
Aaah!
Kyle
Quick. Hide. [the boys disperse. Stan runs to the closet he looked in earlier, Kyle to one on the opposite side, Tweek behind the door]
Voice
[outside] Yeah, well, at least we got Shannon Sharp back. [Cartman burrows his way into Ms. Choksondik's corpse]
Doctor 1
Alright, let's just leave the semen sample next to the corpse; I wanna run a hair fiber test next. [snips a piece of hair off and turns around. They both walk back out]
Doctor 2
Hey, do you smell children?
Doctor 1
No, that's not... [voice fades. The doctors leave and the boys come out of their hiding places. Cartman is still in the corpse]
Kyle
Got it!
Stan
Let's go! [He, Kyle, and Tweek head out the door quickly. Cartman pops out of Ms. Choksondik's corpse gasping for air]
Butters house, later that night. Butters presents plan #127-C.
Butters
Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
Dougie
Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
Butters
[flips to plan #125-E] Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
Dougie
Episode 9F17 entitled "So It's Come To This!"
Butters
[seethes for a few seconds] Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! [sits down next to Dougie]
Dougie
...Simpsons did it.
Butters
Dwaah!!
Cartman's house, later. In his room he takes the semen sample and pours it into his tank, tapping the rim of the tank so the semen can start moving. The semen slides into the tank and puts the lid back on.
Cartman
There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know. [looks at his hands] The blood is washed neatly from our hands. [the door opens and Chef enters with a bunch of stuff.]
Chef
Alright, children, I got you four tickets to Thailand [in his right hand, with a sports bag] and three hundred dollars cash [inside the suitcase in his left hand]. It's gonna be tough living for a while. You might have to do things for money you never thought of doin' before.
Cartman
[stopping Chef] It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
Chef
[confused] ...Wait, what? Sea people?
Stan
The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
Chef
Uhh, maybe you'd better start from the beginning.
Forty-three seconds later...
Stan
...and then we put them back in the tank.
Chef
[drops the bag, suitcase, and tickets] Oohhh, children, you misunderstood. Sea people is different from se-men.
Kyle
It is?
Chef
Yes! That stuff that was in that vial didn't come from you, it came from someone else. [begins to chuckle] I thought you children took turns rapin' and then murdered the teacher. [laughs]
Cartman
Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
Chef
Relax, children, drinkin' some brine shrimp can't kill you. Your teacher must have died from something else.
Kyle
Oh, really?? [all four boys let out a sigh of relief]
Tweek
Egh! I'm so relieved. Gaah-ah-ah!
Chef
Alright. You children have had a long night. Why don't we all get some rest and on Monday, I'll sing you a song explainin' the difference between semen and sea people. [picks up the stuff. The boys approach] Come on, children. I'll walk you all home. [the boys follow Chef out]
Stan
[turns and waves to Cartman] Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. [turns and exits. Kyle follows]
Cartman
G'night, guys.
Kyle
I'm so glad we're not murderers. [Cartman closes the door behind them, moves to his bed and talkes off his hat and shoes. He places his hat on a corner of the footboard and hops into bed]
Cartman
[settling in] Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. [dozes off. The camera moves to the tank to look at the tank.]
South Park, next day. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek stand at the bus station waiting for the bus.
Cartman
[rushes up] H'you guys! Come quick! [turns and runs off] You won't believe it!
Stan
Oh no, what now? [the boys turn left and follow]
Cartman's house, later. He leads them to his room, to the tank.
Cartman
Those sea men from the teacher's stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and, ah, well LOOK! [the other three approach the tank. Cartman picks up the magnifying glass for a closer look]
Kyle
Whoa. [the close-up reveals a budding civilization with sea people building multi-story apartments and reads. The brine shrimp have begun to morph into sea people. Some of them wear clothes]
Stan
How? How did that happen?
Cartman
I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics. [brings out a small chalkboard with an equation written on it and points to the various parts of the equation] Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
Kyle
Whoa.
Stan
They've already accomplished so much.
Tweek
They're like, bacteria. Small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate.
Cartman
That's right, Tweek. And if my theory is correct, all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents, and we can really see them thrive. Tweek!
Tweek
Hr!
Cartman
You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in.
Kyle
Well what are you gonna do?
Cartman
Me? [camera closes in on him] I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
Dougie's room, day. Butters and Dougie are in costume. Between them is a contraption under a white sheet.
Butters
I've done it, General Disarray. I've watched all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold! [pulls the sheet off] This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise. [grins] People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey! [begins to cackle. Dougie fiddles with the machine] You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
Dougie
No, I think the Simpsons would be more clever than that.
Butters
Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
Announcer
[a commercial for Cheesy-Poofs gives way to a Simpsoons commercial] Tonight on the Simpsons: It's a laughorama when Bart builds a machine that takes the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replaces them instead, with mayonnaise.
Butters
Nnno [turns and faces the TV], uh no, no, it can't be.
Dougie
Uh oh, Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it! [a shot of the TV]
Butters
No! No! [begins hallucinating]
Dougie
[now looking like Bart and no longer in costume] Simpsons did it! Simpsons did it!
Butters
Aaaaah!
Dougie
Don't have a cow, man.
Butters
Oh sweet Jesus!
Sperm Bank of South Park, day. Cartman hums as he approaches the door. He enters and walks down the hall. The tellers follow him with their eyes.
Woman
Can I help you?
Cartman
Yes, my mommy told me this is where I could find some sea men?
Woman
Your... mom told you?
Cartman
Do you have them or not?
Woman
We... sell semen, yes, but not normally to children.
Cartman
What's your name?
Woman
Frances Velman.
Cartman
Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? [she looks at him and rises, moving off to her left.]
Frances
[goes to a refrigerator and pulls out a sample] Everything we supply here is by a quarter-ounce. [returns to the desk and gives it to Cartman] One donor, certified, on record.
Cartman
[inspecting the vial] I see, very interesting. [pulls the cap off and pours the semen onto his left hand]
Frances
What are you doing?
Cartman
Takin' a look here. [pulls out a portable microscope and inspects the semen between his left thumb and index finger. He stretches and squishes the semen. Frances looks on puzzled] Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
Frances
Five? Vials?
Cartman
No, gallons.
Frances
Www-we don't have that much here.
Cartman
Dammit! Give me all you've got, then! [the seminal fluid slides down on his fingers]
South Park, in town. Butters runs from Dougie, who chases after him.
Butters
Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!
Dougie
Simpsons did it!! Simpsons did it!! [Butters runs past Tom's Rhinoplasty, but stops to look at the town. It warps into Springfield; Tom's Rhinoplasty becomes Wink-E Mart]
Butters
Waaaah! [starts to run again, and the school bus pulls up. Butters hails it down.] Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! [the door opens and Butters steps on]
Ms. Crabtree
[looking like Otto the driver, but still with bird in hair] SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!
Butters
[jumps backwards] Haaah! [ends up on his back on the sidewalk as the bus pulls away]
Mr. Garrison
[looking like Smithers] Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat?
Chef
[looking like Dr. Hibbert] Hello there, children!
Butters
[runs back the other way] Aaah! Nooo! [Chef and Garrison look at each other]
Mr. Garrison
...What the hell's wrong with him?
Cartman's room, later. Stan looks at the aquarium and sees the civilization has developed further. Pyramids now appear. The sound of running water is in the background. Cut to Kyle filling a larger tank with a water hose..
Stan
Look, the sea people have evolved to an Egyptian-like culture.
Tweek
Soon they'll discover frozen food. Goh-ho.
Cartman
[entering] That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
Tweek
Uh-uh huh.
Stan
Well, drop them in! [Tweek opens the packets and drops the contents in]
Cartman
And I've got the sea men. [raises a bowl of semen up to the tank and begins scooping the fluid into the tank.]
Kyle
Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
Cartman
Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
Stan
That's cool.
Cartman
Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh. [scoops out the last of the semen] There we go. [drops the empty bowl]
Stan
[hands Cartman the smaller tank] Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. [Cartman takes the tank and turns it over, pouring the sea ciety into the larger tank. Screams are heard from the sea people]
Cartman
Nothin' to do now but wait.[the boys huddle around the new, larger tank.]
Stan
...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
Cartman
Uh-huh, suck it out of a hose, yeah.
Stan
Hm.
Kyle
Huh.
Cartman's house, next day. He's asleep, but begins to stir. His eyes open and he grins at what he sees. He hops off the bed and rushes to the tank. He looks here and there and finds a more advanced civilization in the tank.
Cartman
Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years. [grabs his magnifier and looks at the society. It now looks Roman. He begins to speak in wonder] Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-? [spots a statue. It's one of him. Hundreds of sea people worship it] Oh. They think I'm God. [throws the magnifier away and rejoices] Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?! [runs to his window, throws the doors open and screams out] I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!! [his mom opens the door and takes some trash to the trash can next to the driveway] Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
Liane
[returning to the house] That's nice, poopie. [enters and closes the door]
Butters' house, day. He's sitting in the living room, which now takes the appearance of the Simpson living room.
News Anchor
[shown as Kent Brockman] And in other South Park News, elementary school teacher Ms. Choksondik's [Simpsonized] autopsy has shown that the semen in her stomach belongs to school counselor, Mr. Mackey. [also Simpsonized] However, the semen apparently did NOT contribute to the death, and so Mr. Mackey's identity is to remain anonymous. [Mackey's image becomes a silhouette and a question mark appears over it. Simpsonized Stan and Kyle enter the room.]
Stan, Kyle
Hey Butters.
Butters
[spots their altered appearance] Haaa!
Stan
Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
Butters
Cartman?
Cartman
[arrives, shown as Nelson] Ha ha! [Butters is just stunned.]
Cartman's house, whick now looks like a typical Springfield house, day. In Cartman's room, everyone but Butters is shown Simpsons-style. Present are Chef, Mr. Garrison, Liane, Tweek, Timmy, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Dougie, and Butters. Cartman displays his new sea ciety.
Cartman
Behold! You all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness! I am Eric Cartman, god.
Kyle
Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? [Butters looks on with some trepidation]
Cartman
Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
Mr. Garrison
That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
Cartman
I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
Butters
[sensing a chance to retort] Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
Cartman
What the hell is wrong with you, Butters?
Butters
They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it starts to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
Cartman
[everyone is silent for a few seconds, then] ...So?
Kyle
...Yeah. So?
Cartman
Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
Stan
Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
Mr. Garrison
Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.
Chef
Yeah. In fact, that episode was a rip-off of a Twilight Zone episode.
Butters
Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter. [smiles. Everything before him is back in South Park-style] Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
Chef
Good for you!
Cartman
Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
Butters
[heads for the door] I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! [runs out of the room. Dougie stays behind]
Stan
Hey, look everybody! The other side of the aquarium is building another statue! [the others turn around to see. Shown is a statue of Tweek in progress]
Kyle
Hey! It's Tweek.
Tweek
Me?? Aw, man! I don't wanna be a god. That is waaay too much pressure.
Cartman
That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! [small explosions are seen and the tank jumps]
Mr. Garrison
What's going on now?
Kyle
The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
Tweek
Gaaa-hah!
Cartman
Yeah! Go! [two more explosions are seen]
Tweek
NOW what's happening?
Stan
The sea people on Tweek's side just suicide-bombed the Cartman statue.
Cartman
Oh God-damnit! [two missiles, one from behind each statue, fly towards the surface and back down towards their respective targets. The impacts both missiles create tear the tank apart and the sea people flood out of the tank. Screams are heard as they fall to the ground. Cartman is stunned, he looks and falls on his knees.] Oh no! Oh the humanity!
Mr. Garrison
Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
Kyle
Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
Cartman
Why can't societies just live in peace?
End of The Simpsons Already Did It

Red Hot Catholic Love
South Park Catholic Church, day. Organ music plays. Inside, Priest Maxi is at the pulpit speaking to the congregation.
Priest Maxi
Parents, it's that time of year again when the bishops and priests from around the country are organizing the Young Men's Catholic Retreat. This year, we're taking the boys on a weekend boat trip to discuss Jesus's role as the Navigator of our lives.
Stan
That sounds pretty fun.
Randy
[pondering] A Catholic boat trip? [raises his left eyebrow and begins to daydream. He first sees a ship and disco music starts to play. What he imagines is "The Catholic Boat," a television program about cruises on a luxury cruise ship.]
Singer
The Catholic Boat's gonna be headin' on out today.
The Catholic Boat. Time to throw all of your cares away.
Get some hot Christian action; it'll make you-

As the song is sung, the show's logo appears: "The Catholic Boat." A pink anchor rises and ushers in the next scene: A happy Father Michaels stroking his chin. A second anchor, and Young Boy #1 (Butters) is shown. A third anchor and Father Williams appears. He pulls his shirt up to expose his chest. The fourth anchor, and Young Boy #2 (Tweek) is shown. The fifth anchor, and three priests, Fathers Abraham, Duncan, and Ortiz, are shown partying. Father Abraham falls over laughing. Father Duncan grabs Father Ortiz behind the head and pushes the head down... The sixth anchor, and Young Boy #3 (Stan) is shown. A priest's arm appears, running the index finger all over Stan's face...
Randy
[snapping out of it] Waaah! Waaah! [stops. Everyone in church looks at him, including Priest Maxi] Uyah [coughs a few times and clears his throat] ahem. 'Scuse me.
South Park Catholic Church, day. Mass ends and the congregants go to their cars. A crowd gathers around Randy. The McCormicks are present.
Randy
Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
Richard
We can let them go, can we?
Linda
There's no way my son's going.
A black SUV, nearby. Stan, Cartman and Tweek are in the back seat. Cartman looks out the closed window.
Stan
What are they talking about?
Cartman
I don't know.
Tweek
Maybe they wanna kill us.
Back to the crowd.
Randy
With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.
Stuart
[dressed in fur-lined denim] Now, come on, everybody, just because a few priests in the country have been corrupted doesn't mean that all priests are child molesters.
Richard
Well, sure, that's easy for you to say; your son's dead. But those of us with alive children need to be sure that Father Maxi's on the up-and-up.
Sharon
I've heard about other towns bringing in counselors that know how to find things out from kids without really telling them what's going on.
Randy
It couldn't hurt.
Richard
Uh, Sh-sh. Here he comes, here he comes. [all fall silent, then start whistling as Father Maxi passes by.]
Priest Maxi
[stops to listen] Uh... Good-bye, everyone.
All
[not all at once] Good-bye, Father. [resume whistling as Father Maxi walks off]
Stephen
Alright, then, it's settled. Tomorrow we'll find an outside counselor and... find out the truth.
Park County Community Center, next day. The boys are chattering when a woman comes in and stands before them.
Counselor
Hi boys. My name is Ms. Gorache and I need to ask you a few questions about your priest, okaaay?
Boys
Okay.
Counselor
Okay. Would you say that Father Maxi is... nice? Or mean?
Boys
[separately] Nice.
Stan
Um, cool.
Counselor
Okaaay, what words would you use to describe your church's priest? [long pause]
Butters
Compassionate.
Counselor
Okay. And did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt? [long pause]
Cartman
Ih... in our... butt?
Counselor
You don't need to be ashamed or embarrassed. Just, did he ever try to put anything in your butt?
Stan
...Like ...money? What?
Butters
You mean, like a goldfish?
Counselor
No, no. Did he ever try to put anything that belonged to him in your butt?
Boys
[in unison] No.
The Community Center, hallway. The parents wait for the counselor to finish talking with the boys.
Thomas
This is ridiculous, havin' to sit out here waitin' to find out if our priest molested our kids.
Roger
Yeah, what has Catholicism come to anyway?
Randy
[rising. The others on his bench rise with him] You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!
Richard
That's a good idea. I'm gonna be an atheist too.
Linda
Let's all be atheists!
All
Yeah, yeah, alright.
Roger
If there was a god, why would he let our kids be molested in the first place?
Stephen
Yeah, let's kill God, yeah!
Randy
Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.
Stephen
[thinks a bit, then looks at Randy] ...Same thing.
Randy
Yeah! [all clamor and charge out of the center]
South Park proper, on the curb. Stan, Cartman, and Tweek sit and think about stuff...
Stan
What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? [silence. Only birds are heard]
Cartman
[thinking] Maybe... No.
Kyle
[stopping by] Hey dudes.
Stan, Cartman
Hey.
Tweek
Arr!
Kyle
What are you guys doin'?
Stan
We had to go meet with this counselor lady, and she asked us if the priest ever put anything in our butts.
Kyle
In your butts?
Cartman
Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
Kyle
Why would he put anything in your butts?
Stan
We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
Cartman
Hm.
Kyle
[joins them on the curb] Hm. [long pause]
Chef
[stopping by] Hello there, children!
Stan
Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
Chef
Good-bah! [leaves quickly]
Tweek
Rrrh. Nobody is going to tell us. This is going to drive me insane!
Kyle
Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
Cartman
Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
Stan
What?
Cartman
[gets up and starts pacing] It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
Kyle
Yeah.
Cartman
Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth. [long pause] Hm?
Kyle
Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
Cartman
What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
Kyle
It wouldn't work!
Cartman
Have you ever tried it?
Kyle
I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
Cartman
I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
Kyle
You're on, fat boy!
Cartman
Okay, let's go, Jew! [Cartman rushes off and Kyle follow. Stan and Tweek remain seated on the curb.]
Parents
[pass by in a crowd screaming] Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!
Randy
Stan, you're an atheist now!
Richard
You too, Tweek!
Parents
[moving on] Yeah, yeah! Down with God! Down with God!
Tweek
I'm a what??
Diocesan headquarters, day. Sixteen priests are present in the boardroom, with Father Maxi presiding.
Priest Maxi
Fathers, I want to thank you all for coming.
Priest 1
[African-American] No, thank you for finally organizing an all-priests meeting, Father Maxi. I think we all agree something has to be done, quickly. [the other priests concur]
Elderly Priest
Well, I don't know how it's been for all of you, but attendance at my church in Fort Rawlins is down sixty-three percent! [pounds on the table for emphasis]
Priest 2
I'm down almost seventy in Greenleaf.
Priest Maxi
Uh-yes, uh, I'm afraid if things keep going the way they are, we could lose our entire religion.
Elderly Priest
Yes, we've gotta stop these boys from goin' to the public!
Fat Priest
They've gotta know to keep their mouths shut!
Other Priests
That's right, yeah.
Priest Maxi
Right, and so... wa- wait a minute. What?
Priest 1
Yes, but we've got to find out why these children are suddenly finding it necessary to report that they're being molested. Stop the problem at its source.
Priest 2
Yes, but how?
Priest 3
[amid discussion] Something has to be done.
Priest 4
We've got to stop this-
Priest Maxi
[rising] Whoa, whoa, hold on a second! The problem is that children are being molested, not that they're reporting it! [all fall silent]
Elderly Priest
How do you mean?
Priest Maxi
Well, I mean, obviously, what we need to put a stop to is all the sexual misconduct that is allowed to take place in our churches, and not just tell the children not to tell anybody about it. I mean, right?
Priest 1
Well did any of the children you've molested come forward?
Priest Maxi
No.
Priest 1
Well, that's good.
Priest Maxi
No, I mean! I've never molested any of the children in my church!
Elderly Priest
Hih-it's okay, Father Maxi. We're all priests here; the doors are closed.
Priest Maxi
Oh for the love of God! Are you all saying that you've engaged in inappropriate relations with your altar boys? We are here to bring the light of God, not harm the innocent! [the other priests look at him and laugh] I'm serious!
Priest 2
Father, uh, having sex with boys is part of the Catholic priest's way of life.
Other Priests
Yeah. [they continue to talk, but Father Maxi isn't listening...]
Priest Maxi
Dear God. This problem is much more severe than I could have possibly imagined. I have to go to the Vatican and get help.
South Park Elementary School, boys' bathroom, day. A group of fourth-grade boys gather around a toilet as Cartman stands before it trying to crap into it... with his mouth.
Kyle
Well, Cartman?
Cartman
[turns to look at Kyle] Hold on! [turns back to the task at hand] God, let a man crap!
Craig
[entering] What's going on?
Stan
Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
Craig
Oh. [leaves]
Kyle
Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
Cartman
I'm doin' it already!! God, give me a minute!
Stan
You've had five, dude!
Cartman
[looking at the boys] I can't-, I can't do it with you guys watching. Turn around.
Kyle
No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
Cartman
Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?! [the other boys fix their gaze at him] Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. [tries again. A few spasms later and a big log of crap comes out his mouth and into the toilet. All the boys are stunned, even Cartman.]
Kyle
Get the fuck out of here!
Cartman
[excited] Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth! [starts chanting] I crapped out my mo-outh! [walks over to Kyle] You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!
Vatican City, Italy. Father Maxi has made it to St. Peter's Square. He exits a taxi cab.
Priest Maxi
[to the driver] Well, there you go. Um, grazie. [the driver leaves, Father Maxi turns to walk to the Vatican] Wow, I'm actually here. Vatican City! [looks at the fountains on either side of the square. Inside the Vatican a choir sings softly in the background as Father Maxi awaits the pope. The room is full or prelates. The pope, hunched over and frail, approaches the altar with a group of bishops]
Italian Cardinal
Your Holiness, this is Father Maxi from America. He has brought this all to our attention.
Priest Maxi
[kneels before the pope] Your Holiness. [kisses the ring and the pope moans a bit in pain. The cardinal helps the pope up to his chair, then turns and approaches the pulpit.]
Italian Cardinal
Adoramus te, Christe.
Other Cardinals
Et dominus...
Italian Cardinal
Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an American priest by the name of-a Maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news. All over his-a country there are reports of children being molested by men of the Church. If things continue this way, we'll never be able to have sex with young boys again! [the prelates react immediately, protesting the report]
Priest Maxi
That's right-wait. What?
French Cardinal
In France as well we are finding it harder and harder to... make love to our boys.
Moroccan Cardinal
In Morocco they have arrested five of my priests. It's only a matter of time before they get the rest of us.
Italian Cardinal
Father Maxi, what do you suggest we do to not get caught.
Priest Maxi
Not get caught? NO!! I, I think what we should do is not have sex with boys! [the prelates protest again]
Italian Cardinal
It is not written anywhere in the Holy Document of Vatican Law that sex with-a boys is wrong..
Priest Maxi
Well, maybe we need to change the Holy Document of Vatican Law. [the prelates protest even louder]
British Cardinal
Speaking on behalf of the British Catholics, it is obvious that the priest doesn't realize that the Holy Document of Vatican Law can not be changed!
The Clergy
[more protests] Yeah! It cannot be changed! Yeah!
Gelgamek Cardinal
Yes, and speaking on behalf of the Gelgamek Catholics, I believe we should move on to other solutions to this problem. [the prelates protest even louder]
Priest Maxi
Gelgameks?
Kyle's house, night. Cartman walks alone to the front door and rings the doorbell. Kyle comes to answer it. He opens the door...
Cartman
Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. [puts his hands behind his back oh so modestly]
Kyle
What? [appears genuinely concerned]
Cartman
It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars! [Kyle gets upset] I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- [Kyle shuts the door on him, looks, then turns around and walks away from the door. Cartman pops up outside a window waving the bill at him. Kyle turns, goes to the window, and lowers the blinds, then walks off]
Stan's house, dinner time. Sharon brings out hamburgers from the kitchen.
Randy
Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
Sharon
That's right, everyone just dig in. [Grandpa takes a bite from his burger] So, kids, anything fun happen with your whole Sunday off?
Stan
Uh, Cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth.
Sharon
Stanley! [Shelly isn't too pleased to hear that]
Stan
What? He did.
Randy
Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.
Stan
Yeah it does.
Randy
No it doesn't.
Stan
[firmly] Yeah. It does. [Randy looks at him angrily, then wonders if it could be...]
Stan's house, bedtime. Randy is in his pajamas kneeling before the toilet. He's now trying to crap out his mouth. After much effort, a log of crap comes out his mouth and into the toilet. Randy is stunned.
Randy
Honey! Honey, come quick!
St. Peter's Square, day. Father Maxi is trying to get his point across.
Priest Maxi
Look, people! I'm just trying to say that if we don't change the Holy Document of Vatican Law, then we might lose everyone to atheism!
French Cardinal
What exactly do you suggest we change, Father Maxi.
Priest Maxi
Well, for one, no sex with boys. [the prelates protest even louder]
Another Cardinal
The Holy Document of Vatican Law states that a priest, bishop, or cardinal cannot get married, so where are we to get our sex?
Priest Maxi
Uh well then, perhaps we could change the Holy Document of Vatican Law to say that... it's okay for a priest or bishop or cardinal to have sex... with women. [the prelates protest even louder]
French Cardinal
Women?
Gelgamek Cardinal
The Gelgamek vagina is three feet wide and filled with razor-sharp teeth. Do you really expect us to have sex with them?!
Priest Maxi
Wuh- okay, m-maybe we just need to forget about the Gelgameks for a second and focus-
Gelgamek Cardinal
Forget about the Gelgameks?! [the other Gelgamek clergy protest loudly]
Priest Maxi
I'm just saying, what works on planet Gelgamek isn't necessarily goin' ta work for the rest of us here, on Earth. You see? That's the problem we're having here.
Italian Cardinal
But-a the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed!
Priest Maxi
Why not?!
Another Cardinal
Because we don't know where it is.
Italian Cardinal
You see, Father, the Holy Document of Vatican Law has been hidden away deep in the Catacombs of-a St. Peter's below us. Hidden away so that it can never be changed.
Priest Maxi
But if we locate it we can make changes to it?
A Bishop
HA! Good luck, father! The document is guarded by water lizards, rattlesnakes and sand traps! The fools who have tried before to recover it met their deaths!
Priest Maxi
Well we have to try. Our religion is dying!
Stan's house. He, Kyle, and Tweek watch television. The front door closes off screen.
Cartman
[arriving] You guys! You guys! Look! [he's dressed in a bathrobe, swim trunks, and sandals]
Tweek
Harrr!
Cartman
I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
Stan
So?
Cartman
So? So now I can do this! [takes off his robe, throws the bills in the air, and rolls around in the floating bills.] Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
Kyle
[simmers quietly, then] Go fuck yourself, Cartman!
Cartman
[luxuriating in the bills] Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
Kyle
[gets off the couch and confronts Cartman] Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
Cartman
Gee Kyle, don't be a sore loser. It's over, okay? I won. Let it go.
Kyle
So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! [a news bulletin's music is heard]
Stan
Dude, look.
News Anchor
[the News 4 set is shown] Our top story tonight, the age-old question has been answered: if I put food up my ass, will I crap out my mouth? All over the country, people are discovering that, yes, in fact, you will. [a new picture pops up] The surgeon general had this to say:
Surgeon General
And the uh immediate research shows that the act is not only amusing, but in fact much healthier for our bodies than the old way of eating. [stands next to a cut-away graphic of the human torso] You see, food entering through the anus has the benefit of being broken down on its way to the stomach rather than afterward. And therefore I believe that interorectogestion would actually put a stop to high cholesterol and most kinds of stomach cancers. And I base that on absolutely nothing.
News Anchor
The Surgeon-General's response has made Americans change their eating habits almost instantly.
Cartman
[with a solid retort] That's stupid and immature, Cartman!
Kyle
[moves closer to Cartman] It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a freakin' medal?!
News Anchor
The Mayor of South Park has announced that for first discovering this healthy way of eating, young citizen [Cartman's picture appears] Eric Cartman will be given... a freaking medal.
Kyle
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
A kitchen set in a studio, day. An attractive woman is busy preparing a dish on the stove.
Announcer
[a show logo appears...] Now, with more on "Martha Stewart's Living" [the logo disappears and the camera zooms in].
Martha Stewart
In the past few days we've all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion, and so making food that can easily be inserted into the ass is essential. [begins to move to her left] Now, everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass - puddings, soups, raisins... this is a nice raisin pudding right here - but we can also still eat our favorite foods. What we're gonna do today is prepare a Thanksgiving turkey for interorecto. [reaches the turkey and stops] Now, the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string, keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side. [starts wrapping the turkey. Two FBI agents show up at the rear of the set]
FBI Agent
Ms. Stewart, we have some questions.
Martha Stewart
[starts wrapping faster] Not right now, I just wanna focus on my turkey, [softly] right now. [the agents withdraw. She finishes and lays the turkey down on a platter] Now, we're going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice - this'll help smooth the insertion later on. We still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound. [leaves that turkey alone and moves further left to a turkey fresh from the oven] When it's done we'll get something like this. [grins] So now we're ready to go. Looks delicious. Let's try it out. [takes the cooked turkey, moves to a clear area onstage, sets the platter down, stands the turkey up, moves into position, and sits on the turkey. Slowly, with grunts every few seconds, she eats the turkey with her butt] Aaaaa-... Yeah, get it up there. Yeah. AAAA. Yeeaahhhh. [one final heavy grunt, and a sigh of relief, then she stands up] Phew. And that is how you eat a turkey. [grins] We'll be right back with more. [grins, and exit music plays]
The Catacombs under St. Peter's Basilica. Father Maxi, with torch in hand, walks down a hall past walls with writing on them. He descends some stairs and crosses a large room, stopping at a door behind which there is a brightly-lit room.
Old Monk
[appears out of nowhere] Beoo!
Priest Maxi
[jumps back] Ahh, hello. Uh- My name is Father Maxi, from the United States.
Old Monk
What do you seek, Father?
Priest Maxi
I... I'm trying to find the Holy Document of Vatican Law. ...So that we can make revisions to it.
Old Monk
That Gospel... [turns around and faces the door] lies somewhere beyond this door. [turns around] But... many trials await thee inside! Only he whose heart truly belongs to the Lord shalla make it through.
Priest Maxi
I have to try. Our religion is in trouble, and... and that scroll may be our only hope!
Old Monk
Then, prepare yourself. The time of trials begins. [turns and says to the door] Adoramus te, Christe! [the door becomes two doors, and they part to show the brilliant room. The old monk approaches Father Maxi] I wish you luck, Father. [moves to Father's left side and coaches him] Use all the strength, agility, and faith that you have.
Priest Maxi
Very well. Here we go. [enters and finds himself in a video game environment. He jumps over a hole in one screen, jumps on the heads of three alligators gingerly in the next screen, grabs at a rope and swings over a lake to the other side in the third screen. He reaches the fourth screen. A snake appears in the underground passageway beneath him] Hmmm, there's a ladder up here. [climbs down the ladder and sees the snake] Oh my God, a rattlesnake! [turns and runs past the ladder to the next screen, where another ladder awaits] A way back up! [climbs up and rushes out of there. He enters a secret chapel, having survived all the obstacles to get there. He's quite beaten up. The document sits on a lectern and is well-lit. Father Maxi sighs] I've made it! Praise be to God! He hath shown me the way! [approaches the document] This must be it. The Holy Document of Vatican Law. [picks it up and blows any dust from it.]
The Marsh house, day. Six sets of parents sit around the living room coffee table. Randy sits on the sofa with the Stotches. Above them hangs a banner with red letters on white fabric: "SOUTHPARK ATHEISTS' CLUB".
Randy
Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. [all laugh]
Linda
Well it's true. I mean, what do a bunch of stories about people in robes slaughtering goats have to do with today's world?
Richard
Atheism has definitely made our lives better.
Sharon
[arrives with fresh food and a basket] I made some quesadillas, if anybody wants some.
All
Ooohh.
Sharon
And if anybody needs to potty, there's a potty basket right here. [sets it down next to the coffee table]
Richard
Oh thanks, Sharon.
Roger
You know, for Martha and I, we're, we're worried we might have a hard time raising our son atheist. I mean- [the quesadillas appear, and he takes one] whoa, thank you -I mean, [rises and unzips his pants] it could end up being very difficult raising an atheist child in such a Christian society. [puts the quesadilla up to his butt and begins eating it. This causes him to grunt at times. Martha looks away] I feel that everywhere my poor son goes he's being persecuted for his beliefs. [finishes eating and zips up]
Richard
That's true. If I'm gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don't want him saying "under God" every day at school. That could really damage him. "Under God" should be taken out of the- uh, 'scuse me. [turns aside, looks down, and opens his mouth] Moowwaaagh. [faces the group again and brushes off any remaining crap with his sweater sleeve] "Under God" should be taken out of the Pledge of Allegiance.
Randy
[amid the chatter] That's right, I agree. [the others quiet down] And it should be taken off of money as well. [gets angry] The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel- [reaches for the basket and craps into it] Bwwaaaagh [finishes and sets the basket down] And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.
All
That's right, that's right.
St. Peter's Basilica, day.
Italian Cardinal
Cardinals, bishops and priests! Father Maxi has returned! And he has the Holy Document of-a Vatican Law! [the clergy ooohs and aaahs]
British Cardinal
How did he make it past the water lizards?
Priest Maxi
[lifts the parchment over his head for all to see] Yes, I have returned with the Holy Document of Vatican Law, so can we PLEASE, change it now to say, "It's NOT okay to have sex with boys"? [a shot of the clergy as the tapping of a staff is heard. It's the pope striking the ground with it.]
Italian Cardinal
Wait wait-a, the pope-a wants-a to say something. [the cardinal approaches the pope and has words with him, then returns to the pulpit] The pope-a says we shall ask the highest source. [the clergy ooohs and aaahs. They begin to sway and chant, and the windows above brighten as beams of light flood in]
Priest Maxi
[taken aback] Oh my. [a large screen-size area appears and a large creature rises from the depths]
Italian Cardinal
The holy one! [arachnid legs appear] Behold the great Queen Spider! [sure enough, a spider some twenty feet tall appears]
The Clergy
Hail Queen Spider!
Priest Maxi
[looking at the Italian cardinal] Queen Spider?
Italian Cardinal
O great Queen Spider, we seek a-your guidance.
Queen Spider
What do you ask of me?
British Cardinal
Great Queen Spider, we wish to change one of the Vatican rules.
Queen Spider
The Vatican rules cannot be changed. So saith the Spider.
Italian Cardinal
Go on, Priest Maxi. See if you can convince her.
Priest Maxi
Alright, that does it!!! I've had enough!!! You people have completely lost touch with the outside world! You sit in this big room with your Gelgameks and your Queen Spider, and none of it applies to what being a Catholic is all about!!
A Bishop
But the Holy Document of Vatican Law states that-
Priest Maxi
To hell with the Holy Document of Vatican Law!! [tears it in two, and the clergy gasps. The basilica begins to tremble and fall apart and the clergy start screaming in fear. Outside, the square itself begins to crumble]
South Park, day. The boys stand in front of Stan's house.
Cartman
[rushes up] You guys, you guys! [drags a small inflatable wading pool behind him] I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
Kyle
[irritated] So?
Cartman
So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long! [picks up the bag of quarters and prepares to pour them in] Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. [the quarters start pouring in, and Cartman gloats]
Kyle
[approaches Cartman and tries a different tack] Cartman, there's something I need to tell you.
Cartman
O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
Kyle
You were totally, one hundred percent right.
Cartman
Heh... [the smile vanishes] what?
Kyle
You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
Cartman
[taking time to figure out what that means...] You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! [kicks the pool and it deflates. He walks away angry. Stan and Kyle grin at each other - they planned this change in tactics. The parents arrive cheering and hollering]
A Man
Yeah, the pope is gone!
Randy
Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!
Linda
Score one for us atheists!
Richard
Come on, Tweek! We're gonna watch it on TV! [the parents resume clamoring and move off]
Vatican City, day. The clergy mill around in the ruins of the Vatican.
Italian Cardinal
Gone! It's all gone!
British Cardinal
Well, thanks a lot, Father Maxi. You've killed our religion.
Priest Maxi
No I didn't! All that's dead are your stupid laws and rules! [the scene is being telecast] You've forgotten what being a Catholic is all about. [raises a Bible] This... book. You see, these are just stories. [the Marshes are gathered on the sofa to watch this. Grandpa is asleep in his wheelchair] Stories that are meant to help guide people in the right direction. Love your neighbor. Be a good person. [the Williams are watching] That's it! And when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power, well... Well, you end up with this. [shows off the ruins, and then the Queen Spider, then the Gelgameks] People are losing faith because they don't see how what you've turned the religion into applies to them! They've lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion, and when they have no mythology to try and live their lives by, well, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths! [The Tweeks are watching. Richard seems to have crapped out of his mouth]
Richard
[pause, then looks up] ...What was that last bit?
Priest Maxi
Look, I, I'm proud to be a Catholic. But I'm a Catholic in the real world. In today's world! It's time for you all to do that, too. It is time... for change.
Stan's house, after the telecast.
Randy
[after a moment of reflection] He's right, Sharon. We don't have to believe every word of the Bible. They're just stories to help us to live by. We shouldn't toss away the lessons of the Bible just because some assholes in Italy screwed it up.
Sharon
O Randy, I don't wanna put food up my butt anymore.
Randy
Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.
Stan
Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
Randy
No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. [all of a sudden, one more piece of crap comes out his mouth]
End of Red Hot Catholic Love

Free Hat
The Bijou, day, inside. The four boys are seated in the front row in the nearly empty theater. A couple sits near the back, just three rows behind.
Stan
Oh, cool. A preview. [the curtain goes up and the preview, for a PG-rated film, airs]
Announcer
Coming this summer [those words seem to approach the viewer], it's the classic film that changed America. E.T.: The Extraterrestrial, the new, redone version for 2002. [First, the classic shot of the kids flying across the sky with the moon in the background, then a shot of the kids taking off from the road. The police who are there to stop the kids have walkie-talkies in hand instead of guns.] All the E.T. effects have been digitally upgraded. [a shot of E.T. dressed in drag walking across a room] All the guns have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies. And the word "TERRORIST" has been changed to "HIPPIE."
Stan
Aw, dude, why would they do that?
Cartman
Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
Kyle
No, dude. Spielberg changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make E.T. more P.C.
Stan
That's gay. [next trailer airs. No rating seen]
Announcer
Coming this summer, it's the motion picture that changed America. Saving Private Ryan, the RE-RE-RELEASE, where the word "NAZI" has been changed to "PERSONS WITH POLITICAL DIFFERENCES," and all their guns have been replaced by walkie-talkies. [a shot of the landing at Normandy, in all its bloody glory, but all the guns are indeed walkie-talkies]
Stan
Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
Announcer
And now, for your feature presentation: the classic RE-RE-RE-RELEASE of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.
The Boys
Woohoo!
Announcer
In this version, the word "WOOKIE" has been changed to "HAIR CHALLENGED ANIMAL" and the entire cast has been digitally replaced by Ewoks.
The Boys
[first express shock, then anger] AWWWW!!! [they leave their seats.]
The Bijou, day, outside. The boys exit the theater.
Stan
Goddamnit, that pisses me off!
Cartman
[they reach the ticket booth] Yeah, we want our money back!
Ticket Operator
Sorry, suckers! [quickly rolls the blinds down. The boys turn around]
Cartman
You asshole! [turns around and catches up with the other boys]
Kyle
Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
Tweek
Don't you see what this means? All our favorite movies are going to be changed, and updated, until we can't even recognize them anymore.
Stan
Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
Kyle
Yeah, what if they had modified the Roman Coliseum every year? It would just be another big douchey stadium now.
Stan
We have to do something. Let's form a club.
Cartman
Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
Stan
No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
Kyle
Yeah. We'll be the "Save Films From Their Own Directors" club.
Cartman, Stan
Yeah.
Tweek
NO! Nono, ah I don't wanna form a club! That's too much pressure! Look, ah-I'm supposed to take it easy; just, watch the clouds, sit on the grass. And, if we form a club there'll be responsibilites. Commitments!
Cartman
Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
Tweek
I'm not! I'm not a team player!
Cartman
Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
Tweek
[giving in] D'oh-ho! Oh Jesus!
South Park, later. The boys stand next to a phone pole and Stan nails a sign onto it. He finishes and backs up to have a good look at it.
Cartman
Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
Stan
Well what's wrong with it?
Cartman
Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. [takes the marker and adds the words "FRee HAT" at the very end.]
Kyle
"Free hat?"
Cartman
Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
Tweek
But we don't have hats!
Cartman
Well we can just make them out of paper.
Tweek
Aahh!
Cartman
It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
Tweek
You see?? First we were just forming a club, now we have to make hats! When does it end??
Stan
Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. [walks off with Cartman and Kyle screen right]
Tweek
Fifty hats? Oh Jesus! [runs off screen left]
Tweek's house, later. He's at his desk in his room frantically making paper hats. His mug of coffee sits off to his left.
Tweek
Ah! I'll never make it! I'll never make it! [his father happens by and notices the commotion]
Richard
[approaching with his own mug] Tweek!
Tweek
[shrieks] Hrrr!
Richard
Calm down, son. Remember what Dr. Norris told you. Find your center.
Tweek
My center. My... center. [closes his eyes and cups his chest] Calm. [enters a state of meditation. Richard turns and leaves, his cup stays] Puppies. [he finds himself sitting in the Lotus position by the side of a serene stream in a lovely meadow. All kinds of animals frolic around him, and a small Buddhist temple sits in the background]
Cartman
[enormous face appearing over the clouds] Tweek! [brushes the clouds away with his hands] TWEEK!! [Tweek opens his eyes] TWEEK!!
Tweek
[comes out of his meditation] Gaaaaah!
Cartman
How many hats have you made?
Tweek
Oh God!
Cartman
We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow! [slaps him hard across the back.] Get the lead out!
Tweek
Aaaah! Oh God! [Cartman turns and walks out, a rattled Tweek resumes making the hats.]
South Park Elementary gymnasium, next day. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stand outside the doors waiting for Tweek, who rushes up to them with a box of hats. A poster behind them seems to have fallen off the wall.
Tweek
You guys, we have a big problem!
Stan
What?
Tweek
I was up, all night, making hats. I only slept for an hour, ...and then I dreamt about making hats, but I only made fifteen!
Kyle
Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.
Stan
Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet. [turns and opens the door, then peeks in. The place is packed. All the bleachers are filled, and there are five rows of people standing on the gym floor. He backs out, closes the door, and turns to his friends] Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
Tweek
A thousand? [freaks out] Oh Jesus man! I don't have nearly a thousand hats!
Cartman
They're gonna kick your ass, Tweek!
Tweek
Goohoo!
Kyle
[steps forward] Tweek! It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
Crowd
[from inside the gym] Free hat! [Kyle turns right, then left, not believing what he's hearing. Tweek's jaw drops] Free hat! Free hat!
Tweek
["Free hat!"] Oh God!
Cartman
["Free hat! Free hat! Free hat! Free hat!"] I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.
Crowd
Free hat! Free hat!
Tweek
I gotta move away, you guys!
Stan
Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
The school gym, inside. The crowd jumps up and cheers as the four boys enter and climb onstage. Some of the signs they hold read "FREE HAT," "FREEDOM FOR HAT NOW!," and "HAT DIDN'T DO IT".
Stan
[takes the mic] Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
Crowd
Yeah! Yeah!
Stan
Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. [the cheering dies down and a voice pipes up]
Skeeter
Eh- Excuse me?
Cartman
[takes the mic] Yes, we apologize, but our friend Tweek here didn't make enough of them.
Tweek
Oh! Jesus! Don't tell them it was me!
Woman
[a blonde] We don't care about that.
Tweek
You don't?
Stan
You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
Skeeter
Yeah. Free Hat.
Tweek
What?
Man
Hat McCullough. He was sent to prison in '82, and we believe he should be released!
Man 2
Yeah!
Crowd
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Stan
Aaaah, ["Free Ha-"], okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? [the crowd stops moving]
Man
To do what?
Kyle
We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers...
Skeeter
Oh. Sorry. Um, come on, everyone, guess we're in the wrong place. [the crowd breaks up and exits]
Crowd
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Stan
Waitwaitwaitwait! [the crowd stops] Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
Skeeter
Can't we also work towards freeing Hat?
Stan
Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
Some people
Oh yeeaahhh!! Raaaaah!! Woohoo!!
Crowd
Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Stan's house, later. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit at the dining room table, with Stan counting the sign-ups.
Stan
...212, 213, 214 members!
Tweek
[barges in through the front door] You guys! You guys! Oh God! Um, I've got terrible news!
Kyle
What?
Tweek
Ted Koppel wants us to appear on Nightline to talk about our cause.
Stan
Really? That's great.
Kyle
Yah.
Tweek
No it isn't, man! Thahat's waaay too much pressure!
Stan
If we go on Nightline, the whole country can hear about what's happening to our classic films.
Cartman
But just remember that I do all the talking.
Kyle
You?? Why?
Cartman
Because I'm the official spokesman. I got dibs on it.
Stan
When did we do dibs for it?
Cartman
Just now - [quickly, counting off with his left hand] 1 2 3 dibs! [punches his right palm with his left fist]
Kyle
Me.
Tweek
Ga-ahah!
Kyle
Alright, fine! [points to Cartman] You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
Cartman
What could possibly go wrong?
Nightline. Ted Koppel is at his desk with the four boys in the inset over his left shoulder.
Ted Koppel
A new movement is sweeping the country, led by four determined boys from South Park, Colorado. The organization was created to protect Hollywood's classic films from the hands of their directors. And also to free Hat McCullough. So boys, I ask you the question that's on everyone's minds, why does your organization want to free Hat McCullough, the convicted, confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies?
Cartman
[blinks and looks at the camera for a long time] ...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. [the camera moves from Cartman to Tweek]
Tweek
Gaaarh!
Ted Koppel
Well, Hat McCullough admitted he killed those toddlers? Why do you want him free?
Tweek
["TWEEK, ADVOCATE OF TODDLER MURDER" appears at the bottom of the screen] Oh, Jesus, man! ...N'ahah!
Ted Koppel
Just answer me this, Tweek: What do you see as "positive" about toddler murder?
Tweek
Ahah. U-uh. It's easy?
Ted Koppel
[ponders the possibility] Yes... It is easy. [switches gears] Alright, then on to your other cause, saving films from their directors. What got you boys interested in this, especially given your pro-toddler-murder status?
Kyle
We believe that films have to be taken away from people like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas because they're insane.
Ted Koppel
Well I'm glad you said that, boys, because joining us now are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [they walk in and stand behind the boys. The boys look at them a bit awed]
Tweek
Oh Christ! Wwwaaaaaaah!
Steven Spielberg
[wearing a CSLB jacket and director's hat] Hello, Ted.
George Lucas
[meekly] Oh hi, Ted.
Ted Koppel
Gentlemen, these toddler-murder fans think you're insane and shouldn't be allowed to alter your films. Your response?
Steven Spielberg
Well, first of all, both George and I are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers.
George Lucas
Hear hear.
Cartman
[to Stan] Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. [resumes gawking at the two]
Tweek
Get me out of here! Please, somebody get me out of heeerre!
Steven Spielberg
And as for altering our films, all we're doing is trying to reach a... new audience with our movies. As the makers of dreams, we like to speak ...for the children.
Kyle
Ah, we thought we were speaking for the children.
Cartman
Yeah, we're children.
Stan
Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
Cartman
Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
Ted Koppel
How so?
Cartman
Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
George Lucas
I'm not a Jew! [crosses his arms in anger]
Steven Spielberg
You little brat-! Ah, I mean, you darling children don't know what you're talking about. Changing E.T. was the best thing I ever did.
Kyle
Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
Steven Spielberg
[a stroke of brilliance overcomes the two men for a few seconds] Wait a minute. What'd you say?
George Lucas
Eh, that's brilliant!
Steven Spielberg
Yes. Change Raiders of the Lost Ark! Why didn't we think of it before?!
Kyle
[regretting the comparison] No. NOO!!
South Park Elementary School Gym, next day. "SAVE FILMS FROM THEIR DIRECTORS AND FREE HAT MEETING TODAY." The boys stand before the new club once again.
Stan
Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark. [the crowd begins to murmur] There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? [hands the mic to Cartman, who moves over to an easel]
Cartman
Thank you. [turns a page up and over. A schematic of George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch is shown] Our intelligence tells us that the original negative to Raiders of the Lost Ark is currently somewhere in George Lucas's house. We need to find and usurp that negative.
Man 3
And if we get a hold of the negative they can't change the movie?
Stan
That is our understanding.
Woman
Sounds like a good idea to me. I don't want them to change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Crowd
YEAH!
Skeeter
Yeah! We should go get that negative as soon as we get Hat free!
Crowd
YEAH! [the signs go up] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Kyle
[rushes to the mic] Nonono! We need to do this first.
Woman
But we have to free Hat.
Stan
It's just that, you know, he killed twenty-three babies.
Man 4
Well yeah, but it was in self-defense!
Crowd
YEAH!
Cartman
He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
Skeeter
Hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in West Town Park. When that many babies get together they can be like piranha.
Man 5
Three eyewitnesses testified that if Hat hadn't killed those babies, they'd have killed him!
Crowd
YEAH! [the signs go up] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Stan
Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raiders.
Skeeter
He's right. We'd better split up. Some of you go with the boys and get those film prints, the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing Hat.
Crowd
YEAH! [the signs go up and the crowd moves out. Not one of them stays with the boys] Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat! Free Hat!
Stan
Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
Tweek
No! That's it! I'm out! I can't deal with the stress you guys create! [walks off the stage]
Kyle
We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
Tweek
Hwaaah!
Cartman
[rushes up to stop Tweek] Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.
Tweek
Haaah!
Cartman
People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
Skywalker Ranch, night. Inside the camera gets a view of Lucas's library. Among the items there are various props from his Star Wars films, four Emmys, four Oscars... the door opens and a flashlight scans the room. Stan, holding the flashlight, walks in with the other boys.
Stan
Okay, go. [the other boys, with their own flashlights, pour in]
Tweek
[trying to stay composed, with eyes closed] I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm not breaking into George Lucas's house. I'm in a green field.
Cartman
[draws near] Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! [walks off]
Kyle
[eyeing a prop] This looks like the right room.
Tweek
I'm in a field... surrounded by deer.
Stan
[finding the video library] Over here! [the other boys join him at the stacks. They see "Star Wars Episode 1, Version 300," "Star Wars Episode 1, Version 301," "Star Wars Episode 1, Version 302," etc., then "First Day of School" and "First Day of School, Digitally Enhanced," then "Wedding Video" and "Wedding Video, Digitally Enhanced." The camera scans past "Kids First Swimming Lesson" and "Kids First Swimming Lesson w/ Digitally Enhanced Weather" to stop at the reel of "Raiders of the Lost Ark, Original Negative 1982."]
Kyle
That's it!
Cartman
Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
Tweek
Huh uh.
Cartman
Get it, you piece of crap, before I grab your nutsack and twist it!
Tweek
Guh huh huh! [walks off and returns with a stool. He climbs up on it and gets the reel canister. The door opens behind the boys and the lights go on]
George Lucas
What are you doing?! [the boys turn in horror]
Tweek
Oh God! Oh Jesus!
George Lucas
You're the boys from that ...stupid club. Give me that! [grabs the film reel from Tweek]
Tweek
[hops off the stool] Aaaaaah!
Kyle
Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas! [goes down on his right knee] But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
George Lucas
We're gonna make it better. The movie's gonna be changed, and that's that!
Cartman
Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
Stan
Aw, really?
Tweek
Oh God, no! Not Plan B! [Lucas looks at the boys quzzically]
Cartman
[beat] You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? [the boys reach for the left side of their bodies and rip off their clothes. Underneath they wear colorful Latin outfits and grin.]
George Lucas
[confused] ...What??
Cartman
Hit it, Tweek! [Tweek goes over to a boombox and presses the play button, then returns to the group. Caribbean music plays] In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, there's a lots of-
Stan
Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
Cartman
...No, he has an icy heart.
Kyle
...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, r-tard.
Stan
So we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song.
Cartman
It's a cool island song.
Kyle
Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
Cartman
Oh, do we wanna do that?
George Lucas
ALRIGHT, that does it!
Skywalker Ranch, day, Lucas's living room. The boys stand behind Lucas as he talks on the phone with someone.
George Lucas
[listening] Yes, thank you, officer. [hangs up and walks around the boys] The police are on their way, boys. [stops and faces them] Soon you'll be in jail getting RAMMED!
Tweek
[freaks out] Aaaahh!
Stan
Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. [Lucas looks at them]
Kyle
It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. [Lucas hangs his head in shame and turns away]
George Lucas
It is... too late for me, boys.
Kyle
You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
George Lucas
M-that's different. These are my movies. I made them, and I have the right to do whatever I want with them.
Stan
[steps forward] You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
Kyle
When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society.
George Lucas
Have I... become so old that I've forgetten what being an artist is about?
Stan
Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
George Lucas
[turns and approaches them] Perhaps... you are right. [presents the reel to Stan, but a door opens...]
A Voice
STOP! [Lucas is startled and the camera pans to Steven Spielberg and three guards] What are you doing, George?!
George Lucas
Steven, Uh, I-
Steven Spielberg
Give me that print, George! We need to make the alterations!
George Lucas
Steven, these boys had a point. I don't remember what it was, but it was good.
Steven Spielberg
You haven't let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment, have you, George?! [voice lowers] Don't forget: you belong to me.
Kyle
Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! [Lucas, stuck between the two arguments, stops and thinks...]
George Lucas
I'm... ah I'm sorry, boys. [slowly walks to Spielberg and presents the reel. Spielberg snatches it away]
Steven Spielberg
[cackles] Now take the children prisoner! [the guards approach and surround the boys]
Kyle
What??
Steven Spielberg
You troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the NEW Raiders of the Lost Ark! Your gay little club is over!
Stan
Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! [the boys turn and make their way to the door]
Tweek
[runs] Oh my God they're gonna kill us. [the guards block the way, and the other three boys are stuck. Kyle tries to get around a guard, but...]
Guard 1
[aims his walkie-talkie at him] Don't even think about it, kid! I'm not afraid to use this walkie-talkie!
Guard 2
The one with the cocaine-problem escaped, mein Direktor.
Steven Spielberg
Leave him!! Let him run back to his mommy! [strokes the reel canister] We must get the film ready for the premiere. [turns and walks off] Lucas! Come! [Lucas, shame-faced, turns and follows Spielberg out. The boys look at the guards]
A commercial.
Announcer
["COMING THIS SUMMER"] Coming, this summer! ["RE-RELEASE OF EPISODE 1 SOUTHPARK"] It's the digitally-re-enhanced re-release of the very first pilot episode of South Park! [scenes from "Cartman Gets An Anal Probe" play - the cafeteria, the boys walking down the street, Stan, Kyle, and Wendy in the woods, Stan and Kyle at Stark's Pond...] Yes, the classic, rough, hand-made first episode is getting a make-over for 2002! [the visitors are shown, then new 3D versions are shown] The simple, funny aliens are now super-badass and kewl! [the mothership is shown beaming Cartman up, then a much more intricate version is shown] The flying saucer? No longer cheap construction paper, but a 4.0 megapixel nondrop digital masterpiece of technology! Yes! Everything's new! New is better!
Trey Parker
[bearded] When we first made South Park, we didn't wanna use construction paper. We just had to because it was cheap.
Matt Stone
And now with new technology we can finally remaster South Park, make it look sharp, clean and focused.
Trey Parker
Expensive. [Both men nod their heads]
Announcer
[The flames coming from Cartman's ass are replaced with a 3D version, and cars and people are added to the scene] Yes, all the charm of the simple little cartoon [a model of the new ship is rotated to a new position] will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation!
Trey Parker
[a shot of him, then of the bus stop with the boys waiting for the bus. New creatures enter the scene] For instance, in the scene at the bus stop, we always meant to have Imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background, but simply couldn't afford it.
Announcer
[A special-edition DVD of CGAAP "new version for 2002" is shown. "ACT NOW" blinks on the screen over the DVD] Get this special enhanced version quick, because another enhanced version will likely be coming out for 2003!
School Gym, sometime later. "URGENT" in white has been scrawled over the sign next to the door. Tweek stands onstage inside, facing the gathered club.
Tweek
Members, uuhh, oh Jesus, uh, we have to do something! Our club president [Stan], treasurer [Kyle], and secretary [Cartman] have all been taken hostage be Steven Spielberg! Haaa!
Man 3
Prisoner? You mean, like Hat?
Tweek
[grits his teeth, shuts his eyes and bows his head in frustration] Yes, just like Hat!!
Skeeter
But the governor won't pardon Hat. So how can we get him out of prison? [the other members grumble]
Tweek
No! Listen to me! We're not talking about Hat right now, okay?! Gad!! Look, we went to George Lucas's house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song, but then Spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner! They're goin' to premiere their new Raiders of the Lost Ark, and we have to rescue them! Do you understand?!
Woman
Hey, he's got a point there.
Man 6
[a rancher] Yeah... Maybe we could melt the governor's icy heart with a cool island song!
Members
[scattered reaction] Yeah.
Tweek
No!
Skeeter
No?
Man 7
No! He's right. We have to freeze his hot heart with a cool island song.
Woman
Or is it freshen his hot temper with a cool island song?
Man 8
Let's cool his hot temper with a fresh island song.
Man 9
That's it!
Man 10
Let's go! Come on! [the members rally and take off]
Tweek
Oh God. I'm gonna have to do this myself. Oh God!
Excess Hollywood. Raiders of the Lost Ark is featured.
Pat O'Brien
Well, the print is finished and the day has come. Tonight, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas [shown] will be at the premiere of the new special edition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Lots of celebrity guests and other rich people will be on hand to witness all the updated effects and modernized technology.
A desert. Spielberg leads a group of people to the site of the premiere. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are among the guests, but their hands are tied behind their backs. Four people follow carrying a large box from two long poles. The box reads "FINAL PRINT RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK 2002" The three guards are there with Spielberg and Lucas, and Francis Ford Coppola has joined the lead pack. The camera follows the group, but slowly pulls back until Tweek appears with a bazooka on his shoulder.
Tweek
Hello!
Steven Spielberg
[moves forward and takes a hard look at the figure on the hill] The kid? The tweaked out kid?!
Tweek
I'm gonna blow up the print, Spielberg! [the other boys try to sneak away, but the guards are around them quickly]
Steven Spielberg
Your pesistence surprises even me. [begins to fan himself with his hat]
Francis Ford Coppola
[steps forward] Surely you don't think you can escape from this premiere.
Tweek
[fixes his aim on his target] That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want are my friends.
Cartman
Wow.
Tweek
Except for Cartman - you can keep him.
Cartman
AY!
Francis Ford Coppola
And if we refuse?
Tweek
Then your premiere has no movie!
Stan
He's definitely lost it.
Kyle
Yup.
Steven Spielberg
[moves around to clear the area] Okay, okay. Stan- stand back, stand ba- stand back! Back! [people move away] Okay kid, you win. [puts on his hat] Blow it up. [some guards try to get the box, but Spielberg takes a walkie-talkie and forces them back] Zuroch! Zuroch! [turns and faces Tweek] Blow it back to God. [Tweek trembles, but his aim doesn't waver] All your life has been the pursuit of seeing a great film! This new version of Raiders has digital effects beyond your wildest dreams! You want to see it screened just as much as I. [Tweek grunts, showing he may be breaking]
Kyle
Come on, Tweek! Blow it up!
Steven Spielberg
[turns, walks to the box, and stands next to it] Son, we are simply passing through history. This... is imPROVED history. [Tweek stalls. The boys wait for Tweek's next move] Do as you will. [backs away, leaving the box clear. Tweek struggles, but lowers the launcher. Three guards appear behind him]
The governor's office, day. The governor is at his desk, bored. The Free Hat club members break out in song.
Members
In the tropical isles with the coconut trees, the air is fresh and the people are free.
Man 5
But here in the mountains there's no freedom like that.
Skeeter
There's a man in prison and his name is Hat. [the governor looks up a bit surprised]
A sign saying "RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK Premiere Tonight" has alternating blinking lights. The camera moves off the sign and onto the makeshift open-air theater. Two men bring forth the Ark of the Covenant, which was in the box. The men move off. The audience is seen, with the four boys in the very back. Stan and Kyle are tied to one post, Tweek and Cartman to the other. Spielberg, dressed as a High Priest, approaches the Ark.
Steven Spielberg
[moving his arms over the Ark] Hafaa malifi! Thanks for coming, everyone. [the two men return, remove the lid, and walk off with it. A third man reaches inside the Ark and pulls out the "RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK NEW AND IMPROVED 2002" reel] This is the birth of the NEW version of Raiders of the Lost Ark! We shall screen it here, and then destroy all the old prints in celebration!
Audience
Hooray! All right!
Steven Spielberg
Begin the film! [a man loads the film and plays it. On screen, three men appear and approach a mountain]
Audience
[impressed] Whoa.
Stan
[pleading] You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
Tweek
Ah, what?!
Stan
[pleading] Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! [the boys quickly turn away, shut their eyes, and bow their heads]
Audience
[impressed] Whoa. Ahhh.
Steven Spielberg
It's beyooootiful. [a scene of Indiana Jones using a whip to swing across a chasm. Flaming arrows shoot past him. As he lands on the other side, natives approach. They look and chatter like Ewoks]
Viewer 1
Wait a minute. This version is awful!
Viewer 2
Yeah! They ruined it!
Viewer 3
Oh my God, it's terrible! [George Lucas is suddenly frightened stiff. Coppola is also frightened. The boys keep their eyes closed and away from the screen]
George Lucas
AaaaAAAAA!!
The three men huddle, frightened as they are. On screen, Indy is reaching for a golden item. Rays of light alight from the screen and move out over the audience, shooting through the viewers' chests and killing them. Coppola, Lucas, and Spielberg are overwhelmed with the energy from the rays. The men become disfigured, then their faces melt away. Spielberg's head explodes. The rays diffuse, then gather back into the Ark. The spirits of all killed are gathered into the Ark as well. The lid lands on the Ark perfectly with a final roll of thunder. A few second laters, when all is quiet, Stan raises his head and looks around.
Stan
Yuh, you guys okay. [the others open their eyes. The ropes that bound them are gone]
Kyle
Yeah. I I think so.
Cartman
Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
South Park, day. A celebration is taking place at South Park Square. An orchestra performs below the stage. The boys are onstage watching it all. A man, a mayor's aide, walks up to the mic.
Aide
Today is a day of celebration, and we owe it all to these four brave young boys. [The four boys grin]
Townsman
Yeah! Alright!
Aide
And thanks to the bravery of this young man in particular, [Tweek smiles proudly] ...Hat McCullough is finally free from prison! [the smiles fade from the boys' faces]
Townsfolk
Yeah! Woohoohoo!
Kyle
...What? [a thin balding man with creepy appearance walks onstage and waves to everyone]
Townsfolk
Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat! Hat!
Hat McCullough
Thank you everyone-KILL! KILL THE INNOCENT!! Uh, I'm so thankful for all your support-RAPE THE VIRGINS!! And uh, I just wonder if i could get a baby real quick? [grins in a creepy way. The crowd falls silent for a moment]
Skeeter
Sure. Give that man a baby!
Townsfolk
Yeah! Woohoohoo! [the aide comes onstage holding a baby in his arms. Hat looks at the baby sinisterly. The baby senses this and quickly crawls up the aide's arm and onto his shoulder]
Stan
Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys turn and walk off. Tweek can't help but look at the baby's fate]
Tweek
Oh my God!
South Park, day. The boys walk away from the celebration and down the street.
Kyle
Do you think we did a good thing, Stan? [the boys stop] I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
Stan
Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
Cartman
That and youth. Those guys are old.
Tweek
But what about the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark? What if somebody else takes them and tries to change them?
Stan
Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
A secret warehouse. Someone packs all the original prints of Raiders of the Lost Ark into a large box. He nails the box shut and adds a lock. He puts the box on a dolly and carts it off down a long corridor. On each side are other boxes and crates of stuff put there so as not to cause any more harm to anyone. Among the stuff in the warehouse - RED CROSS 9/11 Relief Funds. Dramatic music plays the episode out.
End of Free Hat

Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society
Cartman's house, morning. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek show up. Stan rings the doorbell. Liane comes to the door.
Liane
Oh, hello boys.
Stan
Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
Liane
Oh, but I thought your teacher died.
Kyle
She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
Liane
Oh. Well, I'll tell Eric. He's just down in the basement playing with his dolls. [turns and walks off]
Tweek
Cartman likes to play with dolls?
Cartman's basement. He's playing with a rubber lamb at the edge of a hole in the floor.
Cartman
[strokes the lamb and sets it aside] Hello, Precious. Yes, that's a good Precious. [grabs a basket with a bottle of lotion sitting inside and lowers it down the hole. The basket stops when it reaches Polly Prissy Pants, which sits at the bottom of the hole] Now it takes the lotion from the basket.
Polly Prissy Pants
[Cartman voicing] Oh please, mister. Please let me out of here.
Cartman
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Precious
[Cartman voicing] Bark bark bark bark!
Cartman
Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
Polly Prissy Pants
Please, mister, let me out.
Cartman
It puts the lotion back in the basket!
Polly Prissy Pants
I miss my mom, mister. I wanna see my-
Cartman
[throws a fit] Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!
Liane
Sweetie.
Cartman
Yes, mom?
Liane
You have to get ready for school.
Cartman
[thinks a bit, then looks up] ...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?
Liane
Yes, but they said two weeks off was enough, and they want everyone back.
Cartman
[pause] Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
Liane
You'll get over it, honey.
Cartman
[starts to throw another fit] But I wanna plaaayyy.
South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade. The kids pour into the classroom, chattering. Wendy walks up and starts talking to Red and Annie.
Wendy
I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? [Bebe walks in]
Bebe
Hey guys.
Wendy
Hey Bebe.
Bebe
You guys, uh, [holds out her arms] notice anything different? [looks down at her body]
Wendy
[the three girls gaze] Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs!
Bebe
Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.
Mr. Mackey
[enters the classroom and walks past the girls] M'kay, kids, let's take our seats, m'kay? [the girls take their seats] I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?
Cartman
Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?
Mr. Mackey
No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems. [turns, grabs some chalk, and starts writing on the board] M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do, uh, four time four, m'kay?
Kyle
Dude, look at Bebe. ["We'll move into the five times thing." Bebe is busy taking notes. "We'll try five time three..."] Something seems different about her.
Stan
Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
Kyle
I don't know. [Bebe continues writing]
Clyde
Hey Token. You know, I never really noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.
Token
I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.
Butters
[pipes up behind Annie] Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh? [Bebe continues writing]
Cartman
Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
Craig
I don't know. Why?
Cartman
It just... It just seems like a really awesome shirt.
Craig
Yeah. It kinda does. [Bebe continues writing, but stops and looks to her right. All the boys are looking at her, all the girls look at the board.]
Mr. Mackey
Okay, and so uh, [Bebe is looking back, wondering why the boys keep staring at her] so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?
Bebe
[breaks the stare and answers] Oh, uh, forty-eight?
All the boys
Whoa.
Clyde
That is an awesome answer!
All the boys
Yeah!
Kyle
Dude! Bebe is really smart!
Stan
Yeah. I never noticed that before. Maybe she's actually cool enough to hang out with us.
Cartman
Yeah, may be.
South Park Elementary, later. Three girls walk to class: Wendy, Bebe, and Red. Wendy is talking.
Wendy
...But I was like, "I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars." [the girls stop and giggle]
Stan
[arriving with a group of boys: Kyle, Cartman, Token, Butters, Tweek, and Clyde] Ah, hey, Bebe.
Bebe
Yeah?
Stan
Uh, we're gonna go throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
Bebe
Really? [Wendy and Red look at her] I've never done that before.
Butters
[Stan and Kyle part a bit for a better view] Wuuhh, it's really fun. You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
Kyle
Yeah, it's cool.
Bebe
Well sure, that sounds hella fun.
The boys
Hahahahahaha...
Kyle
Yeah.
Stan
Hella fun.
Cartman
Right, heh.
Clyde
Wow, hella fun. That's awesome.
Token
I'm gonna start saying that now.
Stan
Cool. [the boys turn as one and walk back the way they came] We'll see you later, Bebe.
Wendy
[Wendy catches up to Stan. The boys are grinning. Stan stops and looks] Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.
Stan
That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. [turns and walks off]
Kyle
[looks over his shoulder] Yeah. She's really cool. [Wendy gets upset]
Clyde
It's weird how we never noticed before. [Wendy looks back at Bebe, who just shrugs]
A hill just outside of town. The boys and Bebe are gathered at the summit.
Stan
So what you do, see, is you wait for a car to drive by that big pine tree. Then you chuck a rock at it. It's all about the timing. [he throws a rock towards the road and the others look at the trajectory. A blue pick-up truck drives by and is hit]
Driver
You damn kids!
Bebe
Cool.
Clyde
You try it, Bebe.
Bebe
Okay.
Token
Here comes a sedan. [Bebe throws a rock at the red sedan and hits it]
Driver
You damn kids!
The boys
Awesome!
Butters
Cool! [close up] That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
Kyle
That was sweet, Bebe. [shows her another rock and another grip] Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
Clyde
Yeah. [grabs a hold of the rock and pulls it a bit] Here, it's like if you put your thumb on this side-
Kyle
[pulls back] I'm showing her.
Clyde
[pulls back] Yeah, just let me show her real quick how to put the thumb and-
Kyle
[gives an ape look and smacks Clyde, who lets go of the rock] Hoh!
Clyde
[grunts back and moves off] Hoh hoh hoh! [Bebe is stunned at this development]
Kyle
Hoh! [watches, then reverts to normal and talks to Bebe. Stan moves in] Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
Stan
[grabs the rock and demonstrates] Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
Kyle
[peeved] Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! [Bebe backs up, scared]
Stan
Hoh hoh hoh!
Kyle
Hah hah hah!
Craig
[beats his chest] Urh urh urh! [all the boys start grunting and displaying aggression]
Bebe
Uh. Listen guys, um, it's five-thirty. I'm supposed to get home, so... I'll see you later. [leaves. The boys continue grunting and putting on displays. She walks faster the farther she moves from the boys. The boys notice her absence and stop.]
Stan
[beat] ...Wait, what were we doing again?
Kyle
We were throwing rocks at cars.
The boys
Oh yeah.
Cartman
Woohoo.
Butters
[points] Uh there comes an SUV. [Token throws a rock and hits the SUV]
Jimbo
You damn kids!
South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are in their seats. Bebe is the last kid to enter class and find a seat.
The boys
Hi, Bebe.
Bebe
Hey everybody.
Wendy
[rolls her eyes and rests her head on her right hand] Oh, for Christ's sake!
Mr. Mackey
[arriving, puts his textbooks on the teacher's desk] M'kay. Kids, yesterday I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who wants to start? [Clyde raises his hand] M'kay, Clyde?
Clyde
[picks up his paper and starts] My paper is called, "Why Bebe is the coolest person, ever".
Stan
Hey, that's what I wrote about!
Butters
Me too!
Clyde
[grunts] Hoh!
Stan
[grunts and pounds his desk] Hah hah, hah! [the other boys start grunting like apes]
Mr. Mackey
Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.
Clyde
[glowers at Stan, then reads] "My friend Bebe is really smart. She tells funny jokes and knows a lot about stuff. She's good at almost everything she tries. She's awesome. The end." [some applause]
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token, why don't you read your paper?
Token
[picks up his paper and reads] "If I could be Bebe." [Wendy is miffed and rolls her eyes] "If I was Bebe, I would have lots of friends because I would be sooo great. I would make people smile and think wherever I went."
Mr. Mackey
[takes a moment to think, then] M'kay, interesting, Token. Uh... Who would like to go next? [the rest of the boys raise their hands energetically and make small sounds to get Mackey's attention] Uh, how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is?
The boys
[softly] Oh. [they lower their hands. Bebe raises hers]
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, Bebe?
Bebe
[picks up her paper and reads] "My cat Thumper."
The boys
Wwooww.
Bebe
[sees the reaction and continues reading] "Thumper is gray with a white spot. Sometimes he likes to chase his tail." [the boys break out in laughter]
Clyde
Chase his tail? That must be so funny!
Bebe
"Thumper is twelve years old. That's pretty old for a cat. The end."
The boys
Wwooww!
Cartman
God, you know what? That's so true. Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
Craig
That's true, huh? Man, that really makes me reflect on my pets.
Stan
That's such a great paper! [starts clapping. The other boys join in the applause]
Mr. Mackey
M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?
Wendy
[picks up her paper and reads] "The new Cold War."
Cartman
Oh God! Here we go again! Dork alert! [the boys crack up]
South Park Elementary cafeteria. Wendy is talking to Red, Millie, and Esther.
Wendy
But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-
Clyde
[arrives with Kyle, Token, Craig, Bradley, and Francis] Hey, have any of you dumb girls seen Bebe anywhere?
Wendy
[angrily] No!
Kyle
Maybe she's in the lunch line.
The boys
Yeah.
Wendy
Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
Millie
I can't stand her anymore! She's such a slut!
Esther
She's a total slut!
Red
You know what I heard? I heard that she made out with eight different boys in one minute.
Millie
I heard that she lifted her shirt to the boys at the bus stop.
Wendy
I heard that her asshole is like this big around. [makes a hole with her hands, thumb touching thumb, the other fingers touching their counterparts on the other hand]
Millie, Esther
Wwooww.
Bebe
[comes into view] Hey guys.
Wendy
Oh, hey Bebe. [fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [again] Slut.
Millie
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
Esther
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
Millie
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
Bebe
...You guys still wanna go ice-skating after school?
Wendy
Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner. [fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [again] Slut.
Millie
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
Esther
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
Red
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut.
Wendy
Slut.
Millie
[fakes a clearing throat] Slut. [the girls take their trays and leave, giggling]
Girls
[out of view] Whore. Slut. Slut.
Bebe's house, after school. She's looking out over the neighborhood from her bedroom window, looking sad. Her mother stops by her door and looks in.
Mrs. Stevens
Bebe, is something the matter?
Bebe
[turns and faces her mom] Oh Mom, it's just... My girlfriends at school said some really mean things to me today. [faces the window again and rests her head on her right hand] They called me a "slut with a huge gaping vagina".
Mrs. Stevens
[approaches] Oh, sweetie. You're all just growing up. [begins to stroke Bebe's hair] Part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next.
Bebe
But am I slutty just because I'm starting to be friends with guys? I mean, they just like me because they think I'm smart and cool.
Mrs. Stevens
I remember when I was a little girl the boys didn't think I was very smart at all. But then one day, they all started thinking I was really smart. I guess big smarts just run in our family.
Bebe
Well if the girls don't wanna be my friends, that's fine! [rests her head on her hands] Guys are way cooler, anyways.
King Jimmy's Buffet, night. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman sit at a booth eating hamburgers and some side dishes.
Tweek
[arrives] You... guys wanted me to meet you here?
Cartman
Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk.
Tweek
[sits next to Cartman] Oh God.
Cartman
[offers Tweek his plate] Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.
Stan, Kyle
True.
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
Yep.
Cartman
And, you know, we've been trying to fill the gap for the fourth friend ever since Kenny died, God rest his soul, and it hasn't been an easy process.
Kyle
Right.
Stan
Uh huh.
Cartman
And so, even though I think it's a tough thing to do right now, I think maybe it's best for everyone if we make room to allow Bebe to be our new fourth friend.
Kyle
Yeah.
Stan
That would be best.
Cartman
Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
Kyle
Huh??
Stan
Kyle??
Cartman
And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts]
Kyle
Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
Cartman
And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
Stan
Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!
Cartman
Pleeeeease???
Stan
No!
Cartman
[removes the watch and peanuts] Alright, fine! So then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that it's been really fun. Here's a watch and some peanuts. [presents the watch and peanuts again]
Kyle
No way! Tweek's cool!
Stan
Yeah!
Cartman
Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
Bus stop, next day. The answer is shown. Bebe stands between Kyle and Tweek, and Cartman is not present.
Bebe
Thanks for inviting me to ride the bus to school with you guys.
Stan
Sure thing, Bebe.
Cartman
[arrives] That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan! [leaves, then returns] Fuck you, Tweek! [leaves, then returns] Bebe, you're still cool. [leaves again]
South Park Elementary, hallway. Some boys - Clyde, Butters, Token, Craig, and Pip - are putting up a large poster that reads "Bebe for President" next to the counselor's office. Wendy passes by and stops to look.
Wendy
What are you doing?!
Clyde
We're trying to get Bebe to run for class president.
Wendy
I'm class president! The vote was last fall!
Craig
Well, yeah, but Wendy, you have to admit, Bebe's a lot smarter and more organized than you.
Token
[gushing] Yeah. We need a leader like Bebe. She can teach us all so much.
The Other Boys
Uh huh.
Wendy
She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! [the boys just look at her]
Clyde
What?
Wendy
Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid! [walks away in a funk]
Butters
[puts his fists on his hips] Stupider than Bebe!
Clyde
Yeah!
Craig
Yeah!
Butters
Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?
Clyde
Yeah!
Butters
Yeah!
Craig
Sure is!
Butters
Uhyep!
The neighborhood, after school. Stan, Kyle, and Tweek walk towards Bebe's house.
Kyle
I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
Stan
Yeah. [they arrive, but find four other boys arriving at the same time: Timmy, Kevin, Bradley, and Francis] Where are you guys going?
Bradley
We're going to see our friend Bebe.
Stan
Bebe is our friend. Didn't you all get the memo?
Francis
Bebe is everybody's friend.
Kevin
Yeah. God put Bebe on earth to enrich everyone's lives.
Stan
[steps forward and grunts] Hoh!
Kyle
[steps forward and grunts] Hoh hoh hoh!
Kevin
Arf arf!
Francis
Arf! [a few more grunts are heard]
Timmy
Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh!
Stan
Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. [goes and knocks on the door]
Mrs. Stevens
Oh, hello, boys.
Kyle
Is Bebe home?
Mrs. Stevens
No, she's with one of her little friends. But she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait.
Bradley
Who is she with?
Mrs. Stevens
I believe she is playing "Lambs" over at Eric Cartman's house.
Stan
Cartman's?
Cartman's basement. He's at his hole again, and Bebe is sitting next to him. He has his basket, lotion, and rubber poodle ready to go.
Cartman
[holds up the poodle] See, and this is Precious.
Bebe
Precious?
Cartman
[squeezes the poodle] Bark bark bark. [sets the poodle aside] Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket [puts the lotion in the basket] and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. [the basket descends]
Bebe
[watches the basket drop] Uh huh. [the basket stops once again in front of Polly Prissy Pants]
Cartman
Now you say, "It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again."
Bebe
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Cartman
Heheh, yeah.
Polly Prissy Pants
Mister, please let me out of here.
Cartman
Now say it again, louder.
Bebe
[louder] It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
Cartman
Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
Polly Prissy Pants
My parents have money, Mister. They'll give you whatever you want. Please!
Cartman
Now, just yell "Put the lotion in the fucking basket!"
Bebe
Put the lotion in the basket!
Cartman
Put the lotion in the fucking basket! [pushes the rubber poodle into the hole] Oh no! Precious!
Polly Prissy Pants
I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it! [a door is heard opening and Kyle goes down the steps, followed by Stan, Kevin, Craig, Clyde, Butters, Francis, Tweek, Bradley, Token, Pip, and Timmy]
Cartman
Now you say, "Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!"
Bebe
Don't you hurt my fucking dog!
Cartman
You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- [stops when he hears Timmy's wheelchair and looks around]
Kyle
What the hell are you doing?
Cartman
We're playing "Lambs."
Kyle
[moves over to Bebe] Bebe, I thought we were going to watch Terrance & Phillip today.
Butters
[moves forward] Then we gotta work on your campaign.
Francis
[moves forward] Right, but first we gotta go to the-
Stan
[jumps in front of Boy 2] Hoh! [the other boys begin to grunt and face each other]
Bebe
You guys, calm down!
Token tackles Bradley, Craig attacks Butters, Cartman punches Francis, Kyle attacks Kevin, Pip beats on Tweek, Bradley chases after Token, and Francis tosses Cartman over his head. Stan goes after Pip, but Pip attacks first. Clyde goes after Tweek and sends him flying across the basement. Token brings out a SuperBESTFriends lunchbox and throws it at Clyde. Clyde jumps out of the way and the lunchbox hits Timmy.
Timmy
Timmih!
Clyde attacks Token, but Token punches him away, then jumps on him. Timmy runs over both of them. Token jumps up and goes after Bradley again. Pip and Tweek fight again, and Stan comes flying in, taking Pip.
Bebe
This is insane!
Cartman picks Tweek up and throws him off. Francis is thrown backwards towards Bebe, back first. Bebe steps aside, and Francis hits the wall.
Bebe
Stop it you guys, please!
The map behind Bebe falls to the floor. Stan gets up, and Pip flies at him. Cartman and Bradley fight again. Kyle swings in from above on a hanging overhead light, landing on Cartman's back as Cartman fight Tweek. Tweek drops away, and Cartman has to wrestle Kyle. Bradley throws Token into a fossil display case, and a femur falls out. Stan walks up and looks at Token, then sees the femur. He picks it up and sees victory at hand. He starts beating everyone with the bone. He hits Clyde twice with it, and Clyde goes down. He then knocks out Kevin, then Cartman, then Kyle, then goes after the other boys.
Bebe
Oh boy, I never meant to cause all this trouble!
Stan
[atop a pile of boys] Hoh, hoh, hohhh! Hohhh! [he's knocked them all out and tossed them into a mound]
Bebe's house, day. She's at her window again, looking at the neighborhood. The boys are all over her front lawn milling around.
Mrs. Stevens
Bebe, those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if you'll come out.
Bebe
I know. They've been there all day. [Outside, Token messes with a trash can. Cartman notices and walks over, pushing the trash can down. Stan plays with a rock on the steps. Craig inches his way towards Stan, who watches him from time to time, and Francis is up a tree.]
Stan
Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!
Craig
Hah hah hahah hah! [the other boys turn and start grunting. Stan chases Craig away from the steps, then returns to sitting there.]
Stan
Hoh hoh hoh! [picks up his rock and plays with it] Hohohoh hoh!
Mrs. Stevens
Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers.
Bebe
Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?
Mrs. Stevens
Sweetie, you're just blossoming into a woman.
Bebe
But, I, I don't know if I want to. Sometimes I think I'm not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.
Mrs. Stevens
Sweetie, you're a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they're really, really smart. [gives her a hug and then leaves]
Bebe
Mom? [her mom stops and turns around] What's six times eight?
Mrs. Stevens
Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers. [satisfied, she turns around and walks out and downstairs. She opens the front door and the boys back away grunting] Alright boys, time to be getting home. Bebe's not feeling well and she can't come out today. Go on, shoo. [the boys walk away slowly, grunting in disappointment. A whistling sound is heard and a space shuttle crashes into a field across the street. The boys stop at the sight.]
Stan
Hoh. Hoh?
Astronaut 1
Aah. We made it.
Astronaut 2
Boys, can you call 9-1-1 for us? [the boys start to grunt again. Stan backs up into the crowd of boys]
Astronaut 1
Oh my God. We've landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over!
Astronaut 2
I knew it! You blew it up, didn't you?!
Astronaut 1
I don't want to live in this futuristic madness! [pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]
Astronaut 2
Take your ape rule and go to hell! [pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]
Bebe
[sighs] Having boobs sucks.
Hell's Pass Hospital, later. A man walks in and goes to his desk.
Dr. Hallis
Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today? [sits at his desk]
Bebe
I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. [the doctor leans forwards and visually inspects Bebe's chest]
Dr. Hallis
You?
Bebe
Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.
Dr. Hallis
Well, young lady, I'm afraid that we don't offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age.
Bebe
Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can't I have mine taken off?
Dr. Hallis
Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.
Bebe
I think it's insane to want them bigger.
Dr. Hallis
Why do you... hate your breasts so?
Bebe
Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.
Dr. Hallis
Oh, come on now, that's just silly.
Blonde Nurse
[nice shape, walks in with a folder] Here's the Anderson file, Doctor.
Dr. Hallis
[looks up, looks down and grins, then looks up again] Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That's great. Oh, God-damn. Thank you so much. [The nurse walks out. Bebe lowers her eyelids halfway]
Brunette Nurse
[not as nicely shaped, walks in with a cup and plate] And here's the coffee you wanted, doctor.
Dr. Hallis
[quickly, subdued, looks askance] Yeah, whatever. Get out of here. [the nurse walks out, and he addresses Bebe again] Now, I was saying?
Bebe
Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.
Dr. Hallis
Yeah, so? That's great, isn't it?
Bebe
No it's not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I'm gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I'm handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.
Dr. Hallis
That may be true, but I'm afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl.
Bebe
Damnit!
Dr. Hallis
If, on the other hand, you'd like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?
Bebe
Oh, fuck off! [walks off in disgust]
Stan's house, day. In the dining room Randy reads the paper. Sharon enters.
Sharon
Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?
Randy
Why? What's the matter with him?
Sharon
It's just that, well, he's been acting a little different lately. [Randy looks. In the living room Stan has taken out his crayons and drawn some figures on the wall]
Stan
[disheveled, in his primal state] Aaaa-ta. [starts drawing another boob. The wall is covered with them, singly or in pairs. One stick-figure woman has a large pair] Aaaa-ta.
Sharon
He's been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can't figure out why.
Stan
[picks up a stick and moves it around] Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
Randy
Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
Sharon
[relieved and proud] Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. [Randy leaves his seat at the table and approaches Stan]
Stan
[points to the wall with his stick] Ahta. Ah, ahta!
Randy
Hey there, son.
Stan
[turns to face his father] Hoh? Ahta. [points to the wall] Ahta.
Randy
Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.
Stan
Ahta.
Randy
Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.
Stan
Ahta? [Sharon walks behind Randy and sits on one of the sofa's arms]
Randy
But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.
Stan
[considers each argument] Friends. Ahta.
Randy
I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday, [places his left hand on Sharon's right shoulder. She smiles] you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.
Sharon
[putting her right arm around Randy] I love you.
Randy
If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.
Bebe's house, night. The house is dark, so she's asleep. The camera zooms in on her, and her breasts start to blink under her gown.
Right Breast
The boys are at war. All is going as planned.
Left Breast
Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees.
Right Breast
We grow larger every day.
Left Breast
And stronger.
Right Breast
Soon the entire tow- [Bebe awakens]
Left Breast
Sh! Sh! She's awake!
Right Breast
Ah, quiet.
Bebe
[shrieks and kicks her blanket off] MOM!! MOM!!
Mrs. Stevens
[rushes to Bebe's room and enters] What is it, Bebe?
Bebe
[scared] My breasts!
Mrs. Stevens
[approaches the bed, sits, and holds her] Oh, sweetheart, you're just becoming a young lady.
Bebe
No, they're conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!
Mrs. Stevens
[beat] Yes, darling, your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older. They feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can. You're blossoming into a woman. [hugs her]
Bebe
That does it! I'm NOT letting these things run my life!
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Dr. Hallis walks in with a file and quickly addresses his prospective client.
Dr. Hallis
Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?
Wendy
Yes! I want to get breast implants!
Mrs. Testaburger
I tried to tell her she was too young.
Dr. Hallis
Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant.
Mrs. Testaburger
[considers the doctor's argument...] But she's eight!
Dr. Hallis
Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty.
Wendy
That's what I said.
Dr. Hallis
However, young lady, I'm afraid breast implants are not for everyone. [takes out a notepad] I'll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go.
Wendy
I have three thousand dollars, cash. [her mom blanches]
Dr. Hallis
[quickly disposes of the pad and pen, then rises and leaves the desk] You pass. Let's do this thing.
Mrs. Testaburger
[mortified] Oh, wait. You're gonna do it right now?
Dr. Hallis
Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure. [holds Wendy's right arm up and points to the armpit] What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won't be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.
Mrs. Testaburger
I still don't know about this.
Dr. Hallis
Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone's self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?
Operating room, moments later. Wendy is hooked up and sedated. The first incision is made to the left armpit and the flesh pulled back hard. The nurse hands the doctor the first implant, which he shoves in Wendy's chest.
Dr. Hallis
[shove] Cha! [shove] Gotta! [shove] Jam it! [shove] Up there! [shove] Get! [shove] In! [shove] There! [shove] You! [shove] Bitch! [shoves faster] Get! [shove] In! [shove] There! [shove] You! [shove] Bitch! [the implant is finally in place; everything is covered in blood] Hah! [wipes his brow] Okay, there's one, Wendy. Doing great.
South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Mackey is back teaching the class. The kids are at their seats. The boys are being apes, and the girls look scared.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades.
Clyde
[in primal mode] Bebe! Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe! [he and a few others grunt a bit]
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay? [the grunts start up again]
Bradley
Bebe! [more grunts.]
Stan
Ahta! [more grunts. Bebe enters wearing a cardboard box over her clothes. The boys quiet down.]
Bebe
Hey guys. [a few boys grunt back with "Hi!!" "Hey." "Hm." as she heads for her seat. The boys are confused.]
Craig
Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn't as cool as she used to be? [Bebe smiles at her uncoolness]
Token
Yeah. What the hell happened to us?
Stan
Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe's boobs.
Cartman
Bebe's boobs?
Bebe
Oh cool! It worked!
Stan
Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
Kyle
Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
Bebe
Yes!
Cartman
So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
Bebe
Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.
Kyle
But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
Stan
I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
Clyde
Yeah. Screw boobs! They're stupid!
Craig
I'm sorry for fighting, you guys. [all the boys leave their seats and start apologizing to each other, hugging each other]
Mr. Mackey
[moved by this display of affection] Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?
Clyde
Let's never let boobs come between us again!
The Boys
Hear Hear!
Kyle
Boobs are stupid!
Wendy
[enters with her new, ample implants] Hi, everybody. [the boys look at her for a long while, then start laughing heartily. Wendy is stunned at the response]
Clyde
Look at those ridiculous things!
Butters
[steps up and touches the left breast] Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!
Cartman
What a stupid bitch! [the boys start laughing again. Butters is laughing hard, but realizes that his finger is still on Wendy's breast.]

Child Abduction is Not Funny
Tweek's house, night. He's on the sofa looking at news.
News Anchor
[News 4] And in other news, another school shooting has taken place, this time in Idaho. As these kinds of shooting increase, one thing becomes clear: Your children are not safe at school.
Tweek
Oh God! [frantically fishes for the remote control] Change it! Change it! [finds it and changes channels]
News Anchor
[News 5] This was the second time a terrorist threat has been made on a theme park, leaving everyone to realize that children are not safe outside.
Tweek
Agh! God, change it!! [clicks through a few channels]
News Anchor
[SNN, with weather bar at bottom] And it seems there's a new danger to look out for: children who are taken by strangers. The bottom line: children are not safe... in their own homes!
Tweek
[throws a fit] Aaaah!!
Mrs. Tweak
[arrives] Tweek.
Tweek
Gahahghah!
Mrs. Tweak
Tweek? Come to the kitchen, sweetie. We need to see you real quick. [leaves. Tweek soon follows]
Kitchen. Richard is at table as Tweek arrives. Tweek's mom is serving coffee. There are two coffee makers in the background.
Tweek
Oh God. They're gonna get me.
Richard
Sit down and have some coffee, son. [Tweek climbs onto his seat and takes a sip, then several more] Tweek, there's starting to be a lot of reports in the news about children being abducted, and we thought we should talk.
Tweek
[points to the TV] I s-I saw! Uuuh!
Mrs. Tweak
You know never to talk to strangers, right Tweek? You can't trust anybody.
Tweek
[panting] Oh God! Huh!
Richard
Now, we don't want to alarm you, son, but we've installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door. It's important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and I.
Tweek
[panting] Oh Jesus! Huh!
Mrs. Tweak
It's just a precaution, sweetie. Probably nothing will ever happen.
The Tweek house, after bedtime. Tweek is in his bed having a nightmare.
Tweek
No, ...NO! They're gonna get me! [wakes up] GAAAH! Huh, huh, huh-oh, oh God. [holds himself] Uh, just a dream. [gasps. His bedroom windows are open and the curtains are softly blowing in the breeze] OH MY GOD!! [quickly jumps up and closes the windows. Four knocks are heard at the door] GAAAH!! [throws the blanket over his head. Two more knocks, and then]
Voice
[on the other side of the door] Tweek! This is Officer Daniels! Now, try and stay calm, but we believe an abductor is in your room!
Tweek
...Inside my room? Oh God!
Voice
Give it up, buddy! We've got ya surrounded! Okay, Tweek, I want you to very calmly but quickly walk to the door and come out to us!
Tweek
[thinks and looks around] Oh my God! [hops down and makes his way to the door] Oh! Oh! Jesus, see me through this. [opens the door and steps out, only to find a gun to his face. He gasps, then] AAAHH!
Voice
Bang! [the gun is withdrawn] You're dead, Tweek. [the camera zooms out to show Mr. Tweek holding the gun]
Tweek
[look up bewildered] What?
Richard
You failed the test, son. Didn't I tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and I?
Tweek
[a bit panicked] Oh God! Oh Jesus!
Mrs. Tweak
[walks up and stands next to Richard at the doorway] What if that had been a child abductor pretending to be a police officer, Tweek?
Richard
He would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods. [Tweek shakes his head in frustration and whimpers] You've got to be on your toes, Tweek. Alright, now go to bed and get some rest.
Mrs. Tweak
'Night, pumpkin. [his dad closes the door and locks it, then the parents go off to bed. Tweek turns to go to bed, but looks distraught]
The Bijou, next day. "Men In Black II" is showing. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Tweek walk up to the ticket booth.
Stan
I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
Kyle
It will.
Cartman
[orders his ticket first] One please.
Tweek
[stopping Cartman] Wait, that's not the usual ticket-taker guy!
Kyle
So?
Tweek
So? I don't know him!
Cartman
Dude, relax.
Tweek
You relax! What if he wants to kill me?! AAAAAAAA!! [runs away]
Cartman
Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
Down the road. Tweek is running, but soon tires out. A car pulls up and the driver looks out the passenger window.
Driver
'Scuse me, is this the right road to Breckenridge.
Tweek
[looks up] AAH! Uh...
Driver
Please, I just need to know if this is "South Park"?
Tweek
Get away from meee! [runs off again. The confused driver looks at him go]
A street corner. Tweek arrives there and stops to catch his breath. An elderly lady walks up and taps his hair. Tweek screams and jumps back. The crossing signal says "WALK," so it's alright for both to cross the street.
Elderly Lady
Could you help me across the street?
Tweek
I don't know you! [runs across the street] Ah, AAAH!
The outskirts of town. Tweek is running and arrives at some train tracks. A man in a wheelchair sits between the tracks. He looks behind to see that no one has followed him.
Man in Wheelchair
Oh, hey, kid! [Tweek looks over] Oh, thank God you happened by. My- my chair ran out of juice right on these train tracks. If you hadn't had shown up, well... Well, anyway, could you give me a push?
Tweek
Huh uh!
Man in Wheelchair
No, no, you don't understand. I'm, I'm paralyzed from the neck down. I push the chair with this device in front of my mouth, but it's it's not working, so you see-
Tweek
I'm not supposed to talk to you!
Man in Wheelchair
Please, this, this isn't funny, kid. You have to help me.
Tweek
But it could be a trick! [a train zooms by, taking the paralyzed man with it. Tweek watches it go by] Ugh. That's a pretty good trick.
The Tweek house, night. Tweek is again asleep, peacefully. A light fills the room and rouses him from his sleep. At the foot of the bed is a man dressed in a robe. He holds a scepter in his right hand and wears laurel branches on his head. He is glowing, as is the bauble atop the scepter.
Tweek
AaaaAAAHH! [hides under his covers]
Man
[speaking with authority] Relax, Tweek. I am not here to hurt you. I am the Ghost of Human Kindness.
Tweek
[peeks out from behind the covers] The Ghost of Human Kindness?
The Ghost of Human Kindness
You have never seen the likes of me before.
Tweek
What do you want?
The Ghost of Human Kindness
You have lost faith in humanity, lad. Something I cannot bear to see happen.
Tweek
Huh-uh, how can I help it? It seems that everywhere I turn, someone is out to get me.
The Ghost of Human Kindness
That is the world of the news reports. It is the world that adults preoccupy themselves with, but it is not the world as it is.
Tweek
It isn't?
A woman enters the Shady Acres Retirement Community and heads for the front door. Tweek and the ghost arrive and follow her in.
The Ghost of Human Kindness
Look here, Tweek. This woman is on her way to the retirement home. [they arrive at the front door] She doesn't get paid; she volunteers her time to talk with lonely elderly people who want nothing more than a friend. [the woman hugs an elderly lady, then moves on to other folks.] But do you hear about her on the news? No.
A one-story house, later. Tweek and the ghost reach the front window.
The Ghost of Human Kindness
Now gaze upon this humble house, Tweek. Inside there are two people who have adopted needy children. [a close-up of a man reading to his baby. Two other kids, a Japanese girl and a black boy, sit on the floor listening. The mother arrives with drinks] They were strangers to those kids once. Now they are loving parents.
The camera looks at a snowy sky with a full moon and pans down. Tweek and the ghost are walking down the highway.
The Ghost of Human Kindness
Now, look here, boy. [a shot of a man changing the front left tire of a Cadillac for an elderly lady. A young woman stands ready with a spare tire] A car has broken down with a flat tire, and two complete strangers have stopped to help. [the man signals for the tire, the woman rolls it to him] Will their kindness be reported on the news tomorrow? I think not.
South Park. Tweek and the ghost are back in town.
The Ghost of Human Kindness
Are you starting to understand, boy?
Tweek
I think so. You mean that, even though all the news is about murderers and abductors, those kind of people... only make up a very small part of the world.
The Ghost of Human Kindness
That's right, lad. So do you think you can learn to trust people now?
Tweek
I'll... try.
The Ghost of Human Kindness
Good. Then why don't you get into the back of my van, and I'll drive you home. [the camera pans to a dirty dilapidated van]
Tweek
Your van? [flashlights click on and focus on the ghost and at least five squad cars pull up to the two people]
Officer 1
Alright Johnson, give it up!
The Ghost of Human Kindness
[strikes his scepter to the ground with each expletive] Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn! [four officers close in with guns drawn. Tweek steps aside] Oh, I was so close!
Tweek
What the hell is going on?
Mrs. Tweak
Tweek, Tweek, are you okay?
Richard
Did he hurt you, son?
Tweek
No.
Detective
Then we aren't too late. His name is Frederick Johnson. He's been abducting children by dressing up like the Ghost of Human Kindness for over a year now.
The Ghost of Human Kindness
And I would have gotten away with it again if it weren't for you meddling policemen! [the policemen escort him away. A wide shot shows the Stotches, the Williamses and the Marshes viewing the arrest in their pajamas. Liane Cartman walks up in her gown. She's wearing a facial treatment mask]
Liane
What's going on?
Sharon
A stranger was caught trying to abduct the Tweak boy.
Sheila
[the Broflovskis arrive in their pajamas] An abductor in our town?
Steve
Oh my God, what are we gonna do?
South Park City Hall, next day. The townsfolk are clamoring outside the front door.
Townsfolk
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
Mayor McDaniels
People, people, calm down.
Randy
Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!
Townsfolk
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
Mayor McDaniels
Yes, but standing out here yelling "Rabble rabble rabble" isn't going to help anything.
Jimbo
Well we don't know what else to do, Mayor!
Townsfolk
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble.
Mayor McDaniels
People, what do you think we need to do?
Gerald
[thinks] Uh, well, we need to find a way to close our town off from unwanted strangers!
Sheila
Yes, we need a barrier to protect our kids.
Townsfolk
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble...
Randy
Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.
Richard
That's... not a bad idea, a city wall.
Sheila
But who can we get to build it?
City Wok, later. Several adults are in the restaurant.
Mayor McDaniels
...And so, we want you to design and build a great wall, all around the city.
Tuong Lu Kim
I don' build wall. I just own un' operate City Wok.
Gerald
We just think that you're the best person to put up a wall. We're sure you've got it in your blood.
Tuong Lu Kim
[thinks a moment] Oh, I get it. Just because I Chinese, you think I build wall. That i' bullshit! I'm not stereotype, okay?! Just because I'm Chinese doesn't mean I go around building wall! I'm just a normal person like all o'you! I eat ahrice and drive ahreally slow, just like the rest o'you! I'm not stereotype!
Sharon
Please, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim.
Randy
Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
Outside South Park, some weeks later. A great wall has gone up around South Park, enclosing it like a medieval wall. This is the Great Wall of South Park. Tuong, dressed in his restaurant's uniform, is laying down some bricks. He hears some horses and look up. Some Mongolians have arrived and drawn their swords. They chip away at the wall.
Tuong Lu Kim
Hey. Hey hey! [rushes over to the gap the Mongolians are creating] Hey, what the hell you doing?! [the Mongolian leader says a few words] Mongorians? What the hell Mongorians doing here? [the Mongolians keep attacking the wall] Ey, fuck you, Mongorians! Tryin' break down my wall! [starts throwing bricks at the Mongolians] Get out of here, fuckin' Mongorians! [the Mongolians turn and ride away] God-damnit, how come every time us Chinese put up a wall, stupid Mongorians have to come and knock it down?
South Park, now encircled by the Great Wall, later.
The Marsh house, living room. Stan is on the sofa watching TV. His parents enter. Randy is carrying a box.
Randy
Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.
Stan
Child Tracker?
Sharon
It's a little electrical device that can tell us where you are anywhere on Earth.
Randy
If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
Moments later, Randy finishes installing the Tracker, and both parents smile.
Randy
There, I think that's got it. [Stan is now wearing a very elaborate helmet with several antennae, a red light, and a small satellite dish sitting on top.]
Stan
...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
Randy
You can barely even tell you have one on.
Stan
I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
Sharon
I wouldn't worry about that.
School bus stop, next day. Stan is wearing his tracker. Kyle, Cartman, and Tweek are wearing their own trackers. All trackers are activated.
Cartman
So weak. So weak, dude. Man.
Kyle
Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
Tweek
I didn't mean to.
The Great Wall of South Park. Tuong finishes the repairs on the damaged section.
Tuong Lu Kim
Okay. Finary. [looks around] Oh no. [picks up a telescope, with "Mongolian Telescope written on it and looks through it. He finds the Mongolians attacking the wall at a position far off] It's those God-damned Mongorians again! Stop! Stop right there, Mongorians! [a shot from inside a tower of Tuong running down the rampart] God-damnit, stop! [a far shot of Tuong running down the rampart] Stop breaking down my city wall you stupid Mongoriaaans! [finally arrives at the source of the noise] Ay, you sons of bitches, you- [sees a ruse. Clothes were placed on twigs and a tape player plays a recording of Mongolian noises] What the hell? [straightens up] Oh, shit! [looks off to his right to see the Mongolians attacking the part of the wall he was at before] OH, GOD-DAMNED MONGORIANS!! [runs back along the rampart to the Mongolians] I'm gonna get you, fuckin' Mongorians! Don't break down my city wall! [reaches the new gap and the Mongolians ride away] Oh, God-damnit! [the Mongolian leader says something. Tuong calls out after them] That's the last time you're gonna break down my city wall! You hear me, Mongorians?! [goes about repairing the wall] God-damned Mongorians.
A baseball field. A cheer comes up from the bleachers. A close-up shows the townsfolk rooting for their Cows.
Richard
Alright, Cows, We're gonna go out there and we're gonna give 'em hell! [the boys are wearing their Child Trackers. Cartman is the catcher, Stan is the pitcher]
Kyle
But, wait. Where's the other team? [the field is shown. The opposing bullpen is empty and there are no opposing players on the field. There's no visiting team out there.]
Randy
There is no other team.
Stan
Huh?
Richard
Well, we've... put a wall around the city to keep outsiders out. You don't think we want a bunch of strangers coming in to play ball, do you?
Stan
But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
Randy
Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. [takes a sip of his beer. Richard sips from his beer can, then other townsfolk in the bleachers sip from their beer cans. The Cows take positions on the field]
Townsfolk
Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows! Go Cows!
Jimbo
[umpire] Play ball! [Stan looks at the people in the stands, then pitches to Cartman] Steeeeee-riiike!!
Townsfolk
[standing and cheering] Yeah! Woohoo! Yeah!
Crust E. Krotch's Pizza, Corral, night. The town is in there celebrating a victory. Ned is playing "Thirst For Blood".
Jimbo
[raises a mug of beer] South Park Cows do it again!
Sharon
Congratulations on your victory, boys. [Cartman is already eating a slice of pizza]
Kyle
Dude, we weren't playing anybody.
Randy
Yeah, and you kicked ass!
Roger
Isn't it awesome havin' a great wall around our city? Nobody in town except for our good friends.
Townsfolk
Yeahah! Alright! Yeah. Right on! Right on!
Richard
[calling attention to the TV] Guys! Sh, quiet everyone. [the news is on]
News Anchor
[in gray jacket] And this newest study reveals more about child abductions than we apparently knew before, Tom. [the adults move closer to the TV]
Sharon
Turn it up.
Tom
[in brown jacket] That's right, Chris. This newest study shows that the majority of child abductions are NOT committed by strangers, but by somebody the child knows in their own town. [the adults start looking at the others around them, at each other.] The report further states that it is because the child trusts the individual that problems occur in the first place.
Chris
Well, I guess this means the enemy is in our own backyard, so to speak.
Tom
Sure does, Tom.
Chris
Alright, thanks, Chris. Is the weather going to turn su- [click. The parents go to their kids and they depart one by one]
Richard
Well, if you'll all excuse us, I think we'll be going now. [takes Tweek, and the family leaves. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman remain, eating]
Gerald
[walks up] Yeah. Come along, Kyle [the Broflovskis leave. Stan and Cartman remain]
Sharon
Stanley, time for us to get back to the house.
Stan
[mouth full] I'm not done with my pizza.
Sharon
NOW, Stanley! [whisks him off. Randy follows, looking at Cartman, left all alone with his mom]
The Great Wall of South Park. Tuong is working on something behind a brick shield.
Tuong Lu Kim
Eh. Eh, eh, there we go. [pulls out a large weapon] All finished. My Mongolian Missile Defense system. [a bazooka reading "MONGOLIAN ERADICATOR." He mounts it on his shoulder and takes aim. Next, he sets it down and drops a missile into it] Those Mongolians try to break down my city wall again, they gonna get a big heat-seeking missile surprise! [hoofbeats are heard and the Mongolians are once again present and ready to attack. Tuong sees them and taunts them] Oh! Hello Mongolians. Yeah. You come to break down my city wall? [the leader holds out a baseball] Oh, you gonna throw that baseball at my wall? [feigns despair] Oh no! Not a baseball! I'm pretty scared. [the leader tosses the ball in the air straight up] Well, you know what? I might have something here that's a little bigger than a baseball. [arms himself with the bazooka, setting it at hip level] Say hello to my little friend! [fires the missile and watches it go towards the Mongolians. One of the Mongolians pours gasoline on the ball. The leader reaches back to get a lighter from another Mongolian and sets the ball on fire. The missile gets close to them. The leader throws the ball at Tuong and the missile follows the ball. The ball hits the wall and drops to the snow. Tuong realizes what this means] Aw, crap. [the missile strikes the ball and blows a new gap into the great wall. After the smoke clears, Tuong is lying in the rubble, clearly hurt] Ooohhhh [the leader draws his sword and the Mongolians have a good laugh about this incident. Then they turn and ride off, laughing.] God-damned Mongolians!! You break down my city wall foda last time!!
South Park, the bus stop, next day. The parents are present with the boys as they wait for the school bus.
Stan
Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.
Richard
'Sokay, boys. Just act as if we weren't here.
Sharon
Right. Do what you normally would do.
Kyle
[volunteers] You're such a fatass, Cartman.
Cartman
At least I'm not a stupid Jew.
Sheila
What what whaaat?
South Park Elementary. The bell rings and the class begins. Mr. Mackey is at the board.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place? [a shot of the class with all parents present] Uh, how about you, Clyde?
Roger
[whispers into Clyde's ear] Nineteen six-
Mr. Mackey
No helping! [Mr. Donovan looks around, embarrassed, and stands up] M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay?
Richard
Well, maybe things would be better if we could trust people like the Stotches!
Stephen
Us? Your family's always been the shifty-eyed ones!
Richard
Oh yeah?! [the other parents begin to bicker]
Mr. Mackey
Oh, this is too much to take. [goes to his desk, where his own parents wait, and sits down.] Mom, Dad, could you please leave me alone?
Mr. Mackey's Father
We just wanna make sure nobody hurts you, Junior, m'kay?
Mr. Mackey
M'kay.
Great Wall of South Park. Mr. Lu Kim wheels a vat of boiling fluid to one of the openings.
Tuong Lu Kim
Hahahaha! My masterpiece! [stirs his concoction] When those Mongolians come next time, I pour this sweet and sour pork on their heads. Haha, sweet and sour pork so hot and sticky, Mongolians'll stick ahright up to the wall! And scream "UhwOoOoOoOoo!" Oh I can't wait. [hears something to his left. He looks and sees a wooden horse on wheels rolling up to the gate. He studies the horse and tries to think what to make of it] Oh, I get it. A Trojan Mongolian horse. Mongolians a-hiding inside thinking that I'll bring it in city wall, then Mongolians pop out and destroy wall from the inside out without gettin' any sweet and sour pork on their heads! Okay. I'll pray around. [starts to feign gratitude, moves to the rampart above the gate] Oh! Oh rook! Rook, my very own Mongorian Trojan horse! Gee, what a surprise! I guess Mongorians aren't such crappy, smelly people after all! [makes his way down the stairs near a tower and reaches the side door] Yeah. Great! Rwow! [opens the side door and walks over to the horse carrying a fireman's ax.] Yeah, what a great present! I'm just gonna push it inside the gate and show it to all my friends. [pulls down a door handle under the horse. Two doors open above him and release some seweet and sour pork on him, forcing him to the ground. He finds it hard to move around] Oh, it's sweet and sour pork! [The Mongolians ride up again and attack the wall with their swords. Tuong speaks, but his words become less familiar, due to the stickiness of the sauce] Oh! I'm going to get you Nogodians, if it's the last thing I do!
The Tweek house, night. The parents are in the living room sitting together on the sofa watching TV and sharing a bag of popcorn. A blanket covers their legs. The surroundings show an iron door where the front door is, and roll-down iron blinds over the windows.
News Anchor
[News 4] And so all the residents of Manhattan are prepared to evacuate if Ms. Clinton's ass gets any bigger. And in other news, new findings on the increase in child abductions.
Richard
Oh Jesus, turn it up, honey!
News Anchor
The study shows that the most likely abductors of children... are the parents themselves! [the two adults are somewhat stunned] The study reveals that nine out of every ten abduction cases are committed by the child's mother or father. The bottom line being that your children aren't safe, even from you! [Tweek's mom rises from the couch and walks away from it. Richard watches her go]
Richard
Where are you going?
Mrs. Tweak
Uh. I'm just going to go upstairs and see if Tweek is still in his bed.
Richard
Oh? [puts the popcorn and blanket aside and rises] I think I'll go with you.
Mrs. Tweak
It's okay. I can do it.
Richard
I just want to make sure that you-
Mrs. Tweak
That I don't abduct him? How do I know that you haven't done it already?
Richard
Me? I would never abduct our son!
Mrs. Tweak
That's not what the new study says!
Richard
[wipes his forehead, then] Well what are we supposed to do, eh-? How can we protect Tweek from ourselves? [both parents look upstairs]
South Park, next day. The families gather on a neighborhood street. The parents are hugging their kids.
Randy
[hands Stan some money] Here you go, Stanley. This should hold you over for three years.
Stan
But why do I have to leave?
Randy
The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.
Sharon
Good-bye, son. [hugs Stan and sobs softly] Remember to eat right.
Gerald
[wistfully] Look out for your brother, Kyle. You're the man now.
Sheila
Oh, boys! Don't ever forget that we love you! [Gerald hugs Kyle, Sheila hugs Ike. They begin to cry, and the other adults follow. They leave their kids and huddle, then turn around, crying all the while]
Linda
Be careful out there!
Stan
Where are we supposed to go?
Randy
We can't tell you because we can't know where you are! [turns back to cry with Sharon]
Sheila
Oh, this is terrible! [turns and cries with Gerald]
Roger
Go on, kids! Go! Go and don't look back! [turns and hugs his wife. The adults are bawling now. Token is the first to leave, and the other kids follow him]
Randy
Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you. [the adults continue crying. Stephen pulls out a ram's horn and blows into it a few times]
Stan
Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
A Woman
[in the crowd, crying] Oh my God.
The Great Wall of South Park, day. Tuong is still congealed under the sweet and sour sauce the Mongolians dumped on him, but the Trojan Mongolian horse is gone. A dog walks by and sniffs.
Tuong Lu Kim
Ah. Hey daw. O'er 'ere. O'er 'ere, dog. Got som'in sweet and souh foh ya. [the dog walks over and starts licking the sauce away] Good dog! That's it! Keep licking, dog!
Some time later. Tuong runs along the ramparts of the wall, finally freed from the sweet and sour pork that had held him in place.
Tuong Lu Kim
Hahahahahaaa! I'm free, Mongolians! And now I'm gonna make you PAY!
The Marsh house, night. Randy is at the sofa watching the news.
News Anchor
Finally, some good news tonight. It's been several days since any child abductions have taken place. The main reason: parents don't know where their children are. [Sharon, at the window, sighs. Randy turns and looks at her. Snow flakes float down outside]
Randy
What's the matter? [stands up]
Sharon
Oh, it's just... I was wondering if Stan's okay.
Randy
[walks up to her] Oh, I'm sure he's made it somewhere safe by now. [puts his hand on her back]
Sharon
Do you really think we did the right thing, Randy? Sending all the young kids in town off to live on their own?
Randy
[faces her, makes her face him] Sweetheart, you saw the news...
Sharon
I know. [they turn back to the window]
Randy
Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.
A Mongolian camp outside the Great Wall of South Park, night. The Mongolians are roasting and enjoying small animals, and drying the hides near a tent. The town's kids are now with them, wearing new clothes.
Leader
Tah tane da ke ab kahleh kalabush.
Stan
Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. [the Mongolians laugh]
Mongolian
[in blue] De bandig baeakhalah?
Cartman
Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
Tweek
Triben fak burushban.
All
Shain balag!
The Great Wall of South Park, day. Tuong pops up outside the wall dressed in imperial attire.
Tuong Lu Kim
Awright, Mongolians! Your only way through this wall is through me. This is my rast stand! I'm gonna do my war dance now. [begins a chant and dances for a few seconds, then stops] Does my war dance ascare you, Mongolians? Yeah, you think you want a piece of this? [resumes his dance. Seeing Tuong engrossed in his dance, the children move some explosives to a spot against the wall. Token peeks to make sure everything is in place. The kids then walk back to the Mongolians, past Tuong...] This is ancient Chinese dance of a- Oh, herro kids. Uh be careful, there's a-Mongolians up there. [resumes his dance as the kids line up before the Mongolians. Stan hands the detonator to the Mongolian leader, who holds it for a while. Tuong notices the wire stretching between the Mongolians and the explosives against the wall] Oh, crap! [the explosives blow up, knocking Tuong towards the Mongolians and leaving a big gap in the wall. The kids and the Mongolians have a good laugh. The adults in town come to see the commotion]
Randy
What's going on?
Liane
I heard an explosion.
Tuong Lu Kim
[battered, comes into view] God-damned Mongolians attacked city wall again! [The kids and the Mongolians have a good laugh again.]
Man in Back
Mongolians?
Randy
What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
Adults
Rabble rabble rabble rabble!
Richard
Wait a minute. Those Mongolians are... our children. [a shot of the kids and Mongolians]
Sheila
Ike? Kyle?
Sharon
My son has become a Mongolian? No! Noooo!! [buries her head in Randy's chest]
Richard
Oh God. What have we done? We sent our children away, and now they don't even remember who they are.
Roger
Kids? Don't you remember us?
Randy
Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college. [steps forth] Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.
Stan
["Budu e noo"] Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. [squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his right hand]
Randy
Bi kute.
Roger
We are your parents. You used to live here, with us.
Kyle
Yeah, it was like four days ago!
Richard
They're starting to remember.
Randy
[walks quickly and kneels next to Stan] Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!
Stan
Uh huh, Stan Marsh.
Randy
[holds Stan firmly] That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber! [the rest of the parents rush out and hug their own kids, crying in relief]
Richard
We're sorry, Tweek!
Roger
Are you okay, Clyde?
Stephen
[Butters' parents hug the wrong person - the Mongolian leader] Oh, son, can you ever forgive us?
Butters
Huh, I'm over here, Dad.
Stephen
Oh. [he and Linda rush to hug him]
Sheila
We're sorry, kids. We just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads.
Richard
Oh my God, do you see what this means? The Ghost of Human Kindness was right all along.
Roger
You mean how he said we should trust each other, or how he abducted children?
Richard
The uh... no, the part about being more trusting. We should follow what he said, not what he did.
Adults
Wow, yeah. Oh yeah.
Randy
No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians. [a shot of the Mongolians] They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.
Adults
Whoa! Wow. Right!
Stephen
Yeah, the Mongolians were right. Yeah.
Tuong Lu Kim
Aw, you'd better not say what I think you're gonna say.
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall!
Tuong Lu Kim
Oh, God! I hate this whole shitty!
Sharon
Randy, can we just take our son home now?
Randy
Yes, kids. [steps forward] With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. [all turn and walk towards town through the gap in the great wall]
Stan
[to Kyle] Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. [faces forward and continues walking]
End of Child Abduction is Not Funny

A Ladder to Heaven
South Park, city sidewalk, day. Stan, Cartman and Kyle head for a bright, colorful store called "Lolly's Candy Factory." Cartman carries three buckets: two on his back, supported by a crossbar, and a huge one on his head. The proprietor, Lolly, opens the door and sets a sign so it reads "OPEN," thus starting his business day. On his red apron is a large yellow lollipop with "LOLLY" printed over it. The boys stop and look.
Lolly
[notices the kids and straightens up] Oh, hello there, kids! Welcome to Lolly's Candy Shop.
Stan
We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
Lolly
Oh that's great!
Cartman
You bet your fat clown ass it is!
Lolly
Okay! Well I'll just need your ticket stub.
Cartman
[the boys' jaws drop a bit] ...ticket stub?
Lolly
You know. When you entered the contest you got the other half of this ticket. [display the store's half of the ticket]
Stan
Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
Kyle
It was such a long time ago!
Cartman
Wu-we don't really "need" the ticket stub, do we?
Lolly
Don't need the ticket stub?? Are you high?? How else do I know you're the winners?
Stan
Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
Lolly
Sh-orry boys. No ticket stub, no candy shopping spree. If you find it, you can come back, but you only have one week to claim the prize. That's called "The Ticking Clock." Works great in the movies. [steps backwards into the store and closes the door. The boys look at the door for a few seconds, then Cartman turns and steps forward]
Cartman
[drops the buckets] GODDAMMIT!!!
Stan
We've gotta find that ticket!
Kyle
Which one of us took it?! It was so long ago, I c- I can't remember.
Cartman
You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. [Zoom in on Cartman, who starts remembering...]
Lolly's Candy Factory, over a year ago. Kenny is still alive back then.
Lolly
[hands a ticket stub to Stan] All right. There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. You'll need it to claim your prize. [looks at the rest of the store] Sign up for the five-minute shopping spree!! [walks off]
Stan
[hands the stub to Cartman] You hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it.
Cartman
[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
Kyle
Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [hands the stub to Kenny]
Kenny
(Okay.) [takes it and pockets it]
Back to the present. The boys realize Kenny was the last to hold the stub as their mouths open.
Cartman
[bolts away] Kenny!!!
Stan, Kyle
[following quickly] AAAHHH!! [the buckets stay on the ground and the boys rush to Kenny's house]
Kenny's house, later. The boys arrive gasping for air and Kyle rings the doorbell.
Stuart
[opens the door] Yes?
Stan
Where's Kenny??
Stuart
Uh... boys... Kenny died ...last December. Don't you remember?
Kyle
We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
Carol
His body? Well, why??
Cartman
Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
Stan
[shuts Cartman up quick and stumbles for words] Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
Kyle
Yeah. Closure.
Cartman
[muffled] What the fuck is closure?!
Carol
Oh all right boys. Come on in. [the boys follow the McCormicks in]
Kenny's house, inside. The boys follow the parents through the house.
Stuart
We haven't seen you boys for so long, we thought you'd forgotten all about him.
Carol
Here he is, boys. Our dear little Kenny. [an urn is shown, with pictures of Kenny on either side of it.]
Cartman
You turned him into a teapot?
Stuart
No. That's an urn, boys. Kenny's inside it.
Carol
Your friends are here to see you, Kenny. [picks up the urn and caresses it.] They miss you an awful lot, like we all do. [starts crying]
Stuart
Thang-thanks for coming by, boys. Ih-ih, it means a lot to us. [turns to his wife and consoles her] Aw now, honey. [joins her in sobbing]
Kenny's house, nighttime, living room. A circle appears on a window and that piece of window is removed. Cartman sets the circle down and looks around. He reaches up to open the window latch, then opens the window door. He slips in and goes for the urn. He pulls out a fake detector and moves it around.
Cartman
Wewewewewewe...
Stan
[climbs up to the window and looks in] Did you get it? [Kyle climbs up next to him]
Cartman
Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards. [resumes the detection] Wewewewewewe...
Kyle
There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! [Cartman looks back at the boys angrily, gets Kenny's urn, and climbs back out the window. Seconds later, a robot guard does indeed move through the living room...]
Robot Guard
Wewewewewewe...
Cartman's house, night, kitchen. The boys rush to the counter and climb up on the stools.
Kyle
Alright, we made it!
Stan
Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
Kyle
Let him out, Cartman! [Cartman opens the urn and the boys duck]
Cartman
...Kenny? [the boys lose their fear and rise up to look at the urn] Kenny?!
Kyle
Is he in there?
Stan
I can't see. [Cartman pours out the ashes and the boys sneeze from the fine powder until it dissipates. Some ash smudges remain on their faces.]
Cartman
What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
Kyle
I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! [Cartman samples the ashes]
Stan
It was a trick!
Cartman
God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
Stan
Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
Kyle
Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
Cartman
Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
Stan
We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! [gets off his stool and walks away.]
Kyle
Goddamnit! There has to be a way! [leaves his stool and follows Stan out. Cartman looks at the ashes, then thinks of something]
Cartman
Hmmm. [leaves his stool and returns with some milk, a glass, and a spoon. He scoops up some ashes and drops them into the glass. He pours the milk onto the ashes, stirs them up, and drinks the milk ] Hmm, not bad. [scoops some more ashes into the milk]
Cartman's room, night. The empty glass sits on his nightstand. The camera zooms out to show Cartman sleeping with Clyde Frog. Cartman tosses in his bed and his dream appears. A circle appears. Outside of the circle is a lining to a jacket. Inside is someone's point of view. The surroundings seen in that circle indicates that this is Kenny's point of view. Kenny seems to be walking around in his own room. Kenny's arm appears and opens the door, and Kenny's mom appears at the end of the hall.
Carol
Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! [the dream ends abruptly]
Cartman
[sits up, eyes wide open] Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. [growls a bit, turns to sleep, and farts. The door flies open and Stan and Kyle rush in]
Stan
Cartman, come on!
Cartman
[sits up again] What what? [sees who it is] Jesus, you buttholes! It's six in the morning!
Stan
Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
Cartman
How?
Kyle
A ladder to heaven. [unfolds some blueprints] We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
Stan's house, day. The blueprints are in place on an easel. The design is a slender tower rising some 120 feet into the sky. The camera pulls back to show the boys hammering boards into place. Stan's parents step outside to see the construction.
Randy
Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.
Stan
[going for some more wood] We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
Randy
A ladder to heaven? Why, son?
Stan
Because we wanna see Kenny again. [heaves a piece of wood back to the tower]
Sharon
[after a moment of though] Oh... oh, that's so sweet.
Randy
That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.
Jimbo
[approaching] Hey Randy, can I borrow your uh... [sees the boys' activity] What the hell are they doing?
Randy
The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.
Jimbo
Awwww.
Sheila
[arriving with Gerald] Kyle, I think you've bothered the Marshes enough.
Randy
No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.
Gerald
A ladder tuh... Oh... oh God. [begins to sob]
Sheila
Oh, that's so touching. [begins to sob. All the adults begin to cry. The boys continue building]
Behind Stan's house, day. A reporter has arrived and now begins his report.
Field Reporter
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where last December, eight-year-old Kenny McCormick died of a terminal illness. But now, that little boy's three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven, in order to- [chokes as the camera reaches the tower, then gathers himself] a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again. [sighs] It's so sad and yet so beautiful, Tom. Here's what some people had to say.
Randy
Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work... [begins to break down] if he... built the ladder to heaven.
Sheila
[sobbing] They just believe in their little hearts that it will work. We can't tell them it won't, we just can't!
Jimbo
[wistful] It shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is. [starts sobbing. Other people are show crying: Marietta Kitchin, Carrie Ayers & Steve Stegman]
Mr. Garrison
A ladder to heaven? That's fuckin' stupid.
Mayor McDaniels
[sobbing with her aides] These boys symbolize how we all feel about loss. Who are we to tell them it's impossible?
Field Reporter
Tom, people from all over the- [chokes] Sorry. [gets back on track] People from all over the country are coming to see the ladder, feeling a connection to its symbolism, and beauty. Even country singer Alan Jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder. [camera pulls back to show Jackson to the reporter's left, strumming a guitar] Alan Jackson is, of course, the man who wrote the song, "Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning," about the tragedies on September 11. And now he's here once again to capitalize on people's emotions. Let's listen in. [focus shifts to Jackson]
Alan Jackson
Where were you when they built the ladder to heaven?
Did it make you feel like cryin', or did you think it was kind of gay?

Townsman
What a beautiful song. [the boys look down at Jackson]
Alan Jackson
Well I, for one, believe in the ladder to heaven.
Oh yeah yeah yeah. 9-11
[the townsfolk begin to cry]
I said 9-11, 9-11, 9-11, Ni-hi, hi-hine___
Eleven.

Thank you! I have a new CD out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here! [the crowd rushes in to get copies of the CD. Jackson is pleased at the interest. The boys resume their construction. Stan and Kyle are hammering away at the top of the ladder. Cartman hustles up the ladder with a car seat]

Kyle
Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
Cartman
I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. [hands it to the other two boys, who put it in place]
Stan
Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
Cartman
...No. [the boys let the seat drop] Ey! Euuugh.
Flashback #2 - resumes where the first one left off. Kenny seems to be walking around in his own room. Kenny's arm appears and opens the door, and Kenny's mom appears at the end of the hall.
Carol
Hurry up, Kenny! You're gonna be late for school! [the dream ends abruptly]
Stuart
Kenny, do you by any chance know what happened to my Playboys? [shows Kenny a centerfold, which shows a circle where the centerfold's crotch should be. He lifts the centerfold high enough to look through the hole] Kenny?! Answer me!! [back to the present - Cartman looks dazed]
Kyle
Cartman? Cartman?!
Cartman
[startled] Wha-uh, what?? What?
Kyle
Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!
Cartman
I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
Kyle
Maybe you got brain cancer.
Cartman
Do you think?
Stan
Don't get cancer on the ladder, Cartman! You're gonna fall off and break it!
SNN newscast. Graphics are shown indicating 74% of Americans believe in the ladder.
SNN Reporter
The nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in Colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend. [a picture of the boys on the ladder is shown] It's making Americans start to believe in heaven, again. [next segment has the reporter out on the street]
Woman 1
Well when I see how this ladder has brought people together, how... how it has changed America, I mean, how can I not believe?
SNN Reporter
[off screen] Ha do YOU actually believe in the ladder to heaven?
Fat Man
If... heaven is an eight-year-old boy, and the ladder is my penis... [the camera moves away quickly, but the man keeps up] and the pearly gates are the- [static... the camera pulls back to show the reporter back at the desk, holding a TV status pattern on paper and hissing. He notices the camera and stops, putting the pattern down]
SNN Reporter
Uh, meanwhile, the American economy cont- [gets some breaking news over his headset] wait. Wait. Wait a minute. We are getting reports now that Japan is building their own ladder to heaven to compete with the US's. Let's go live to SNN correspondent Nobuhiro Sabasurisurijuwa.
SNN Correspondent
This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from Tokyo, where Japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben. [the tower is shown with klieg lights bathing it in light] Ahready, the Japanese radder extend faaar into space [the ladder is now high enough for a space shuttle to park by and astronauts come out to work on it] and it's growing by a-one thousand miles every day. [back on the ground...] As the endeavor continues it is becoming clear that Japan will reach a-hayben before the United States. [a raspberry follows]
South Park, just past sunset. The neighbors have gathered around the ladder in Stan's back yard and are now singing.
Neighbors
Nahurabo Nahurabo
Stan
Excuse me. ["Nahurabo"] Excuse me! ["Nahurabo"] Uh, we ran out of stuff. [the singing abruptly stops] We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
Man 1
Oh no!
Woman 2
Oh Jesus, no!
Alan Jackson
Where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven?
Stan
We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
Randy
[raises his arms high] No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.
Gerald
Yeah... Ih it's time we told the boys the truth, that they aren't really going to get to heaven. [a truck is heard arriving]
Man 2
[at the back, by the fence] Wait! Look! [a fleet of trucks, cars, and jeeps converge on the road outside the house]
General
We've come to help you beat those Japs, boys! [behind him, military personnel bring out ladders and other construction equipment] There won't be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today! [the crowd cheers wildly. The boys' parents are dumbstruck] Alpha Team! Get that support structure up! Ciranom's Team! Get us photos and recon! [the teams set about their duties]
Soldiers
Yes sir!
Alan Jackson
Where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven?
Kyle
[with Cartman at the top of the ladder] Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
Cartman
Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
South Park, next day. The boys resume building the ladder, and they almost break through the cloud above them. Stan is the first to peer over the clouds. Kyle soon joins him.
Kyle
Do you see anything?
Stan
No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
Kyle
Grandma??
Cartman
[joins the other two boys, grunting as he gets into position] Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
Stan
No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
Cartman
Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
Kyle
Huh?
Cartman
Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
Stan
What??
Cartman
You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
Kyle
[processes the comment] What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
Cartman
Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
Kyle
Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
Cartman
Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
Kyle
HAAHH!!! [smacks Cartman on the side of the face with his left fist]
Cartman
AH! [stunned, he has another flashback. A heartbeat is heard]
Flashback #2 - Kenny arrives at the bus stop.
Kyle
Hey Kenny.
Stan
Hey Kenny.
Kenny
(We can watch it at my house.)
Cartman
In the ghetto, in the ghetto. He's a boy wearing orange, who's losing his pride, 'cause Kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto, in the ghetto
Kenny
[points an accusing finger at Cartman] (Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
Cartman
What did you say?!
Kenny
(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
Cartman
What did you say?!
Cartman
[in the present] I said "Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!" [opens his eyes and looks around] Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?
Stan
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you??
Cartman
I dunno, I just, I keep feeling like I'm Kenny. Seeing memories through his eyes.
Kyle
You're too fat to be Kenny.
Cartman
[amid his thoughts] You're a- stupid Jew.
Stan
Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
The White House, Washington D.C., moments later. George Bush arrives at the Oval Office and takes his seat at the executive desk.
Bush
Alright, how's the ladder going, General? Are we beating the Japanese?
General
Not quite, but we have a new problem, Mr. President. Our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats... from Saddam Hussein.
Bush
Saddam Hussein? But... we killed him! We secretly took him out months ago!
General
Yes sir. And now we believe he's building weapons of mass destruction... in heaven.
Bush
Dear Christ, that sonofabitch just doesn't stop!
General
[flips a page on an easel, showing another page with three identical photos] These surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven. [points out an encircled object in the center photo] Here we see what we believe to be a missile silo. And here [points out an encircled object in the lower photo] we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons.
Dick Cheney
That... kinda looks like a seagull.
General
Yes. It could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull.
Bush
That tricky bastard!
General
Sir, you must understand our fears. We must take out those facilities. We must... [close-up] bomb heaven!
SNN newsroom, new poll.
SNN Reporter
SNN Question of the Day: Now that Americans believe in heaven, should we bomb it? The polls right now show that 51% of Americans think Saddam has to be dealt with, while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging pussies.
War Protester
[in tie-dye shirt, waving a "No War On Heaven" sign] War is not my voice! This country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns!
Redneck
[with baby dangling from the left hand, rifle firmly in the right hand] We have to take Saddam out to protect ourselves.
Fat Man
I, for one, believe that if Saddam Hussein were an eight-year-old boy, and my penis were the United States... [the mic is retracted] then there would- [the cameraman tries to avoid the man, but nope] hard nipples!
SNN Reporter
[back in the newsroom] God-damnit! [holds up the snow pattern and hisses]
News 4 field report.
Field Reporter
Tom, it's been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and capture the nation's hearts. They've made a nation believe heaven might be up there. And it could prove to be a threat to our country. President Bush will seek UN approval for military action.
The Marsh home, day. The boys' ladder is seen rising above the house, in the backyard. In the dining room, the boys' parents sit opposite the boys at the table.
Randy
Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...
Gerald
But it's time for you to get back to school and on with your lives.
Stan
No, we have to see Kenny!
Sharon
You have to understand that Kenny's body isn't up in the clouds. He was cremated.
Stan
Cremated? What's that?
Randy
When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. [the boys are alarmed]
Kyle
What?? For God's sake, why??
Sheila
[half-annoyed] Kyle, it's just what some people do.
Kyle
Are you gonna burn me?
Gerald
Kyle, that's not the issue right now.
Kyle
Jesus Christ!
Randy
The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.
Carol
You see boys, Kenny is in here. [opens the urn and pours out the contents, which are white now. Mrs. McCormick notices] What the??? [looks inside the urn] Wait a minute! This is kitty litter!
Cartman
[resigned, comes clean] Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
Stuart
You WHAT??
Stan
Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
Cartman
[knowingly] Shut up!
Kyle
You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
Cartman
[knowingly] Shut up!
Carol
Oh my God! This is awful! [starts moving away. The other adults follow] And disgusting!
Liane
[stops and looks at Cartman] Bad, Eric, bad! [moves away]
Cartman
That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
Stan
Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! [leaves the table]
Kyle
Yeah. Good job, fatass! [leaves the table]
Cartman
I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
Day, Unplanned Parenthood, a place where they remove living souls from a pregnant woman's body, if you believe fetuses have souls... Cartman speaks to the nurse, who is sitting behind a desk writing absentmindedly.
Cartman
Looks like I've come to the right place.
Nurse
Can I help you?
Cartman
Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that I need sucked out, please.
Nurse
You'll have to make an appointment; the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars.
Cartman
Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! [a woman and her boyfriend enter the clinic. The woman sobs]
Boyfriend
It's gonna be okay, babe.
Cartman
Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me! [the woman can't believe what she's hearing] I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
Woman
Oh Steven, I can't go through with this! I have to keep it! [walks away from the clinic]
Steven
Damnit! Damnit! [turns and walks off, then looks back in] Thanks a lot, kid! [throws a rock at Cartman]
Cartman
Eh! [becomes catatonic once more, and another flashback comes]
The scene is the sidewalk. Stan, Cartman and Kyle run up to Kenny.
Cartman
Kenny! Kenny! Kenny...
Stan
Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree! [the last few words echo a few times]
Kyle
We're all gonna pitch in on an entry! [the last few words echo a few times. Fast forward to the day the boys are at Lolly's]
Lolly
Alright! [rips a ticket in half and hands the stub to Stan] There you go. Hold on to that ticket stub. [the last few words echo a few times. He gives the ticket to Stan and walks off]
Stan
[hands the stub to Cartman] Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. [the last few words echo a few times]
Cartman
[takes it, then hands it to Kyle] Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle, of it, Kyle, of it Kyle...
Kyle
Okay. [takes it, then has second thoughts] N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. [the last word echoes a few times. He hands the stub to Kenny]
Kenny
(Okay!) [the word echoes a few times. He takes it and pockets it. Fast forward to some time later, on the sidewalk]
Cartman
You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts! [fast forward to Kenny's room. He walks to a locked box by the window while looking at the ticket stub. He unlocks it, puts the ticket in, and locks the box again.]
Back to the present. Cartman comes to and knows where to go.
Cartman
The ticket! Kenny didn't have it on him when he died! He put it away somewhere! [walks up to a couple filling out paperwork] Don't you see? I can still have my candy shopping spree! Oh my God! [heads out the door] You guys! YOU GUYS!!
The United Nations, day. In the main hall President Bush is speaking to the Assembly.
Bush
Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction. [shows a picture of the ladder and another one of the clouds. Both pictures have areas circled in] We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But he has not "re-spond-ed".
Indian Ambassador
Of course he has not responded, because he's DEAD!
Bush
Right. Dead, and in heaven.
Another Ambassador
This is preposterous! Even if there was a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein's soul would be sent there?
Bush
Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn't want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him around August. [the French Ambassador has tuned out] When Saddam became jealous and tried to kill Satan's new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent to heaven to live with Mormons as a punishment. [the assembly is overcome with silence] Questions? [more silence. An ambassador raises his hand] Yes?
Another Ambassador
Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?
Bush
I assure you, I am not high.
South Park, day. A tower has gone up around the ladder at the Marsh house. Helicopters and cranes hoist. On the ground Stan and Kyle sit on some lumber watching the military take over the construction. Cartman runs up to them.
Cartman
You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! [Stan and Kyle rise and line up on either side of Cartman]
Kyle
What do you mean, fatass?
Cartman
I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn't keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.
Stan
Where??
Cartman
I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic [Kyle looks down at the lumber, then looks at the pile behind him] and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box. [Kyle fishes around for a small solid piece of lumber, then finds one and aims it at Cartman's head] I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken- [thunk] AY! [is dazed for a bit, then recovers none too pleased, then glares at Kyle]
Kyle
Do you see anything?
Cartman
Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! [starts at Kyle, but Stan holds him back]
Stan
Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
Cartman
Not by giving me brain damage!
Stan
Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
Cartman
[stares at Stan, then resigns to his former position] Alright, go ahead. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!... no. [Kyle rears back and swings... thunk] AY!...
Near the back of the house. The neighbors are watching the construction. Sharon and Sheila arrive.
Sharon
Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven! The Japanese just reached it with their ladder!
Randy
What? [follows the ladies out with Gerald]
Living room, seconds later.
Sharon
See for yourself!
The SNN Japanese correspondent is on camera.
SNN Correspondent
This is a Nobunaga Hiroichi reporting rive from hayben. [behind him is a set with clouds hanging from wires. Angels swing into place slowly] The great a-nation of Japan reached a-hayben today about eight o'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh. [one of the angels falls off her rope and hits the ground. The correspondent sees this and moves in front of her to block the shot. Someone enters the shot and plants a Japanese flag among the clouds] Therefore, hayben is now a-decrared an official part of Japan, because we got a-here first. And now for the weather in heaben, let's go to Natsako Semu.
Natsako Semu
Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy.
Nobunaga
[fairly gloating] That's the news from heben. [the set creaks behind him and falls down, showing the studio.] Dame! Dame da! Bakayarou da!! ["No good! It's no good! Idiots!"]
Living room, seconds later.
Randy
Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.
Gerald
Kids!
Backyard. The crowd in and around the yard is immense now. George Bush and his staff are present.
Bush
Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we'll be ready to take Saddam out.
Sharon
Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?
Randy
If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. [behind the crowd Cartman, Stan and Kyle return with buckets of candy. That conking finally worked]
Stan
Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. [everyone turns to look at the boys]
Some Guy
Dude.
General
Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won't let us use theirs.
Kyle
Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
Randy
Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
Cartman
...I've never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.
Field Reporter
But... what about your lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?
Stan
Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
Kyle
Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
General
So, you're saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!
Johnson
Sir!
Randy
No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.
Crowd
Awwww. [the crowd begins to disperse and people begin to cry in appreciation]
Bush
[moving off with his staff] And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin' bombs.
Alan Jackson
Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea 'n you couldn't, you couldn't really get there? [walks up to the boys] You little bastards ruined my latest song! [drives his guitar into the snow, breaking it, then walks away]
Kyle
Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
Stan
Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
Cartman
[chuckles] No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick! [looks stunned] ...Oh Jesus Christ.
Kyle
Whoa. [shakes Cartman around] Kenny, you in there?
Cartman
Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! [runs off]
Stan
Dude, come back here! [chases after Cartman]
Kyle
Stop him, Kenny! [follows them off. The camera suddenly pans up]
Heaven. Weapons of mass destruction are seen among the clouds. Saddam is right there shouting directions.
Saddam Hussein
Keep those nitrogen capsules over there by the warheads! Right. Chop-chop. Come on!
God
[a bright beam of light lands on Saddam, who shields his eyes] Saddam. I've been hearing rumors that you're secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here.
Saddam Hussein
Weapons of mass destruction? Nooo! This is a chocolate chip factory. See? [displays boxes of "Saddam's Heavenly Chocolate Chips"]
God
It looks like a chemical weapons plant.
Saddam Hussein
Look, God, if I was gonna secretly build a chemical weapons plant, I wouldn't make it look like a chemical weapons plant, would I? I'd make it look like a chocolate chip factory or something.
God
...Alright, just checking. [removes the beam of light]
Saddam Hussein
[giggles] Stupid asshole! [goes back to work]
End of A Ladder to Heaven

The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers
Marsh residence, night. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman stand in the living room in costume.
Stan
O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
Cartman
Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
Kyle
That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
Randy
[entering] Uh, boys, [the boys look up] Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?
Stan
You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
Randy
Yeah, whatever.
Cartman
It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
Kyle
But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
Stan
[reaches out and receives the tape] Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
Ho! [they head out the front door. Randy moves away from the stairs and towards Sharon on the sofa]
Randy
[snuggles up to her] Hmmm, that gets rid of them.
Sharon
Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you?
Randy
Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store. [holds up a VHS case] I also rented... a porno.
Sharon
Oho, you little devil.
Randy
[softly, sensually] You wanna go watch?
Neighborhood streets. The boys are well into their quest.
Stan
How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
Kyle
[notices something and gasps] Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
Cartman
Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. [a car passes by and Cartman fires away at it with his staff]
Stan
Good job, wizard.
Cartman
And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew.
Kyle
I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
Cartman
Jews can't be Paladins.
Marsh residence; bedroom. Randy waxes his eyebrows with saliva getting ready for a night of porno. Sharon appears in a ruby lingerie, leans suggestively against the doorway of the master bathroom and runs her finger along the bedroom wall. Randy takes the porno to the TV.
Sharon
Hey there, cowboy.
Randy
[holds up the video and turns to Sharon] You ready for some hot, steamy fun?
Sharon
[smiling, right index finger against her chin] You bet I am.
Randy
The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, "this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made." [puts the video into the player]
Sharon
[now reclining on the bed, running her finger along the bedsheets] Mmm, sounds good.
Randy
I love that lingerie. [opens his nightgown to reveal a purple cod piece, then in a low voice] Yeah. You like that?
Sharon
Mm, yeah baby.
Randy
Yeeaahhh. [reclines on the bed, facing her and holding the remote control] Alright, you ready?
Sharon
Ready.
Randy
Oh, yeah. [they turn to the TV. Randy starts the video]
Narrator
[the video begins. Randy massages Sharon's arm] The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle-earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar.
Randy
Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.
Narrator
Seven rings were cast and given to the races of Men.
Randy
Oh yeah. [begins caressing Sharon]
Narrator
Seven, to the races of Elves, five to the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor. [Sharon takes a good look at the video]
Sharon
Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. [Randy takes a look]
Randy
Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the-- [jumps up and sits on the bed, aghast] Oh, my God! [quickly rises and turns off the TV, gets the video out, and reads] This is Lord of the Rings!
Sharon
But then that mean..?
Randy
The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
Stotch residence. The boys approach. Kyle knocks, Stephen and Linda open the front door.
Stephen
Oh, hello boys.
Stan
My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
Stephen
Well, thank you very much, kind heroes.
Cartman
Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
Stephen
Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. [closes the door. The boys leave]
Cartman
Man, that's crap.
Basement. Butters is drawing something on paper. His parents descend with video in hand.
Stephen
Butters, [Butters stands up] look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings.
Butters
[rushes up to meet his parents] Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
Linda
Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?
Butters
Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!
Stephen
That's our man. Here you go. [hands the tape to Butters, who goes to the VCR and puts the tape in. The parents leave]
Butters
Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. [the video begins to play. A man and a woman are heard]
Evan Stone
[softly] Spank that ass. [a few seconds later, a spanking is heard]
Butters
Whoa. [more sounds from the video] Neat-o. [more sounds, a few spankings] Well, this is good.
Marsh car. Randy drives, Sharon worries. They have donned pajamas and thrown on coats.
Sharon
Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. "Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back." [buries her face in her right hand]
Randy
Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
The woods. As Randy and Sharon head for Butters' house, the boys walk home through backwoods.
Cartman
And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
Stan
The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. [a few seconds later some headlights shine on them]
Kyle
Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
Cartman
Prepare for battle! [switch to the car]
Sharon
The boys! [Randy drives up to the boys and stops. Both he and Sharon jump out and rush up to them]
Randy
Boys! Boys! [stops] Where's the videotape?
Stan
We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
Sharon
Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now.
Randy
Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? [the boys look at each other]
Cartman
This sounds like a really important quest.
Randy
Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home. [falling into a fantasy accent] Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.
Stan
Woww.
Cartman
This... is so cool.
Kyle
[turns left] Gentlemen, we are off! [the boys turn back to walk to Butters' house. Randy watches them leave]
Randy
[rises and looks at Sharon] Okay, problem solved.
Stotch residence; basement, moments later. Butters is looking at more of the video. He has a surprised expression on his face. Steamy action is heard.
Woman
...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm...
Butters
Oh golly. [his legs part and he points to his crotch] Hey, what's happening down there? [the basement door is heard opening and closing. Butters is fascinated by his body's reaction. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come down the stairs. Butters reaches for his crotch for tactile inspection]
Stan
We have come to reclaim the one tape! [Butters sits up and Kyle goes for the tape]
Butters
[walks up to Kyle] Wha-wha, what are you doing?! [Kyle removes it and puts it into the LotR case it came in]
Kyle
[walks off. Butters is saddened] The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
Butters
But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it.
Cartman
Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. [the boys head up the stairs and out of the house. Butters opens the door and jumps at them]
Butters' house, outside.
Butters
Bwaagghh! [falls on his face, then quickly gets up and retreats]
Kyle
Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
Butters
Well, then... then let me go with you.
Kyle
Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. [Little does Kyle know what Butters' idea of LotR is. The boys turn to walk away]
Butters
Wuh, okay. [Butters jumps on Kyle's left arm and starts making love to it] Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
Kyle
[glares at Butters] Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
Butters
[a bit surprised] Playing Lord of the Rings. [resumes the love-making] Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
Kyle
[smacks Butters with the tape, causing him to fall off] Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
Butters
[on hands and knees, with renewed determination] Let me have the tape!
Stan
[takes the tape from Kyle] No, we have to return it! [the boys turn to walk away again. Butters crawls a few inches]
Butters
My movie! [sorrowfully reaches out for it with left hand] My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
The woods, night. The boys retrace their steps through the backwoods.
Cartman
And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
Kyle
This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite oddly.
Stan
Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too.
Cartman
Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. [three older boys ride up on their bikes and stop before the group. It's the sixth graders]
Sixth Grader 1
[gets off his bike and approaches the boys] Well, well, well! If it isn't Robin Hood and his Merry Men!
Kyle
Oh, crap, the sixth graders!
Sixth Grader 1
Whatcha got there?
Stan
Nothing. [the sixth grader rips the tape out of Stan's hand] Hey, kid!
Sixth Grader 1
[looks at the case] Lord of the Rings? Ha! That movie's gay!
Cartman
You're gay!
Sixth Grader 1
[opens the case and looks at the tape] What the--? [reads the title: "Back Door Sluts 9" XXX] Whoa! [backs up to show the tape to his friends] Check it out, you guys!
Sixth Graders 2 and 3
Whoa!
Stan
Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
Sixth Grader 1
[approaches menacingly with the tape. Stan backs up] No way! We're keepin' this and watchin' it ourselves!
Kyle
You can't keep it.
Sixth Grader 1
And what are three little fourth graders gonna do about it, huh?!
Stan
There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
Cartman
Yeah!
Sixth Grader 1
Oh man, I can't wait to see this!
Kyle
[aside to Stan] Dude, that video is making people act strange.
Cartman
The one tape must be returned! [swats the tape out of the sixth grader's hands with the staff and watches as the tape falls into Stan's hands] Run! [the boys run away from the sixth graders]
Sixth Grader 1
Get 'em! [his two friends ride off after the boys. He picks up his bike and joins his friends]
Stotch residence. Randy and Sharon have arrived, and Randy knocks on the door. Stephen answers the door again.
Stephen
Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon.
Randy
Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?
Linda
No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs.
Sharon
Oh, dear!
Stephen
What's the matter?
Randy
We... [now nervous] Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidentally put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. [Sharon shrugs, and both of them smile sheepishly]
Linda
Ohh God!! [the Stotches panic and rush downstairs. The Marshes follow]
Basement. Chris, Linda, Randy and Sharon enter. The TV is still on, but there's static. Butters isn't around.
Stephen
Butters?
Linda
Butters? [they notice the television] Butters!
Butters
[peeks out from behind the sofa, in the shadow, then speaks in a raspy voice] The precious? [his parents turn to see him] Could you bring back my precious?
Stephen
Butters, where is the movie you were watching?
Butters
[crawls out into view] They took his precious, took it away to watch without him. [sits up and puts his hands on his knees] He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
Randy
The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
Sharon
[gravely] Oh, no. [Stephen and Linda look back at them]
The woods, later. The camera moves from a clearing to a tree with a large root shading a pocket underneath. The boys come into view.
Kyle
We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
Cartman
I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
Sixth Grader 1
[nearby, off screen] I smell fourth graders!
Stan
Oh crap, dude!
Kyle
Hide! [they jump over the massive root and hide in the pocket underneath. The lead sixth grader comes into view and sniffs the air. He hops off and looks around over the root. The boys look up in apprehension. The sixth grader sniffs around above them]
Sixth Grader 2
[off screen] Hey. [the lead sixth grader whips around and goes to see who it is. It's his friend, in brown cap] I think I see something down the hill. [the lead sixth grader looks in that direction, then the sixth graders take off. The boys express relief after a few seconds]
Stan
Ogh. [Cartman sighs silently]
Kyle
Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
Stan
Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders.
Cartman
[rises and moves off] Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
Kyle
Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. [the boys leave the root]
Broflovski residence, night. The boys' parents are all gathered in the living room.
Randy
[debriefing Gerald and Sheila] And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
Sheila
Oh God, this, this is horrible!
Gerald
All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?
Randy
I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. [he and Sharon hang their heads in shame]
Gerald, Stephen
Backdoor Sluts 9?!?
Linda
Is that bad?
Stephen
Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!
Gerald
I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. [Sheila gets angrier by the word]
Sheila
[slaps him] How the hell do you know?!
Gerald
[shakily] I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People.
Sheila
[now facing the Marshes] Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!
Sharon
We're sorry.
Liane
Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film.
Sheila
Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
Randy
It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
Butters
[pops up outside and taps on a window] Precious. [the adults turn to see the window] Let me see my precious. [slides down the window and out of view] Plee-ee-ee-ease! [the adults just look on]
Stan, Kyle and Cartman arrive at a house. Stan rings the doorbell twice, but no answer.
Cartman
[waves his left hand around] Open. [nothing. He waves his left hand again] Bellog. [the door opens and Clyde appears]
Clyde
What do you guys want?
Stan
We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
Clyde
Oh. Okay, hang on a second. [steps back and closes the door, then reopens the door. He is now dressed as an elf. His staff is a small hoe] What troubles you?
Kyle
We have in our possession something of great power. [pulls out the videotape] It is... The Lord of the Rings.
Clyde
So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
Stan
Yes, but this is not a-- [stops, then reacts] Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. [hands the tape to Clyde]
Cartman
We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
Clyde
Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble.
Cartman
Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
Clyde
Faragon, asshole! [closes the door. The boys leave the house and walk off]
Cartman
Clyde's a dick.
A parking lot in town. A bunch of kids are gathered there on their bikes. The lead sixth graders hops onto a car and gets the others' attention.
Sixth Grader 1
Alright, everybody listen up! There's three snot-nosed little fourth graders out there who have a porno called Backdoor Sluts 9.
Other Sixth Graders
Ooooooh!
Sixth Grader 1
I checked it out on the Internet, and it said that Backdoor Sluts 9 is the most hard-core porno ever made.
Other Sixth Graders
Ahhhhh!
Sixth Grader 1
I have amassed this army of sixth graders to get the tape by any means necessary. Now, let's go get that porno! [the sixth graders scream and charge out into the night on their bikes]
Token's mansion, backyard. Very leafy backyard indeed. The camera moves from a shot of the moon to a shot of all the fourth grade boys seated around a small table.
Clyde
And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? [Kyle gets up, walks to the table, and stands the tape on it]
Other Boys
Ahhh.
Jimmy
That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
Craig
It could hold a mental spell of some kind.
Kevin
[wearing a Star Wars Imperial stormtrooper helmet] Perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers. [the kids look at him. One shot has Tweek wearing a large coffee tin on his head, Pip dressed as an elf, a kindergartner wearing a Fett helmet, then one of Stan, Kyle and Cartman]
Cartman
Kevin, god-damnit..! [Kevin looks around, then hops off his chair and leaves]
Clyde
Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody.
Stan
But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
Clyde
That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black.
Token
[thinks about this, then leaves his seat] I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape, [reaches the table and gets the tape] just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me. [walks towards the house] The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. [reaches the sliding door and enters the house, closing the door behnd him]
The neighborhood. The sixth graders come into view on their bicycles making all sorts of noise.
Sixth Grader 1
Fourth graders! Give us that porn-o! [they go out of view. A moment later the Marsh car comes into view]
Sharon
Boys? [the Broflovskis are in the back seat]
Sheila
[with her head out the window] Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. [behind them is the Stotch car]
Token's mansion, backyard. The boys wait for Token's verdict.
Cartman
Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. [the other boys stir]
Clyde
What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? [Token returns to the table and places the tape there]
Token
I'm not playing anymore. [walks off]
Stan
[steps forward] Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?
Token
[stops and turns] I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. [claps his hands, then walks back into the house, sliding the door open and closed. The boys look on]
Cartman
My God, this thing must really be powerful. [the boys turn to look at the tape]
Kyle
This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
Stan
What do we do with it?
Clyde
One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. It must be returned to the video store from whence it came.
Jimmy
Well, where is the videotape rented from?
Kyle
[picks up the tape and looks for the store name] Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
Tweek
Conifer? Walking there would take hours!
Craig
There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
Kindergartner
I'll go.
Craig
Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. [all the boys begin to chatter, nominating who should return the video]
Craig
You're too young.
Cartman
Quiet!
Jimmy
You guys, this is stupid.
Cartman
You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
Stan
I will take it! [the boys quiet down and Stan approaches the table. He takes the tape in hand. Cartman closes his eyes in meditation] I will walk to the video store.
Clyde
It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard [Cartman], the dwarf [the kindergartner], the warrior [Craig], the cleric [Jimmy], and the Jew [Kyle].
Kyle
[flashes anger] Paladin!
Clyde
Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
Tweek
Me too.
Other Boys
[agreeing] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Craig
Only the six of us are to go?
Stan
No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
Cartman
Yeah, stupid. [higher pitch] Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's big enough for the both of us. [a bit lower] Shut up, Kenny.
Kenosha Pass, snowing. The boys walk along the highway through the pass.
Narrator
So it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
Kyle
We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
Craig
Look out! [a small avalanche of snow appears in front of them]
Kyle
[gasps a little] We were almost killed.
Cartman
A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
Stan
True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
Token's mansion. The boys' parents are at the front door. The front door opens and Token's parents appear.
Token's Father
Oh. Hello everybody.
Gerald
Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago.
Token's Mother
Well yes, I believe they were, but they've gone. What's the matter?
Randy
We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.
Steve
What? But Token's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what to—Oh God! [rushes to look for Token]
Token's Mother
Token! [the other parents rush in]
The dining room table. Token sits alone on one of the many seats there. The adults arrive.
Token's Mother
Token? Did the boys come over and... show you a movie? [no answer]
Steve
Token? [no answer, long pause] Alright, Token. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. [no response, long pause]
Randy
[kneels next to Token] Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse. [no response, long pause] Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love.
Token
[no response, long pause] ...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too? [no response] Five midgets, spanking a man... covered with Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?
Steve
Jesus, what kind of porno is that?
Gerald
It was Backdoor Sluts 9.
Steve
Oh, Jesus, not that one! [his wife gives him an angry look]
Sheila
Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid.
Gerald
Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?
Bailey, town limit. The boys arrive there.
Craig
We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.
Stan
Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
Kindergartner
Ringworms are no match for a dwarf.
Cartman
Yes, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure! [they pass a yard on which some kids are playing] For that is the way of the--
Boy 1
I shall put a magic spell on you!
Boy 2
I have blocked your spell, wizard!
Kyle
Hey, what are you guys doing? [the Bailey kids turn and look]
Boy 3
We're playing Harry Potter.
Cartman
[after a few moments of thought] Ha!! Fags! [the boys move on. They soon pass a Country Café]
Kyle
[suddenly wary] You guys. Somebody is following us.
Cartman
It's Butters.
Kyle
Butters?
Cartman
Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. [behind the six boys, at some distance, is Butters, skulking along in the shadows]
Butters
The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
Cartman
Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
Jimmy
Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?
Cartman
There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! [the sound of sixth graders is heard in the distance. The boys look around to find the direction of the sound. The sixth graders appear in the horizon behind them and ride in quickly, screaming all the while]
Jimmy
They are coming. [a shot of the sixth graders] You guys go on ahead.
Kyle
Jimmy, are you sure?
Jimmy
Go! [the other five boys take off, leaving Jimmy to face the sixth graders alone. He turns and stares down the approaching throng] You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh... [the sixth graders draw closer] You shall not paah... [a shot of the young bikers, then a distance shot of Jimmy, then a shot of the young bikers, a shot of Jimmy, a shot of the young bikers, a quick shot of Jimmy, then the sixth graders as they reach Jimmy] You shall not pa--! [the sixth graders take shots at him as they pass by. He falls and gets up] You shall not paah--! [struck down again, rises, is struck down, rises...] You shall not puh-uh-uh-- [falls again. The last of the sixth graders passes by, and Jimmy stands up, all beat up, with tire tracks and bruises on his face and a black eye] You shall not pass. [falls down]
A river, further along the quest. Stan looks back to see about Jimmy.
Stan
Jimmy didn't stop them!
Kyle
They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
Cartman
Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
Craig
What? That's stupid.
Cartman
I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
Craig
Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids. [walks off]
Kindergartner
Me too. [follows Craig]
Cartman
Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
Stan
Just get across the river! They're coming! [the three remaining boys scramble across the river. The sixth graders arrive. Two of them stop their tires by performing wheelies and landing their bikes back on the road. The lead sixth grader rides up between them]
Sixth Grader 1
What the hell is wrong with you guys?! Get the tape!
Sixth Grader 4
Dude, I don't wanna get wet.
Sixth Grader 5
Yeah, I don't really like the water.
Sixth Grader 2
Besides, if our bikes get wet, their chains'll rust.
Sixth Grader 1
Oh, god-damnit. Alright, come on. We'll find a bridge. [the bikers ride off]
The woods, later. The boys walk through it.
Narrator
The quest continued to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
Stan
Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
Kyle
Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost.
Cartman
We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are! [twitched] That's what "lost" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!
Stan
This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
Butters
[crawls up to them] The Butters knowses.
Kyle
Oh brother!
Butters
The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
Stan
Where?!
Butters
First, just let Butters sseee the precious.
Kyle
No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
Cartman
If that was possible.
Stan
Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
Butters
[puts up his arms to shield himself] Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters. [squats with his arms hanging over his knees] We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. [walks forward in a squatting manner]
The road. Randy, Sharon, Gerald and Sheila ride in the Marsh car, with Randy driving, and Stephen drives the Stotch car.
Sheila
This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!
Gerald
Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context.
Sharon
Look! There's one of the boys now! [before them is Jimmy, fallen and asleep in the middle of the road. Randy steps on the brakes] Jimmy!
Randy
[the adults jump out of their cars and approach him] Jimmy! Jimmy! [Jimmy awakens and looks up] Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
Jimmy
They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii...
Stephen
Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time.
Jimmy
They took it back to the video s... the video s...
Randy
The video sandwich?
Stephen
The video stockyard.
Randy
What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?
Jimmy
No, the video suh... the video s...tih...
Gerald
Stinger?
Stephen
Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?
Jimmy
N-n-no, you retards! The video s...tore!
Adults
The video store! [they go to their cars]
Sheila
Hurry! Hurry!
Randy
I know where it is! [they get in their cars and peel off. ("When did the Broflovski station wagon arrive?") Jimmy is left where he was when they arrived]
Two Towers video store. The boys arrive out of breath and head for the front door.
Kyle
Oh no! They're closed!
Stan
Closed?
Sixth Grader 1
[off screen] There they are!
Sixth Grader 6
[the throng of sixth graders approach] Don't let them turn it back into the video store!
Cartman
We're screwed.
Stan
[seeing a way out of this mess] Wait. A drop box. [goes to it and pulls down the door] Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
Kyle
Finally. [he and Cartman move towards the box. Butters looks on] It's over.
Butters
[now moving] Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! [jumps on Kyle and runs off with the tape]
Kyle
Butters! No!
Butters
[now in the middle of the parking lot] Now wees hases it! [the sixth graders close in]
Stan
They're coming!
Kyle
[goes after Butters and tries to wrest the tape from him] It has to go back!
Butters
It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
Sixth Grader 1
[a foot away] There it is! Give me that tape! [Butters holds on tight to the tape, smiling wide.]
Kyle
[picks Butters up and carries him off] Let go of the tape, Butters!
Butters
I'll never let go! [Stan opens the drop box and holds the door open]
Kyle
Fine! [tosses him into the drop box]
Butters
Precious! [Stan closes the door. The lead sixth grader leaps off his bike and rushes to the drop box]
Sixth Grader 1
Nooo! [reaches in and fishes around for it] No, nooo! [walks off in disgust and hits the window] Damnit! [the other sixth graders arrive]
Sixth Grader 2
Aw man, now we'll never see the hot action.
Sixth Grader 1
You stupid little fourth graders!
Cartman
The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
Kyle
Middle-earth is again safe.
Sixth Grader 1
Yeah? Well, that's not gonna stop us from kicking your asses!
Stan
Uh-oh.
The lead sixth grader approaches punching his left fist into his right hand. The other sixth graders move in alowly. Headlights appear and a car horn sounds. The sixth graders look at the cars, as do the boys. The cars pull to a stop short of the boys.
Randy
Boys! Boys!
Sixth Grader 1
Crap! Parents! [gets on his bike and turns away] Come on, guys. [the sixth graders leave] We'll see you next time, fourthies!
Cartman
And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
Randy
There you are!
Sheila
Oh, Kyle! You're safe!
Stan
Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
Randy
A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths. [the boys are stunned] Uh, this is called "69ing" and it's normal.
Sharon
See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it.
Sheila
That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle.
Gerald
Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice.
Randy
That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
Sheila
It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.
Randy
Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.
Gerald
Okay, boys. Do you have any questions? [the boys are still stunned, but one of them finally speaks]
Stan
...Wow. [another long moment of stunned silence]
Randy
Well, let's all get going.
Sheila
Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. [the adults head for their cars, but the boys stay frozen in place]
Stephen
[turns around. Linda does as well] Wait a minute. Where's Butters?
Two Towers video store, inside the bin behind the drop box.
Butters
[rises from the batch of videotapes that buried him] Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
End of The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers

The Death Camp of Tolerance
Principal Victoria's office, day. Her door opens.
Mr. Garrison
[enters with Mr. Hat on his hand] You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
Principal Victoria
Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat. [Mr. Garrison takes a seat] Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade.
Mr. Garrison
[flatly] I'm aware of that.
Principal Victoria
I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you.
Mr. Garrison
Wow, that's... really great to hear.
Principal Victoria
As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job.
Mr. Garrison
[brightens] Oh, for real? You're not kidding?
Principal Victoria
We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that.
Mr. Garrison
[rises from the chair with excitement] Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true! [shakes her hand] Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!
Principal Victoria
I know you will. [Garrison turns around and walks away smiling]
Mr. Garrison
[turns around] You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow.
Principal Victoria
[slight chuckle] It's for real, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
[slight chuckle, turns around and walks out the door] Oh-ho, great!
Principal Victoria
With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.
Mr. Garrison
Right uh- [stops in his tracks at the door's entrance, his smile turns to wonder. He turns around] Wha- ...what was that?
Principal Victoria
Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money.
Mr. Garrison
...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?
Principal Victoria
[busy doing paperwork] Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.
Mr. Garrison
Yeh-you don't say. [strokes his chin] Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria. [walks out and closes the door] Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay!
South Park Elementary.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik. [the kids erupt in laughter]
Kyle
Funny.
Mr. Mackey
BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison. [the door opens and Garrison enters]
Kids
AWWWW!!!
Kyle
Not him!
Mr. Garrison
Thank you, Mr. Mackey.
Mr. Mackey
[walks toward the door] Good luck, m'kay.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is [writes on the board] Mr. Garrison.
Butters
Where is Mr. Hat, sir?
Mr. Garrison
Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat.
Kyle
[rolls his eyes] Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
Mr. Garrison
But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to... [the door opens again] Mr. Slave. [a strapping man enters. He wears a pink shirt, pale blue jeans; black leather vest, chaps and boots; police hat, strong jaw and mustache, and pouty lips]
Mr. Slave
[preens] Hi kids. Hm.
Mr. Garrison
So that's [writes on the board] Mr. Slave. [Mr. Slave poses] The teacher's assistant. [Mr Slave smooths his mustache, then his hat] Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass.
Mr. Slave
[throws his arms forward] Oh Jesus Christ.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. [Mr. Slave goes to sit down. Garrison spanks him as he passes by]
Mr. Slave
Ugh.
Cartman
[leans towards Craig, who pays attention] Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a... [glances back] Pakistani.
Mr. Garrison
I'm not saying the rest of the school year is going to be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard. [does motions for both words - the palms facing each other and pulling apart, then two fists] Really long and really hard. [emphasizes the motions]
Mr. Slave
[at a small teacher's desk reading a magazine] Oh Jesus Christ.
Mr. Garrison
[gleefully] Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. [erases the name on the board and begins writing the topic, starting with an S]
Cartman
[begins making a paper plane involuntarily] No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?
Mr. Garrison
[finishes writing "STALIN"] Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...
Cartman
[finishes the plane and aims it at Mr. Garrison] Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! [fires the plane off. It hits the board and falls away]
Mr. Garrison
[turns around and points] Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!
Cartman
No, it was Kenny!
Mr. Garrison
[arms akimbo] Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!
Stan
[coming to Cartman's defense] Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
The Other Kids
Yeah.
Mr. Garrison
That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment! [reaches into his desk and pulls out a paddle, then strikes it against his left palm twice. He walks over to Mr. Slave and has him bend over] Take it Mr. Slave! [swats him three times on the ass]
Mr. Slave
[moves his head around] Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.
Mr. Garrison
I will [swat] NOT put up with [swat] TOM foolery in my [swat] CLASS room, children. [stands him up and straps a gag ball around Mr. Slave's face] Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth. [bends Mr. Slave over his lap and swats him some more] Take that, Slavey! take it! [the kids look on, stunned. Mr. Garrison continues the swats] This'll get me fired for sure. [smiles]
The Marsh house, afternoon. The Tweaks, the Stotches, the Marshes, the Broflovskis, and Liane are present in the living room, seated around the coffee table.
Gerald
I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
Linda
Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America.
Randy
Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. [Sharon sips some coffee, a door opens]
Gerald
So full of metaphor.
Kyle
Hey guys, can we talk to you? [with him are Stan, Cartman, Butters, and Tweek]
Sheila
Oh, hi boys.
Sharon
How was school?
Kyle
Uhh, not cool.
Sheila
That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?
Linda
Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? [a burst of chatter follows]
Stan
No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
Stephen
Uh huh.
Kyle
Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
Sheila
Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
Stan
Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.
Randy
[displeased] Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for who they were.
Stan
Yeah, but Dad-
Randy
No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!
Sheila
That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! [Gerald crosses his arms. The kids look at each other]
Museum of Tolerance, next day. A really modern building with a fountain by the entrance. The five boys and their parents arrive at the museum.
Tour Guide
[a woman greeting the families inside the museum] Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in America. [Cartman yawns loudly. Liane smacks him across the back of his head]
Cartman
Ey!
Tour Guide
[leads them through the museum] Now, did you know that words we use can show intolerance? [leads the group to a tunnel entrance] Let's begin our tour with a walk through our Tunnel of Prejudice, to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against. [motions for the boys to enter, and the boys enter]
Voice
[the words it says appear on the walls of the tunnel as it says them, then disappear] QUEER. BEANER. CHINK. NIGGER. HEEB. FAGGOT. CRACKER. SLOPE. [the boys are suitably shocked as they move along the tunnel's people mover, but Cartman is grinning from ear to ear]
Cartman
Aw man, this is awesome! ["JAP"]
Tour Guide
[at the other end of the tunnel with the parents] Now you know how it feels.
Cartman
[excited, runs up to the guide] I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!
Tour Guide
[leads them into the Hall of Stereotypes] We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities. [leads them to the first exhibit] Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here? [the stereotypes are exhibits, each one with its own spotlight]
Randy
[walks up to another exhibit with Stan and Kyle] Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. [the Arab is holding a Kalashnikov rifle]
Tour Guide
That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids?
Butters
[sees a third exhibit] W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. [walks over to it. The others follow]
Tour Guide
That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like "All Asians are good at math" is harmful to society.
Cartman
[over at a fourth exhibit, a man cowering over a bag of money] Look, a covetous Jew!
Tour Guide
[arrives with the others] Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed.
Randy
[notices a fifth spotlight and walks to it] Ah, here's a good one. [Stan walks up next to him] It's the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." [a man sleeps under the spotlight sitting up next to a mop and bucket]
Janitor
[wakes up] Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it? [stands up and rubs the back of his neck]
Randy
[in a low voice] Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
Janitor
Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy. [walks off with the mop and bucket]
Tour Guide
[leads them into the Tolerance Discovery Lab] This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays [they measure tolerance I.Q.], because you see, being tolerant you must also learn to respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight, [moves her arms towards Cartman] like this young man here.
Cartman
Ey!
Tour Guide
You other boys have probably called this young man names like "tubby," or "lardbutt," or "fat tits,"...
Kyle
"Fat tits." That's a good one.
Stan
Yeah, I have to remember that.
Tour Guide
But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice.
Cartman
[strokes his chin and tries something out] I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.
Tour Guide
And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.
Cartman
Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! [the adults chuckle]
Randy
That's our Cartman. [Cartman grins]
Museum of Tolerance, outside.
Tour Guide
Well, that's the end of our tour.
Randy
Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
Stan
I guess.
Tour Guide
We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do. [notices someone nearby] Hey! What the hell are you doing? [it's a man smoking on the edge of the fountain]
Smoker
Oh I was just uh-
Tour Guide
There's no smoking in the museum!
Smoker
But I'm not in the museum.
Tour Guide
Get out of here, you filthy smoker! [the smoker rises and walks off]
Gerald
Yeah, dirty lungs!
Sharon
Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!
Stephen
Dumbass!
Richard
Get out of here! [the smoker walks out of view]
Tour Guide
Well, have a great day, everybody.
Stephen
Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?
The Boys
Yeah.
South Park Elementary, day, Garrison's class. Mr. Garrison enters, having previously set up a chemistry experiment on the teacher's desk.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today. [sits on a corner of the desk] Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?
Butters
It evaporates.
Mr. Garrison
Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react. [takes the tube in hand and walks over to Mr. Slave] Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please. [Mr. Slave looks up from his magazine, then assumes the position over his little desk and lowers his pants enough to show his ass] Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass. [steps backwards and inserts the tube. Mr. Slave starts to moan] The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy.
Mr. Slave
AAH.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?
Butters
Sure. [smiles and goes to get Lemmiwinks]
Stan
[sensing what's about to happen] Oh, no, no, no no no no.
Mr. Garrison
[gets Lemmiwinks from Butters] Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass? [the kids are all aghast] Well let's see. [lifts up the Bunsen tube and sends the gerbil on its way down]
Mr. Slave
AAH. [the gerbil enters Mr. Slave's lower intestine and comes across the skeleton of another gerbil. It turns back immediately and runs for the anal opening. Mr. Garrison pulls the tube out and the sphincter snaps shut, trapping the gerbil inside. It tries to claw its way out] AAH. [moves his head around] Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!
Butters
[realizing what just happened] Lemmiwinks? NO!
South Park Elementary, lunch time. The kids go for their lunches.
Chef
Hello there, children!
The Boys
Hey Chef.
Chef
How's it goin'?
Kyle
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Stan
Chef, we're intolerant. [beat]
Chef
...Intolerant of who?
Kyle
Gays, I guess.
Chef
Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children? [arms akimbo] I thought you knew better.
Stan
Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around them.
Chef
Children, a lot of times the reason people get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"
Kyle
Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
Chef
Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!
Stan
Are we homophobes now?
Kyle
We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.
Chef
Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??
Stan
N-no?
Chef
You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
Cartman
I'll take three lunches today, please.
Chef
You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!
Cartman
It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. [Chef is puzzled]
Fourth Grade classroom. The chemistry equipment has been cleared away from the teacher's desk. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave are in the classroom.
Mr. Garrison
That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave. [laughs] Now we'll get fired for sure!
Mr. Slave
[nonchalantly] Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.
Principal Victoria
[over the P.A. system] Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please?
Mr. Garrison
That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome. [shimmies out the door]
Mr. Slave
Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh! [feels the gerbil try again to claw its way out of his ass] Oooooh, Jesus Christ. [scratches his ass. The gerbil runs one way, then back to the sphincter. A specter appears and stops the gerbil in its tracks. It's a Frog King. The two stand motionless for a few seconds]
Frog King
Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out of this place, or you will surely die. [the gerbil just stands there] This way has been closed off by the Great Sphincter. To escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach. [the gerbil says nothing] Who am I? Just a friend. Heed my words, Lemmiwinks. Your time is running out. Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then. [disappears. The gerbil turns around, scratches its chin, and begins its journey]
Singer
A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward, Lemmiwinks, or you will soon be dead.
The journey before you may be long and filled with woe
But you must escape the gay man's ass so your tale can be told.
Lemmiwinks. Lehehemiwinks Lemmiwinks Lemmiwinks-

The principal's office, a few moments later. Mr. Garrison hums as he nears the office door. He enters and stands beside an angry Chef, who has crossed his arms.
Mr. Garrison
You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
Principal Victoria
Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat.
Mr. Garrison
[nudges Chef] Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired. [hums some more and takes a seat]
Principal Victoria
Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods.
Mr. Garrison
[in anticipation, gets melodramatic] Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.
Principal Victoria
No no no we're not firing you.
Mr. Garrison
...You're not?
Principal Victoria
No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar.
Chef
[steps forward] Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!
Principal Victoria
You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class?
Chef
He IS a sick queer!!
Mr. Garrison
Yeah!
Principal Victoria
I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef.
Chef
Kiss my black ass!! [Mr. Garrison is surprised]
South Park Elementary, Counselor Mackey's office.
Mr. Mackey
Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?
Stan
We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
Randy
Well I really thought you boys learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!
Butters
[still distraught] But they killed Lemmiwinks!
Stephen
Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!
Butters
Yes sir.
Stephen
Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn.
Mr. Mackey
Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?
Sharon
That sounds good to me.
Liane
Me too.
Sheila
Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp.
Stan
Tolerance camp?
Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. A truck pulls up to the entrance and two guards open the gates. Beyond, kids mill around under the watchful eyes of other guards. A few moments later a guard paces in front of a crowd of kids.
Camp Warden
[sternly] Welcome to tolerance camp. You are here because you would not accept people's differences. [a shot of the kids shows that Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters were not the only kids to refuse attending Garrison's class] Because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man. Well those days are now over. Here you vill verk, every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody. Here, intolerance... will not be tolerated.
South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. Mr. Slave is reading his magazine. A few moments later Mr. Garrison storms into the room and slams the door shut.
Mr. Garrison
God-damnit!
Mr. Slave
How'd it go?
Mr. Garrison
This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!
Mr. Slave
The principal didn't fire you?
Mr. Garrison
No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
Mr. Slave
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Mr. Garrison
I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!
Mr. Slave
Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are.
Mr. Garrison
Oh well- [stops and thinks] Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave. [paces a bit] The parents have to see for themselves. [snaps his fingers] The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!
Mr. Slave
Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ. [rubs his belly, and the camera zooms in, cutting to the intestine. Lemmiwinks walks along, and a guitar is heard]
Singers
Lemmiwinks journeyed a distance far and fast.
To find his way out of a gay man's ass.
The road ahead is filled with danger and fright
But push onward, Lemmiwinks, with all of your might.

Frog King
[appears again before Lemmiwinks] Lemmiwinks, you are coming to the entrance of the small intestine. There you must seek out the Sparrow Prince. [disappears. Lemmiwinks walks up the large intestine, going back and forth. Eventually it sees the Sparrow Prince and stops]
Singers
The Sparrow Prince lies somewhere way up ahead.
Don't look back, Lemmiwinks, or you'll soon be dead.
Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, the time is growing late.
Slow down now and seal your fate.

Sparrow Prince
I am the Sparrow Prince. Long has my spirit been trapped within this place. Before you lies the maze of the small intestine. One path leads to the stomach, the other to certain doom. Take with you this helmet and torch. [they appear and float toward Lemmiwinks] Let them be your guide. [Lemmiwinks puts it on and continues its journey]
Singers
Take the magic helmet torch to help you light the way.
There's still a lot of ground to cross inside the man so gay.
Ahead of you lies adventure, and your strength still lies within.
Freedom from the Ass of Doom is the treasure you will win.

Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. The kids are in a large room the size of an airport hangar. All of them have been doing arts and crafts, as they are dirty with crayons and paint. Each column of tables is being patrolled by a guard.
Camp Warden
Today we will be using the fingerpaint! You vill make a painting that shows people of different races and sexual orientations getting along. Fingerpaint. Fingerpaint! [the kids get busy fingerpainting] You vill not make any distinction between people of different colors! People with different sexual preferences! You vill accept everyone! [stops behind Kyle's right shoulder and swoops down to look at his paper] What are you fingerpainting?!
Kyle
Uh, a bear?
Camp Warden
Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do with accepting people of different races!
Kyle
[trembling in fear] Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
Camp Warden
[takes Kyle's paper and rips it up] Start over! [puts his hand on the stack of papers next to Kyle] You will fingerpaint what we tell you! [takes a sheet from the stack and slams it down in front of Kyle] GO! [Kyle starts on a new picture] Faster. [the guard switches to the left shoulder without breaking his stare] Faster! [switches back to the right shoulder and cocks a pistol against Kyle's head] Faasterr.
Kyle
Aaaa! [hurries to finish the painting]
Camp Warden
Faster! Are you done?! What is it?! What have you done?! [Kyle adds some broad strokes and lifts up the finished work]
Kyle
[trembling] People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
Camp Warden
GOOD! [snatches the paper from Kyle's hand] That wasn't so hard, was it? [rips it up and tosses it away] NOW DO IT AGAIN! [walks off slowly] Faster! [the kids work faster] Faasterr!
South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. Mr. Garrison talks to Mr. Slave. There are no kids in class, as they've all gone to tolerance camp, apparently.
Mr. Garrison
There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?
Mr. Slave
[scribbling on a notepad] Almost. I just have to get through a su- [grabs his stomach] Uh-huc, Jesus Christ.
Mr. Garrison
What's the matter?
Mr. Slave
Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess.
Mr. Garrison
Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. [hands Mr. Slave a glass of water and a pill]
Mr. Slave
Eugh, Jesus Christ. [takes the pill and swallows it. The camera follows the pill down the esophagus toward the stomach. The pill lands in the pool of acid in the stomach. Lemmiwinks pops up from the pool]
Singers
Lemmiwinks came to the stomach dark.
'Neath the depths of the lungs and heart.

Catatafish
You chose your path wisely, Lemmiwinks. I am the Catatafish.
Singers
Catatafish of the stomach's cove.
Catatafish
If you answer this riddle, the esophagus will let you pass.
Singers
Catatafish's riddle will soon be told.
Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, day. The kids are now in a different room quietly making macaroni pictures on the floor, but they are all fatigued. The guard walks up to a soldier on a catwalk and talks with him.
Camp Warden
Everything in order?
Camp Soldier
Yes, mein Führer. Ve are making the prisoners make macaroni pictures that illustrate diversity in the verkplace.
Camp Warden
[looks at a paper with two people shaking hands and with "DIVERSITY" written above them] Eh-xcellent! [down below the kids continue with their pictures.]
Kyle
[Suddenly falls on his face] Oh.
Stan
Kyle. [helps him up and tries to rouse him] Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
Kyle
[limply] Can't... glue... any... more. [falls on his face again]
Stan
The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
Camp Warden
Take this one away. He is done for. [a soldier drags a boys body along the floor]
Stan
Butters!
Butters
No more... arts and crafts...
Stan
Jesus... we have to get out of here. [other kids are passed out, some on their backs, some on their stomachs]
Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, black-and-white footage, outside. The kids are at play. Cartman walks over to a Porto-Potty and enters, but stops. He looks down into the toilet and finds two girls there in the septic tank.
Girl 1
Please don't tell them that we're hiding here.
Girl 2
We can't work anymore or we'll die.
Camp Soldier
[walking by] Vhat? [closes the door and turns around] Waht?!
Cartman
Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.
Camp Soldier
Vhat is in there?
Cartman
Nothing.
Camp Soldier
Get back to verk.
Cartman
[salutes] Yes sir! [the guard walks away] Phew. [opens the door and steps inside, laughing. A few moments later he craps and starts laughing]
The Girls
Eww! Eww! Eww! [Cartman craps and laughs some more]
Cartman
[exits and alerts any available soldier] Hey, I was just kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! [goes to find a soldier]
Museum of Tolerance, Friday night. The main hall is set up for the awards ceremony and the guests are seated.
Tour Guide
Tonight we are here to honor an amazing fourth grade teacher with the Courageous Teacher award. [applause] Herbert Garrison came out about two years ago. Since then he has faced adversity. He has even faced ridicule by some of the students.
Sharon
Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son.
Tour Guide
It is my honor to present the Courageous Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison. [applause. She moves off as Garrison enters riding on Mr. Slave, humming a song. Mr. Garrison wears a towering headdress while Mr. Slave is dressed as a horse. Mr. Slave stops]
Mr. Garrison
Get along, little Slave.
Randy
Oh my God.
Gerald
That's what our boys were talking about?
Mr. Garrison
[rings some small bells] Ding-ding, ding-ding.
Man 1
[sitting next to Principal Victoria] He is so courageous.
Mr. Garrison
[now at the podium, with Mr. Slave standing to his right. He's wearing a purple belt with shiny purple dildo hanging from it] Say, Mr. Slave.
Mr. Slave
Yes, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.
Mr. Slave
Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole?
Mr. Garrison
No no, I was the asshole. [a moment of silence, and more applause]
Man 2
[brown hair and mustache] Ogh, that is so courageous.
Man 3
[gray hair] What an amazing human being! [Randy and Gerald look at each other in shock]
Mr. Garrison
Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls.
Audience
Ahh [applause]
Mr. Garrison
[frustrated, to Mr. Slave] It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave.
Mr. Slave
I've got a little- Oof. [grabs his stomach] Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?
Inside Mr. Slave's stomach at that moment, Lemmiwinks has been put into a gyroscope and is ready to be shot up the esophagus and out the mouth.
Frog King
Hang on, Lemmiwinks! You solved the Catatafish's riddle. Now your trials are nearly through!
Outside Mr. Slave's stomach, onstage.
Mr. Slave
Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass! [a few moments of thought, and then more applause]
Mr. Garrison
Uh...
Man 4
[black hair] Courageous.
Man 5
[behind him, brown hair] So courageous.
Mr. Garrison
[frustrated and finally letting loose] God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! [the applause dies down]
Man 3
[softly] Oh, that's courageous.
Mr. Garrison
Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!
Mr. Slave
Yeah, Jesus Christ.
Man 6
But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le-rant.
Man 3
[stands up and raises his arms] Yes. The mu-se-um.
Man 7
[stands up and raises his arms] The mu-se-um tells us.
Mr. Garrison
Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance! [the audience looks on] "Tolerate" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!
Randy
He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.
Gerald
We've gotta get our boys back! [gets up and rushes out]
Mr. Garrison
[relieved] Ogh! So now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?!
Principal Victoria
No, no, I think I have a better idea.
Devitzen's Tolerance Camp, Saturday, day. The boys' parents are at the front gate. Black-and-white fades into color, and Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters are present. They are quite thin, clearly undernourished, and their clothes fit loose on them.
Randy
We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
Sheila
Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. [a close-up of the boys shows that Butters is the thinnest of them]
Stephen
Come on, let's go. [the boys and their parents head away from the gate. As they go, Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave are brought in by Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey. Two soldiers have them under gunpoint]
Mr. Garrison
But this is insane!
Principal Victoria
I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior.
Camp Warden
[arrives] Vhat do we have here? Noo recruits? I assure you, the next veek will be nothing but pain and suffering! [pounds his right fist into his left palm]
Mr. Slave
Oooo, this could be kind of fun. [convulses all of a sudden, goes down on hands and knees, and coughs up the gerbil]
Singers
Lemmiwinks has made it out and his tale is nearly through.
[the three spirits he met in Mr. Slave's body now appear before him]

Catatafish
Great job, Lemmiwinks.
Sparrow Prince
Thanks to you we are all free.
Frog King
[draws close to Lemmiwinks] But your adventures are just beginning, for you are no ordinary gerbil, Lemmiwinks. You are the Gerbil King. [places a crown on its head, then backs up to join the other two animal spirits]
The Three Spirits
All hail the Gerbil King. [they disappear]
Singers
Now that you're the Gerbil King there's more ventures to go on
Fly away to faraway lands and to the setting sun
There's still so many enemies and battles yet to fight
For Lemmiwinks the Gerbil King could be told a thousand nights
Lemmi- Lemmi- Lemmiwinks. Le- Lemmiwiiinks.
Lehhmiwinks, Lem- Lem- Lemmiwinks
Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, Leh-miwinks
Leh-miwinks, Gerbil King.]

End of The Death Camp of Tolerance

The Biggest Douche in the Universe
South Park, night. A camera sits atop an ambulance transmitting the action as the ambulance speeds down a street. It ends up at Hell's Pass Hospital. The paramedics rush out and open the cargo doors, quickly take Cartman out and whisk him into Emergency while his mom remains seated anxiously inside the ambulance.
Liane
[steps out of the ambulance] Be careful with my baby.
Hell's Pass Hospital, inside. The paramedics reach the nurses' station and rush by.
Blonde Nurse
What have we got?
Paramedic 1
[black hair] Not sure. It looks like a possible code five six!
Cartman
[disoriented] Kenny. Shut up, Kenny.
Liane
[now helping the nurse and paramedics] You're going to be okay, baby.
Hell's Pass Hospital, operating room. Emergency personnel whisk Cartman into the room. Liane enters, but stays near the door.
Dr. Doctor
[enters ready for surgery] Five me 50 cc's of ketamine, STAT. And get something for the kid, too.
Liane
Is he going to be okay?
Brunette Nurse
Let the doctor do his work, ma'am. [closes the curtain]
Hell's Pass Hospital, a few hours later. Cartman is now in one of the recovery rooms with Liane at his side stroking him gently. He's on a respirator for the time being. The doctor enters the room slowly, but Liane notices and rises to meet him.
Liane
Doctor! Did you find out what's wrong with him?
Dr. Doctor
I'm afraid he's... running out of time.
Liane
[thinks a moment, then] Why?? What's wrong with him??
Dr. Doctor
It's his time. It's ...running out.
Liane
Well, what does he need?
Dr. Doctor
He needs to have more time.
Liane
What can we do?
Dr. Doctor
Well, I suppose we could try a time transplant. I'll have to call in a specialist. [turns and walks out. Liane returns to Cartman]
Liane
[cradles Cartman somewhat] It's going to be okay, baby. We're going to get you more time.
Cartman
Ey Kenny! God-damn you, Kenny!
Chef's house, day. Stan and Kyle go up to the front door and Kyle knocks. Chef opens up and sees them.
Chef
Hello there, children.
Stan
Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
Kyle
Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
Chef
Well what's wrong with him?
Stan
Well, nobody seems to know, but we think it's because he drank Kenny's soul four weeks ago.
Kyle
Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
Chef
Children, why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
Kyle
Well like we said, we didn't know whether or not we should care?
Chef
Well, you should. Cartman is your friend whether you like him or not! Now, come on! We've gotta get to that hospital!
Hell's Pass Hospital, Cartman's recovery room. Dr. Doctor has returned.
Liane
He's looking a little better today.
Dr. Doctor
Yes, but his time is still getting weaker. It will give out soon unless we do something. [the door opens and Chef, Stan and Kyle enter]
Cartman
[cheerfully] Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
Chef
Cartman?
Stan
No, that's Kenny.
Cartman
[surly] What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
Stan
That's Cartman.
Chef
[approaches and has a look] Oh my God! Eric, how long have you been channelin' Kenny?
Cartman
Oh, about a month.
Dr. Doctor
Let's not validate his delusions.
Chef
Kenny? Kenny, do you know what you need to get free?
Cartman
He's gone again.
Chef
Ms. Cartman, we need to get Eric to a medium who can speak with people who have crossed over.
Dr. Doctor
What?? That's preposterous! What this child needs is a time transplant!
Chef
This hospital isn't gonna do any good. We need to take him to see John Edward.
Stan
Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
Chef
That's right. We have to go see him in New York.
Dr. Doctor
I warn you, Ms. Cartman. Your son's time could give out at any minute. He needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored.
Liane
Oooh, what should I do? I'm playing roulette with my child's life! [switches mind gears] Ooo wait, Hairspray is showing in New York, isn't it? Let's go there.
Chef
Good. You children need to come too. Eric needs all the support he can get right now.
Kyle
We're going to New York?
An airplane to New York, dawn. The plane is flying above the clouds.
Flight Attendant
Welcome aboard Flight 673 to New York. We are happy to show you a feature film during the flight. In a moment we'll be showing a preview.
Kyle
[the boys begin to put on headphones] Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
Stan
Awesome!
The preview.
Announcer
Rob Schneider was an animal. [a shot of him on all fours running through the forest] Then he was a woman. [Rob steps out of a shower and inspects his new breasts. He's shocked] And now Rob Schneider is... [a shot of him sitting on a desk dressed as a stapler, stapling papers together] a stapler. [he's showing being a stapler in front of some cheering frat boys from Gamma Gamma Delta] And he's about to find out... [he's shown trying to catch a bus as a stapler] that being a stapler [he's shown with a woman, still as a stapler. He tries to get close to her, but falls off the sofa] is harder than it looks. Rob Schneider is... The Stapler. [title graphics show up] Rated PG-13.
Stan, Kyle
[remove their headphones] Weak!
Cartman
[giggles] Ha-heheheh. [the boys look at him; he takes his headphones off and looks at them] That was Kenny laughing, not me.
New York, the skyline. Chef, Liane, and the boys arrive at an HBC studio for John Edward.
Chef
This must be the place.
Page
Okay audience members, hi, welcome to the taping of the show. [she collects tickets from members as they enter the studio] It's all general seating in there, and just remember, Mr. Edward might not hear from the particular dead person you wanna talk to, so just... keep an open mind.
Chef
Don't worry, Eric. I'm sure he will be able to help you.
John Edward's studio, show set. The seats are all filled up.
Announcer
Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward. [applause. John enters the set and steps on stage]
John Edward
Thank you, thank you. Alright let's get started. [meditates a minute, then points to his right] 'S coming from over here. 'S the name Mike mean anything to anybody? [no reaction] I'm getting um, I'm getting M-mike? Definitely an M, d'um, maybe Matt? Mike? Matt? Mi-mmm, Mi-Mike, m-Mary?
Man 1
Mary was my mother!
John Edward
Okay okay, and she-she's she died?
Man 1
[begins to sob. A woman comforts him] Yes. Yeh-yes she did.
John Edward
Okay, and she's telling me there's something about... the money. That the, the money is safe? Is that making sense? [the man and woman look up]
Man 1
M-mm-m. Not really.
John Edward
Must be from somewhere else in the audience, then. Uh, d'uh, money? Is someone el-
Stan
Uh, over here please?
Kyle

John Edward
Kenny says hi.
Audience Members
Wow! [applause] wow...
John Edward
Okay, now I'm getting that Kenny ...died?
Stan
We told you that.
John Edward
And, and this wasn't, this wasn't a good death. It was like a, it was a sad death. It was like a, it was like a death that made people sad. Does that make sense?
Kyle
Yee-yeah.
Audience Members
[applause] Oh, wow, that's incredible! Wow!
Chef
Look uh, Mr. Edward, can you just ask Kenny how we can get him out, please?
John Edward
[blocking] Doesn't work that way. [turns his attention to the boys] Now, Kenny is telling me that... you're his best friends, and he's in a ss-safe place.
Stan
No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.
John Edward
Ohh, there's somebody with him. Who's Kyle?
Kyle
I'm Kyle.
John Edward
Oh right. And uh, did an older woman pass, she's asking for Kyle? Maybe a grandma?
Kyle
[responding] Yeah. My Grandma. [looks around] She's here?
John Edward
She says there was something she asked you to do, and you're not doing it? She wants you to look for four white doves.
Kyle
Oh my God!
John Edward
Oh now she's sending me a P word. Maybe it's a puh-? Or a huh-?
Woman 1
My Harry died last year!
John Edward
Oh, it's comin' from over here. [moves to the woman's side of the audience] I'm getting all kinds of voices today. [does a small skip] Woo! [laughter]
Stan
Heh hey wait a minute dude.
John Edward
Okay now Harry. He's telling me... oh well, he's saying that you two used to... do things.
Woman 1
[sobs and nods vigorously] Mmm-hmm.
John Edward
And that those things involved... stuff?
Woman 1
The things did involve stuff, yes. [cries. The audience is awed and gets somewhat boisterous]
New York, outside John Edward's studio. Chef, Liane and the boys exit. Kyle is missing.
Chef
Aw man, I can't believe I got fooled by that asshole!
Stan
He seemed better on TV?
Chef
Yeah. They must edit his shows down on television to only show him getting mostly right answers.
Kyle
[exits the studio a bit panicked.] Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
Stan
[approaches Kyle] Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? [Cartman has a seizure; the other boys look over. Cartman goes silent, and he's shown standing unconscious.]
Liane
Eric? [the others draw closer] It must be his time. I think it's running out!
Chef
We've got no choice. The only people I know now who might be able to help Eric are my parents. We'll have to take the next flight to Scotland.
New York Airport, day. The kids, Chef and Liane are ready for their flights.
Chef
[walks to Stan and Kyle and gives them their tickets] Okay children, this is your flight back to Colorado. Your parents are meeting you at the airport in Denver.
Stan
We don't get to go to Scotland?
Liane
It's too far and your parents want you back home.
Stan
[to Cartman] Oh well. Good luck getting Kenny out of you, fatso.
Cartman
Thanks, asshole.
Chef
Come on, we gotta catch our plane. You children get right on that plane now.
Announcer
This is the final boarding announcement for Flight 342 to Denver.
Stan
[moving off slowly] That's us. Come on.
Kyle
Four white birds!
Stan
Huh?
Kyle
There's four white birds! [Sees a sign for Jewleeard, a private school for young Jews. The sign has four birds in flight above a small school, two stars of David flanking the building, and two traditional Jewish men in overcoats, one at each end of the sign. A phone number is shown underneath. Kyle and Stan walk closer to the sign] This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
Stan
Dude, you were going to see four white birds eventually.
Kyle
So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
Stan
Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. [walks off]
Kyle
I'm not going back.
Stan
[stops and looks at Kyle, astonished] What??
Kyle
I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud! [drops his ticket on the ground] Tell my parents I'll call them. [hurries away]
Stan
Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! [slaps his left palm on his face]
John Edward's estate, later. Stan arrives and goes to the front door. Needless to say, he didn't get on the plane either. He rings the bell and is greeted by the butler.
Stan
Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
Butler
He doesn't do private readings.
Stan
I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
Butler
Alright, come on in. [steps aside for Stan to enter]
John Edward's estate, living room. Stan waits by the sofa.
Butler
Just wait here. I'll go fetch him. [the butler walks into another area of the house]
Stan
Jesus Christ.
Butler
[returns] Here he is. [presses a button next to a wide doorway]
Prerecorded Voice
Ladies and Gentlemen, John Edward. [John approaches and the butler presses a second button for applause]
John Edward
Thank you, thank you.
Stan
Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
John Edward
Oh. [pulls out a card from his pocket and reads aloud] The John Edward show is not liable for opinions and materials given for entertainment purposes only. [silence for a few seconds]
Stan
Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
John Edward
Maybe it is for real.
Stan
Right, but it's not. It's a trick you do and I need you to just let my friend Kyle know that so he can go on with his life.
John Edward
Look, people have the right to be skeptical. I really hear voices in my head.
Stan
Yes. We all hear voices in our heads. It's called "intuition." Get over yourself and tell my friend it's just for fun.
John Edward
Look, what I do doesn't hurt anybody. I give people closure and help them cope with life.
Stan
No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
John Edward
But I'm a psychic.
Stan
No dude, you're a douche.
John Edward
I'm not a douche! What if I really believe that dead people talk to me?
Stan
Then you're a stupid douche.
John Edward
I think I've had of your bullying me! Get out of my house or I'll runs upstairs, lock myself in my panic room and call the police!
Stan
I'm nine years old.
John Edward
I'm not talking to your friend and I'm not a douche! [runs up the stairs and towards his room as his voice gets whinier] You'd better get out of my house, 'cause I'm gonna call the police! [Stan looks at him like he's nuts; he locks himself in his panic room]
Stan
You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche! [walks towards the door, but notices some books on a bookcase nearby. He checks them out. "How To Be A Psychic" "Cold Reading: The Trick Of The Psychic!" "Make Women Believe You're Psychic! Then Have Sex With Them!" "How To Sixty Nine With Yourself" ...Stan senses the real reason behind John's efforts] Son of a bitch. [takes the books and leaves the estate.]
An airplane to Scotland, day. The plane is flying above the clouds. In the cabin, Cartman sits between Chef and Liane.
Cartman
Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
Liane
Hang in there, sweetie. We'll be there soon.
Pilot
Welcome aboard Scotland Air. Our trip to Edinburgh should take about twelve hours.
Cartman
Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
Pilot
In the meantime we'd like to show you a complimentary film.
Cartman
Oh, good. [All passengers put on their headsets.]

Rob Schneider

Cartman
Oh for the love of Christ. [switches from miffed to excited] I wanna watch, fat boy! [...and back to miffed] No, Kenny, it's not funny!
The Jewleeard School, New York. Kyle approaches the school. Stan runs up to intercept him.
Stan
Kyle! Kyle!
Kyle
Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
Stan
Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
Kyle
He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
Stan
Kyle, you can't run your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called "cold reading." They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
Man 2
[listening, he approaches] Hey, whoa now. John Edward is for real.
Stan
No, he's not.
Woman 2
Yeah. My sister told me he knew our mother's name and when she died. [other adults begin to arrive and give testimony]
Construction Worker
John Edward? Oh yeah, I heard he walked up to a guy on the street, and said his dead father wanted to say "Happy Birthday," and it WAS his birthday.
Woman 3
Yeah kid, how do you explain that?
Stan
[looks around at the adults, then] Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
Woman 4
Oh-ho. Me? [steps forward. The others clap]
Stan
Okay, I'm gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you, okay?
Woman 4
Okay.
Stan
Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
Woman 4
My father?
Stan
Does this month, November, hold a special significance?
Woman 4
[gasps] My birthday's in November!
Stan
Right, because he's saying, "Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'"
Woman 4
Oh my God.
Stan
See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
Man 2
Well then how'd you know her birthday was in November?
Stan
I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying "He wishes you a Happy Birthday."
Woman 4
[gasps] What else does he say?
Stan
Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He's saying "the money. Stop worrying about the money."
Woman 4
[gasps] Oh my God! My sister and I have been fighting over his inheritance.
Woman 3
That's amazing.
Stan
No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
Man 3
That sounds a little too coincidental.
Man 4
Yes. There's only one explanation. This kid can communicate with the dead!
Adults
Wow!
Stan
What?! [his deconstruction didn't work. The adults crowd in]
Man 2
Do me next. I wanna talk to my mother.
Woman 3
Can you try to reach my grandfather.
Stan
No wait.
Construction Worker
You have to tell me if my sister's in a good place. [Kyle walks away from the crowd and into Jewleeard]
Man 5
Yeah, help me out too, 'k?
Man 6
I'm next. I'm next.
Man 7
Hey, get out of my way!
Man 8
Do me!
Scout
Kid, how would you like your own talking to the dead show?
Scotland, day, highlands. Night falls. Chef, Liane and Cartman arrive at the McElroy manor and Chef knocks on the door. Bagpipes that were playing stop. Mr. McElroy, Chef's dad, answers the door.
Chef
Hi Pop.
Thomas
Junior! Aw, son, it's good to see you now.
Chef
These are my friends, the Cartmans. [presents them]
Thomas
Well come on in out of the cold now. [the guests enter] There's heavy fog on the moors tonight. [closes the door, then leads them to the living room] Well, look what the cat dragged in, Nelle.
Nelle
Oh, my baby come home!
Chef
Hi, Momma! [gives her a hug]
Nelle
Lord, I thought you wasn't comin' till nine.
Chef
Mom, this is my friend, Ms. Cartman.
Liane
Please, call me Liane.
Nelle
So nice to have you here, Liane.
Thomas
And is this the children you told us about?
Chef
Yeah, Pop. This is Eric.
Thomas
Well, let's see here now. [genuflects and checks Cartman out in various places on the body] Mhm, mhm, mhm. [stands up] Yeup! There's definitely more than one children in there.
Liane
Oh dear.
Thomas
Nelle, you best have at it now.
Nelle
Oh Lord, and I just put the roast in the oven, too. [walks off to the kitchen muttering] Ain't gonna have no time now to baste it. Don't nobody blame me, a woman can't bake no roast and do everything else at the same time. [Thomas walks off to his left] Can't say that the roast is gonna be terrible, maybe just a little dry. [Thomas returns with a stool] But I suppose we can make some extra gravy to take the dryness out later. [Nelle returns dressed as a shaman with angel wings]
Thomas
Alright, children, stand up on this chair now.
Cartman
Right now?
Thomas
Yes, right now. [Cartman steps up on the small stool and Nelle begins to work on him.]
Nelle
[waving her scepters] Na kamaa karash meh nah- [strikes Cartman]
Cartman
Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
Nelle
Come out now. Come out now.
Chef
Just stay still, Eric. Mom knows what she's doing.
Nelle
You all come out of there now.
"The Other Side".
Announcer
At a very young age one young boy learned he had a special gift. This is "The Other Side." [the curtain rises to reveal Stan on set with the studio audience clapping. He steps forward and the curtain falls down behind him]
Stan
Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully. [the applause dies down] This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay? [puts his hand to his temple] They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
Woman 5
[jumps up] Yes! Yes, my Peter! [begins to sob]
Audience
Wow!! [begins to clap]
Stan
No! Stop clapping! All I did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response. Now that I see that there's a lone woman crying, my instinct tells me Peter was her husband. So I say, "Peter was your husband?"
Woman 5
[sobbing] Yes, yes! Yes, my husband Peter!
Audience
Wow!! [begins to clap]
Woman 6
Oh wow!
Stan
[getting annoyed] Stop it! I didn't do anything!
Man 9
[rises and accuses] You knew Peter was dead!
Stan
[reminding] I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, "They want me to acknowledge Peter." That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, "I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely."
Woman 5
[sobbing] Yes, it was.
Audience
Wow!! [begins to clap]
Man 10
Amazing!
Woman 7
Ask Peter if he knows my little Billy.
Stan
[frustrated, with right hand over his clenched eyelids] Okay. Let's back up. [each audience row backs up to the one behind it] Not literally!
McElroy manor, night. Nelle is still working on Cartman. He's laying on a bed, and Chef's dad helps in the exorcism.
Thomas
In the name of all that is holy we demand this spirit be set free!
Cartman
Ahh, Aahhhh! [the adults back away from the bed. Soon, an orange glow appears on Cartman's belly]
Thomas
There we go! We're gettin' somethin' now!
Nelle
Come on out, spirit. Go!
Thomas
Come on out hyow! It's safe! [Cartman groans with the pain Kenny's spirit is causing him. Thomas quickly moves to the foot of the bed] Here it comes! The spirit is comin' out hyuh! [a timer goes off]
Nelle
Oooo, that's the potatoes. [she removes all her costume and heads to the kitchen]
Thomas
[a few seconds later] Well hold on the potatoes two seconds, woman! [Nelle stops and turns around] The soul's comin' out hyuh! [Cartman writhes on the bed as Kenny's spirit now glows from Cartman's pants] It's almost done. Alright, son. Now bring me the victim child!
Chef
The victim child?
Thomas
Yeah. You know, the child that we sacrifice so we can put Kenny's soul into its body. [Chef looks off to his right. Liane and Thomas follow his gaze]
Nelle
Oh Lord, they didn't bring a victim child.
Chef
Where were we gonna find a child to sacrifice?
Nelle
We weren't gonna ask you where you got it from. [Cartman groans once more, and Kenny's spirit bolts out and bounces around the room. The adults try to dodge it]
Thomas
God-damnit! The spirit's out and it don't have no where to go!
Nelle
Lord, Thomas, don't let it get on the curtains.

The Jewleeard School, New York. Kyle is studying. Stan approaches him with a stack of papers.
Stan
Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
Kyle
You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
Stan
Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! [throws the stack away and leaves. He reaches the front doors, opens them, and is face-to-face with John Edward]
John Edward
So, you think you can talk to dead people better than me, huh?!
Stan
No, I don't think either one of us can. [Kyle gets up from his seat and leaves the room]
John Edward
They told me your show is getting better ratings than mine, that you're saying I'm a fraud on your show! You'd better not ever call me a liar, or a fake, or a douche again, or else I'll sue you for slander!
Stan
I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
John Edward
Everything I tell people is positive and gives them hope! How does that make me a douche?!
Stan
Because the big questions in life are tough: Why are we here? Where are we from? Where are we going? But if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you, we're never gonna find the real answer to those questions. You aren't just lying, you're slowing down the progress of all mankind, you douche!
John Edward
I'M NOT A DOUCHE! And I challenge you to a psychic showdown! I'll prove to the world that I'm psychic and you're not!
Stan
Fine, douche! [slams one door on him...]
John Edward
I'm not a douche! [...then the other]
The McElroy manor, night. Kenny's spirit is now in the living room flitting about. Thomas enters with a broom, swinging it around to capture it somehow.
Thomas
Well come on, the soul's in here! It can't escape now. [Liane and Chef enter the room] It's goin' to the light! Unfortunately, it's the livin' room light.
Nelle
I'll open a window, you try to chase it out, Thomas.
Thomas
Go on now, soul now!
Nelle
Here, spirit, come out the window. [opens a window] I'll give you tree-fiddy. [holds out some money for the spirit]
Thomas
Now don't go offerin' the soul no tree-fiddy, woman!
Nelle
I'm just tryin' to persuade it.
Thomas
Well I know, but you can at least start at about two quarter or somethin' [the spirit comes out of the light and flits out of the living room] Aw Christmas, there it goes again!
Nelle
[drops the money] It's headin' for the kitchen! Aw, Thomas, the pot roast! [heads for the kitchen after the spirit]
The McElroy manor, kitchen. Kenny's spirit flits in and bounces around the kitchen. The adults enter, hot on its trail.
Thomas
Over here!
Liane
Get it down.
Nelle
Don't let it get in the roast! [the spirit moves over the roast. The others move with it, but the spirit dives into the pot roast, making it bounce. The adults crowd in and look at the pot roast]
Thomas
Oh. Well. I guess the child's a pot roast now.
Chef
What do we do with it now?
Nelle
[turns around to get something] Well I'll wrap it up with some plastic wrap so you can take it home with ya. Should last a few months in the freezer. [turns around with a box of Saran Wrap]
Cartman
[entering refreshed] Hey, ah I feel a lot better.
Chef
Eric, you're okay! [the others gather around him. Liane kneels to hug him]
Liane
Oh, baby, your time is back!
Nelle
[lays a hand on Cartman's head and pronounces] This child is clean.
The John Edward studio.
Announcer
Ladies and Gentlemen, it's "Psychic Showdown." Here are John Edward, and Stan Marsh. [both of them enter and get on stage. The studio audience applauds]
John Edward
Thank you. [the applause dies down. He turns to Stan] Alright, asshole! I know you're here to try to throw me off, so go ahead. Give me your best shot!
Stan
No, I don't wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to the audience.
John Edward
Wah-why?
Stan
You see, I learned something today. At first I thought you were all just stupid, listening to this douche's advice, but now I understand that you're all here because you're scared. You're scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding. You all want to believe in it so much, I know you do. You find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you, but think about it: Is that really what you want? To just be floating around after you die, having to talk to this asshole? [the audience is listening] We need to recognize this stuff for what it is: magic tricks. Because whatever's really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche. [more audience listening, reflection. Kyle is present. One man claps, then others clap with him, then murmurs are heard]
Audience Members
Yes. Right. Yeah. [John looks angrily at Stan]
Kyle
[now next to Stan with fake beard in hand] You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
Stan
Yeah.
John Edward
But I do have a special power! I know I do!
Stan
There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
John Edward
God-damnit, I'm special!! [a rumble is heard, the studio shakes, and a bright light shines from above. John, Stan and Kyle look up in wonder]
Man 11
What the?
Woman 8
Aaaah! [the ceiling above the studio begins to crack, and a huge red spacecraft breaks through, descending to the ground. Stan and Kyle step back. The craft settles down and a door opens downward to become a staircase. Aliens appear and descend the stairs]
Lead Alien
[with two noses, and a pair of eyes for each nose. The eyes stick out like antennae] Greetings from the Jannex Galaxy. [the other aliens take a bow] We seek the great John Edward.
John Edward
Why that... that's me!
Lead Alien
Sir, it is an honor to meet you. [extends his... "hand"]
John Edward
[extends his hand and gives the alien a handshake] Well, thank you very much! [looks smugly at Stan]
Stan
No, it can't be.
Lead Alien
I am Quagmar, and this is the Intergalactic BDIU Committee. Mr. Edward, it is my honor to inform you that you have been nominated for Biggest Douche In the Universe! [the other aliens clap]
John Edward
What?!
Alien 2

Stan
Oh, dude! [smiles]
Alien 2
If you step into our plabpa feed, we'll give you a first-class ride to the awards show. [the aliens escort him into the spacecraft]
John Edward
No, wait! I'm not a douche! I make people feel good about themselves! [the door closes and the spacecraft takes off] I give people resolution! [the craft is seen going straight up, then off in a random direction. Stan and Kyle look on, then they turn around]
Stan
Now do you people believe me?
Man 12
Well I don't know. How did Edward know my father died in March?
Denver International Airport, day. Cartman, Liane, and Chef exit the airport.
Cartman
God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
Liane
Oh it's so good to have you acting like yourself again, sweetie.
Chef
Well, come on. We'd better get Kenny back to his parents. Wait a minute. Who's got the pot roast?
Liane
I thought you got it.
Cartman
It's still at baggage claim!
Chef
Aw, damnit! Come on! [they go back into the airport] We've gotta find him! Kenny!
Commercial.
Announcer
Rob Schneider is a somewhat popular comedic actor [he's seen dancing around on the red carpet on his way into the Chinese theater] who seemed to have it all, [now sitting at his desk counting his millions] until one day, he came across a pot roast, [standing in line at Denver International, he sees the pot roast on a table. The roast is labeled "Chef McElroy, South Park"] and his life changed forever. [he's taken the roast home and is carving it up and eating it. He senses something is wrong] Now he's sharing his body with an eight-year-old boy. [first, on a hobby elephant as the kids watch then, in Kenny's room getting dressed; then, waiting at the bus stop with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman] And he's about to find out [now getting on his desk and dancing] that being eight [now on all fours attempting to kiss Millie. Barbrady and partner show up; next, he's running down the street trying to escape the officers] ain't so great.

My Future Self n' Me
South Park, woods, night. Six boys look at a tree stump surrounded by litter. They are Jimmy, Token, Craig, Clyde, Kyle, and Cartman. Kyle is carrying a black trash bag. On the stump is a marijuana joint and some paper.
Kyle
[thrusts the bag at Clyde] Throw it away, Clyde!
Clyde
I'm not gonna touch it. You throw it away.
Stan
[arriving] What's going on?
Kyle
[points at the joint] Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
Stan
So throw it away.
Clyde
Nobody wants to touch it.
Kyle
What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say?
Craig
Yeah, didn't you see that commercial where it says that if you have pot you could become a terrorist?
Clyde
And the commercial where the two kids have pot and the one kids shoots the other. Harmless?
Stan
You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.
Token
How do you know? None of us had ever had any drugs before.
Jimmy
Well, I did Ecstasy once. [the other boys look at him] Me and my girlfriend took it and we stayed up all night having... sex. [the other boys just stare]
Kyle
...Where did you have sex with her?
Jimmy
In her... va-vagina. [smiles, but the other boys remain silent] Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience.
Stan
[annoyed at his friends' skittishness] It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
Cartman
[takes the bag from Kyle and offers it to Stan] Then you throw it away, smartass. [Stan walked into that one]
Stan
Fine, I will. [takes the bag and walks over to the stump, faces the boys, and tosses the joint into the bag] There, see? I touched marijuana. I'm not a terrorist, I didn't shoot anybody, and I don't feel like doing more drugs now. No big deal.
South Park, night. To the sound of dramatic music, lightning relentlessly flashes all over town. Stan's house is shown as lightning strikes it. In the living room Stan watches "The Osbournes" with his grandfather. Ozzy is shown in his living room talking to his kids.
Ozzy
You kids fucking don't fuck around with your fucking mom!
Jack
Dad, we fucking can't! It's a big flick a fuck!
Sharon
[enters scolding] Stan, what did I tell you about watching The Osbournes?
Stan
Aw, come on, Mom.
Sharon
It's going to make you retarded! [starts flipping channels, then settles on a news report, then walks away]
Stan
It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
Grandpa Marvin
Oh goody. Now we can watch the news.
Tom
In other news, South Park police are still looking for a craaazy man who terrorized the town one hour ago. [a silhouette of a man running is behind the words "CRAZY MAN" and a question mark is on the silhouette] The man claimed to be from the future and ran naked through the city streets screaming "The past! The past! Oh my God, it's the past!" Which is what one would expect someone from the future to yell. [a knock is heard on the front door, Sharon goes to answer it. Before her stands a disheveled man with long brown hair and stubbly beard. He's wrapped in a large towel and wears a blue cap with red piping and puff, like Stan does]
Naked Man
[slurring his voice] Oh my God, it's the past! [looks at Sharon] Oh, whoa man, it's you!
Sharon
Who are you?
Naked Man
It's me, Mom, your son Stan. [Sharon looks shocked, and the camera zooms in on that. Behind her, still watching TV, are Stan and Marvin. Stan looks over]
Randy
[joining Sharon at the door] Who is it, Sharon?
Naked Man
Dad!
Randy
Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
Stan
[rises from the sofa and walks over] Who the fuck is it, Mom and Dad?
Naked Man
No way, it's me from the past! [looks quite relieved]
Stan
I'm me from the past?
Future Stan
[genuflects to Stan, who leans back a bit] No, I'm you from the future! [rises, and Randy helps him up] Oh man, this is so messed up.
Randy
[pushing the man out the door] Okay, we've had enough!
Future Stan
Your name's Randy Marsh, you're a geologist, and you don't like chicken. Mom, your maiden name is Kimble and you have a scar on your left knee from when you slipped in the swimming pool.
Sharon
[in hushed tones] Randy, what's going on?
Randy
[in hushed tones] I don't know.
Future Stan
Dude, just let me talk to you for like, five minutes. After that I'll bail.
The Marsh dining room. The naked man is now dressed in street clothes and seated at the head of the table. He's enjoying a beer and regular cigarette. The others look dazed and confused at the man as he recounts his memories.
Future Stan
I can still remember when I was five and you both found that squirrel I'd been keeping in the closet and, you let me keep it for another week and then it ran away but... I know that's just what you told me. I know that Mom had actually let it out.
Randy
How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
Sharon
But why are you back in this time with us, son?
Future Stan
I have no idea, man. I was just about to go asleep in an alley behind the crackhouse, [Stan is aghast at what he would become] and I shot up a little heroin, and then this electrical storm started. Next thing I knew I was running around in my own past, man. I thought... I was just tripping, but then I came down and I was still here. Oh, dude, it's so bizarre!
Stan
Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
Randy
[laying hands on the man's shoulder] Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.
Sharon
[reaching out] That's right. We're a family no matter what time shift.
Future Stan
Thanks. Can I get another beer?
Sharon
You must be exhausted. Why don't you get some sleep?
Future Stan
That'd be killer. Where can I crash?
Sharon
Well I'm sure Stan wouldn't mind sharing his room, would you, Stan?
Stan
What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! [squeezes his eyes shut and buries them in his right hand]
Singer
Here we are, face to face, "My Future Self -n- Me"
[Stan and Future Stan stroll down a road. Future Stan has a beer]

Stan
[right at the camera] Stop it.
Singer
So much alike, and yet so different
Stan
[Stan's future self joins him in bed after freshening up in the bathroom] No.
Singer
One of them's messy, the other one's clean!
[Stan's future self turns off the light while Stan looks pissed off]
Gettin' along isn't always easy, sometimes we disagree
[Stan's future self brushes his teeth as Stan stands next to him, avoiding him. Future Stan spits his frothy toothpaste into the sink]

Stan
Quit it.
Singer
But in the end we know we're good for each other
[both Stans eat cereal, but the future Stan has trouble pouring milk into his bowl. It splashes out of the bowl along with some cereal. Stan just buries his face in his hands in frustration]
Two peas in a pod, Future Self -n- Me
Future Self -n- Me, Future Self -n-
[Now they have separate beds. Stan turns the light out and tries to sleep. Future Stan reaches over to turn it on. Stan moves to turn it on, and they fight over the switch until one of them sleeps]
Me

Bus stop, next day. Stan arrives with future Stan.
Stan
Hey guys.
Kyle, Cartman
Hey.
Future Stan
Whoa, Kyle and Cartman! It's so cool to see you guys.
Cartman
Who's this asshole?
Stan
This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
Kyle
Wow. That's pretty cool.
Cartman
Then how does he know our names?
Kyle
'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
Cartman
Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
Future Stan
Yeah, I spent a lot of my teenage years on a slow downward spiral experimenting with drugs and alcohol. [Cartman has a hearty laugh]
Stan
Shut up, Cartman!
Cartman
That is so awesome!! Thank you God! [bows deeply] Oh praise God!
Kyle
Hey, what happens to me in the future?
Future Stan
Oh, I don't know. You guys stayed away from drugs, so you're okay. I just lost touch with you after I was sent to Juvi Hall in 2006.
Cartman
[pats Stan on the back] Juvi Hall! [laughs heartily, then gloats] Stan's a loser! Stan's a loser! [laughs heartily]
Stan
[under his breath] God-damnit!
South Park Elementary, after school, Garrison's classroom. Stan and Butters are seated next to each other, and there are no other kids around.
Stan
Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
Butters
Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
Stan
I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
Butters
Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
Stan
I just can't stand having my future self around all the time! It's driving me crazy! [gets off his seat and starts pacing the floor] Maybe if I get smarter I won't become him and I won't have to share my room!
Butters
I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
Stan
Yeah, it's like everything I do, he... [stops and then looks at Butters] Wait a minute, what'd you say?
Butters
I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. [Stan is surprised by this account]
Stan
[after a moment] Dude, how long has your future self been around?
Butters
Oh. I guess it's been about four months now.
Stan
Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself from the future??
Butters
Nobody asked.
Stan
Where is he now?
Butters
Probably watching Becker.
Butters' house, afternoon. A future Butters is watching TV and eating chips at the sofa.
Becker
My name is T. Becker. The T stand for Terrific. [laughs. Future Butters finds this quite funny. Stan and Butters enter the house to meet future Butters.]
Butters
See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
Future Butters
Stan! Sure I remember you. Yep. Wearing that puff-ball hat like always.
Linda
[walks in with a plate holding a glass of water and a bottle] Oh, hello boys. Future Butters, it's time to take your liver medicine.
Stan
Liver medicine?
Butters
Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school. [an air of determination appears] I need to learn to behave myself! [Stan crosses his arms and gets mad, then bolts for the door] Hey! Where are you going, Stan? [follows Stan out.]
Stan's house, moments later. Stan rushes into his room with Butters in tow.
Stan
Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!
Butters
Wha-, what are you lookin' for, huh Stan?
Stan
Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? [starts rifling through future Stan's clothes]
Butters
Well we both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
Stan
Here it is. [pulls out a wallet and reads the license. It's from the future, with LOSER printed in large letters on it and an expiration date of 10-19-2043] It has to be something eh... Wait, what's this? [pulls out a Motivation Corp. key card, expiring on 12/26/02] This expires in two thousand two. Why would he have this in his wallet?
Butters
I don't follow.
Stan
[flips the card over to see the info on the other side] Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. [heads out the door.]
Butters
[excitedly] Oh! Are we out for an adventure? [follows Stan out]
Denver, night. A bus drives up to a curb on the seedy street, then takes off. Stan and Butters walk down the street.
Stan
Here it is. Motivation Corp. [the camera pans up to show the name of the building. Stan puts the card into the reader next to the door. The door opens and Stan heads in.]
Butters
[turns away. Stan stops right at the entrance] I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
Stan
[walks up to Butters] Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. [heads in]
Butters
Oh. Well, you're good at adventurin', huh Stan? [follows Stan in and closes the door.]
Motivation Corp., interior. Stan and Butters look down a long hallway. Stan notices a window and looks in. Several workers are at their computers matching kids up with actors who are to portray their futures selves.
Stan
What the hell is going on here?
A Voice
It should take about a month to achieve the results you want. [Stan hears the voice and pulls Butters behind some bushes underneath the window. Stan peeks out over the bushes. The director appears with a couple ] Well, Mr. and Mrs. Brooks, I think you're going to be very pleased with the results.
Mr. Brooks
We sure hope so. We just don't know how to talk to our son about drugs.
Director
Well now you won't have to! Ah, here he is. This is Josh Casher. He'll be playing the role of your future son.
Josh
Nice to meet you, "Mom and Dad." [they all laugh heartily]
Mrs. Brooks
My goodness, he does look a little like Kevin.
Director
Yes, and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house. And he's worked up quite a future for your son.
Josh
I'm going to tell him that I dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years, where I was sodomized. In the ass.
Mrs. Brooks
Woohoo, that should get Kevin to stay clear of drugs.
Mr. Brooks
Heh it sure should, heh.
Director
Alright, so we'll put the fake news report out on Tuesday night. Make sure your son is watching the Channel 4 News.
Mr. Brooks
Oh, and that's when uh you'll fake the electrical storm as well?
Director
Motivation Corp. takes care of everything. [hands out some stapled sheets of paper] Just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives.
Mrs. Brooks
[reads from her script] "Listen to me, you crazy person, there's no way you can be from the future." Oh this is going to be fun.
Motivation Corp., interior. Stan hurries out of there with Butters close behind.
Stan
I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
Butters
Yeah, I can't believe it!
Stan
They've all been lying to us this whole time!
Butters
This whole time! I wonder if my future self knows anything about this? [thinks about this a minute. Stan lowers his eyelids to half-closed as he realizes Butters is still clueless] Hey, maybe my future self remembers this happening, a-and can shed some light on this subject.
Stan
[closes his eyes a bit, then] Butters, don't you get it?! Those assholes aren't our future selves! Our parents hired them to make us more motivated!
Butters
Eh, but then why did they come back to the past.
Stan
They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
Butters
Oh... Oohhhh. [Stan rolls his eyes] But that's like they're lyin'.
Stan
It is lying, Butters. Your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me! Get it!
Butters
Ohhh, that makes me angry! Why, if Professor Chaos were here he'd make everyone pay!
Stan
Who's that?
Butters
You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
Stan
What?
Butters
Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! [heads off. This time, Stan follows]
Butters' house, later. An upper light is on. Butters leads Stan into his bedroom.
Butters
Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. [slides his closet door open, steps inside the closet, and slides the door shut]
Stan
We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
Butters
[jumps out of the closet and cackles] Now you know my terrible secret!
Stan
...You're gay? [Butters loses his moment] It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
Butters
Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.
Stan
But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! [walks off]
Butters
[walks downtrodden to the mirror and looks at himself] Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
Stan's room, next day. Stan and Butters are on the floor. Butters is reading the newspaper as Stan watches on.
Butters
How about this? Winter Park. It looks kinda nice.
Stan
No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.
Butters
Wow, look at this, Stan. [reads from the paper] "Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed."
Stan
[heading for the phone] Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. [picks up the phone receiver and starts punching in the numbers]
Butters
Hey look, somebody lost their cat.
Stan
Uh, hi, is this the Parental Revenge Center of Western America? [listens for the answer] Ah I'm really pissed off at my parents and I wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them?
Butters
Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
Stan
[still on the phone] Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please? [listens and writes down the address] Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
Butters
This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
Stan
Eleven o'clock is great. Thank you. [hangs up] That was easy! I just have to go to their office and they'll help me figure out how to get back at my parents!
Butters
[rises on his knees] Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
Stan
Fine, then you can come with me. [heads out the door]
Butters
Hooray! [follows him out] And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
South Park, commercial district. Stan and Butters run down the street and turn the corner into an alley. Stan checks the address.
Stan
I guess this is it.
Parental Revenge Center of Western America. The headquarters are quite shabby. What looks like computers and monitors are just cardboard boxes with crude drawings on them. Stan and Butters enter. They look around as they approach the main desk.
Stan
Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
Cartman
[an egg-shaped chair is seen, with its back to the boys] Yes, come in, please. [the chair turns around, and Cartman appears seated on it.]
Stan
Cartman??
Cartman
Oh, Stan, Butters, I didn't know it was you guys.
Stan
What the hell are you doing here?!
Cartman
I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
Butters
You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
Stan
God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. [both boys turn and walk towards the door]
Cartman
Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then? [Stan and Butters stop in their tracks] Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
Stan
[turns around] Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
Cartman
That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.
Stan
How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
Cartman
Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. [Stan and Butters think a moment, then take seats before Cartman]
Stan
Our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves! It was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol.
Cartman
[lets out a heavy sigh] God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
Butters
Yeah!
Cartman
Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.
Stan
How much is this going to cost us?
Cartman
Eighteen thousand dollars. [Butters looks to Stan for guidance] How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five. [Stan still looks angry, Butters follows] How about five bucks?
Motivation Corp., day.
Director
So, everything is working out with your future actor? Your son seems to be responding.
Randy
I think he's pretty scared alright.
Sharon
It's just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this.
Director
Well, you know what us ultra-liberals say, when it comes to children and drugs, lies are OK. The ends justify the means. We'll take smoking, for instance. The truth is there's no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but, we believe it's okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking.
Sharon
Well that makes sense.
Director
So it is with everything here at Motivation Corp. It's okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism. [a shot of a marijuana leaf superimposed over the burning World Trade Center] Or that... one pill of Ecstasy is gonna kill them. It's not necessarily true, but the ends justify the means.
Randy
Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
Parental Revenge Center of Western America. Cartman prepares to lay out his plans for Stan and Butters. His cap is gone, as is the egg-shell chair.
Cartman
Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here. [displays a few brochures and opens one] What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
Butters
Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
Cartman
Now, I want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches. [displays some swatches with poop samples on them]
Butters
Poop- poop swatches?
Cartman
Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
Butters
Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?
Cartman
Now, personally, I like the baby green. [switches to a new swatch] But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
Butters
Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
Cartman
Well, y-you know what we could do, uh, uh Butters, is go with the baby green in the living room, and then maybe a classic brown, or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents' bedroom.
Butters
Well that sounds good.
Cartman
Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
Butters
Hooray!
Cartman
Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
Stan
[brightly] Yeah.
Cartman
The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
Stan
Yeah.
Cartman
Your parents will drive all the way out to the school discovering that no meeting is actually taking place.
Stan
Yeah!
Cartman
And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. [Stan's excitement vanishes]
Butters
Wow! Neato!
Stan
That's not neato, that sucks.
Cartman
What?
Stan
You're gonna smear Butters' parent's walls with poop. I thought each revenge was unique and customized!
Cartman
Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
Stan
Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have to admit that they lied to me!
Cartman
Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations. [throws the brochure away and gets some paper from inside the desk] Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog.
Stan
Dude!
Cartman
Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
Stan
No, that's too extreme!
Cartman
[sighs] Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
Stan
Just forget it, Cartman! You don't know what you're doing! [leaves his seat and heads for the door.]
Cartman
I am a professional, suh! [watches Stan leave] Don't worry, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.
The Marsh house, day. All the Marshes are at the dining room table eating tacos and chips.
Stan
Hey future self.
Future Stan
Yes, former self?
Stan
You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hole in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about? [future Stan looks at Stan as if the boy were crazy] You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
Future Stan
Oh, uh...
Stan
You must know what I'm talking about.
Future Stan
Sure uh, uh, [quickly rises from the table and walks toward the dining room entrance] oh man, could you all excuse me for a second? I think I'm gonna crap my pants. [leaves. Stan crosses his arms, quite annoyed]
Sharon
Uh, Stan, [Randy stops eating his taco and looks at Stan] don't you think you're upsetting your future self a little?
Randy
Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.
Stan
Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. [Sharon and Randy shift in their chairs]
Randy
Oh. You. You don't?
Stan
No. [plants his hands along the table's edge] You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax! [crosses his arms again] And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me! [uncrosses his arms] See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
Randy
Well, you know what I think, Stan?
Stan
What?
Randy
I think he IS from the future.
Sharon
Yeah, he must be. [Stan looks at them with eyebrows knitting] It's like, I just feel he's our son, you know?
Randy
Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get rid of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
Sharon
Right. [Stan looks at them with anger, then looks forward with anger]
Butters' house, day. There's a Hispanic crew in the house painting the walls with two kinds of poop colors. The furniture is covered. Cartman enters and walks around the living room.
Cartman
Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe! [a painter descends from the small ladder he's on] The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!
Felipe
¿Qué? ¿La caca no esta aquí? ["What? The poop isn't here?"]
Cartman
¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!
Felipe
¡Sí, sí señor! ["Yes, yes sir!"]
Cartman
Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú? [looks in another part of the living room] ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we [sees a sponge on the floor and picks it up] spackle with the sponge. [dips the sponge into a poop tray and spackles the wall with it] See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.
Carlos
Sí. Marrado. ["Yes. Gently"]
Cartman
Marrado. Spectacularrr.
Carlos
Sí. [takes the sponge from Cartman and begins spackling]
Cartman
God, it's so hard to find good help. [runs into Butters, who has just entered the house] Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
Butters
Boy, it sure is stinky in here!
Cartman
Yearh, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden, Butters. But I think it's coming together real nice.
Butters
Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
Cartman
Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I? [notices another worker] ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!
The Marsh house, night. Randy and Sharon talk with the future Stan.
Future Stan
Yes, well, it's hard to find work in commercials, so I ended up- [the front door opens]
Randy
Oh, Stan! [Sharon and Future Stan look. Stan enters the dining room]
Future Stan
Oh, dude, how's it goin', man? Ey, you wanna go upstairs and play hide and go seek?
Stan
[takes a seat at the table] Hide and go seek, huh?!
Randy
Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?
Stan
I don't believe that he's my future self!
Randy
Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
Stan
No, I actually have a way to be sure. [whips out a meat cleaver in his right hand and places his left wrist on the table] I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
Sharon
[rises frantically] S-stanley you don't need to do that. He-he is your future self.
Stan
But I have to know for sure. [readies the cleaver]
Randy
[stammers] Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. [Sharon is fearful]
Stan
Maybe it's the hand I smoked that first joint with. Here I go. I'm gonna do it.
Randy
Stan...
Stan
Yes?
Randy
Uh... nothing. Go ahead.
Sharon
Randy!
Stan
[lowers the cleaver onto his wrist. The left hand falls away, and he lifts his left arm] AAAH! [a red area marks where the left hand was]
Sharon
[Low-Pitched Scream, Shrieks Loudly] AAAHHH!
Randy
Oh my God! Look! [points. Stan looks behind his seat. Randy moves quickly to Future Stan and chops off his left hand. Blood spurts out. Stan faces the adults again as Future Stan screams in pain] What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
Future Stan
Oh, Jesus Christ! Help me!
Stan
That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
Randy
Uh.. [tries to put Future Stan's back in place] Look, it was fake in the future, too. [Future Stan passes out in shock]
Sharon
Looks like you'd better really watch out for marijuana, huh Stan?
Butters' house. Cartman stands with his crew behind him, their work finished.
Cartman
Well Butters, I hope you like the work. I'm sure your parents will be plenty pissed off.
Butters
Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
Cartman
Ooo, ah, that's a different company. [the doorbell rings] Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!
Butters
Uh but Cartman! Wait! [once Cartman and crew leave, Butters faces the front door] Oh Christmas! [the door opens and Stan enters]
Stan
Butters!
Butters
Oh, Stan!
Stan
Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
Butters
Yeah, well, three hundred gallons of poop isn't gonna smell like a garden.
Stan
Butters, we're running away!
Butters
We are?
Stan
Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! [Stephen, Linda, and future Butters enter with groceries]
Stephen
What the hell is this?!
Linda
Oh my God, our house!
Butters
[squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face in his hands] Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now.
Stephen
[both parents approach with hands on hips] Butters! Do you have an explanation for this?!
Butters
Oh, not really sir, I just uh...
Linda
Wait a minute. Chris, don't you see? This might be our fault.
Stephen
What, uh-? My God. You're right, Linda. This is what we get for deceiving our son.
Stan
[watching his words fall apart] Huh?
Stephen
Butters, listen. The whole future self thing, well, it was a dirty fib.
Linda
We just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of ...telling you the truth.
Stephen
We thought the ends justified the means, but they don't. They just... don't, son! [starts crying as he and Linda hug Butters]
Linda
We're sorry, baby. [starts crying also. Butters, feeling the love, smiles, then grins.]
Stan
Get the fuck out of here. [Randy and Sharon rush into the house]
Randy
Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.
Sharon
Yes, well, eh you see, son, the time matrix pulled in more people from the future.
Stan
Aw, stop it, you guys! I know all about Motivation Corp.! All I've been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me!
Randy
Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.
Stan
I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
Randy
Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorists, but... Well son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.
Stan
I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
Sharon
He's right. If we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs, then they're never gonna believe anything we tell them.
Randy
Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
Outside Motivation Corp., day. Randy, Sharon, Stan, and Cartman look at the building and listen at the voices coming out of it.
Director
Oh God, who smeared crap all over our walls?! Oh Jesus, it smells! Oh!
Randy
You really did a nice job, Eric. [Sharon holds a box of cookies]
Stan
Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through.
Cartman
Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
Sharon
Well here, Eric, I cooked you a huge box of cookies as a present.
Cartman
Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.
Future Cartman
[Future Cartman walks into the scene. His appearance is tall, fit, clean, handsome, and wearing a suit] Atta boy, Eric. You've made the right choice.
Cartman
Who the hell are you?
Future Cartman
Haha, it's me, Cartman! You from the future. [genuflects] I came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around. You stop eating junk food and you start studying harder, you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become CEO of your own time-travel company!
Cartman
[sets the box of cookies down] Oh wow, really? That's so awesome! Now I'll really work to be successful!
Future Cartman
Right on!
Cartman
Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want! [The Marshes leave. He joins them] Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
Future Cartman
No, wait! [flashes of electricity runs through his body. His form becomes obese, dirty, and disheveled. His suit becomes an dirty open blue shirt over a dirty white shirt with a name tag. He also holds a tool box and a wrench] Oh, God-damnit!
End of My Future Self n' Me

Red Sleigh Down
Cartman's house, day. In his room, Cartman has Kyle's cousin, Kyle Schwartz, tally up his good and bad deeds to see where he will end up this year. Kyle Schwartz is seated at Cartman's desk with piles of paper to go through and an adding machine to keep it all current.
Kyle Schwartz
Ah-a-a-alright, I'm done.
Cartman
You're done?
Kyle Schwartz
Ye-yes, I-I've tallied up all the times you've been naughty and deducted the times you've been nice.
Cartman
Yeah, so how's it look?
Kyle Schwartz
It doesn't look good, Eric. It doesn't look good.
Cartman
But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
Kyle Schwartz
A-a-aactually it looks like this year you're gonna owe Santa three hundred and six presents.
Cartman
What?!
Kyle Schwartz
Four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice, is, is bad.
Cartman
Three?? You didn't deduct all my nice invoices! Look look! What about this one? [lifts up a sheet from the desk]
Kyle Schwartz
Yes, wa-a-I didn't think "hitting Clyde in the balls with slingshot" really counted as nice.
Cartman
It was nice for Token; he laughed for like 20 minutes.
Kyle Schwartz
Ye you can't deduct things like that, Eric. Santa will know and then he'll come after you.
Cartman
[lunges at Kyle Schwartz and grabs him by the left arm] God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
Kyle Schwartz
Hey hey, [Cartman lets go] I'm just your naughty-and-nice accountant! Don't blame me for the numbers!
Cartman
Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
Kyle Schwartz
But what, look, aren't there any other nice things you've done recently we can write off here?
Cartman
[thinks a minute] Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
Kyle Schwartz
Eh... brushing your teeth isn't naughty or nice... Eric, it just, it falls more into the category of... brushing your teeth.
Cartman
Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
Kyle Schwartz
If you cured cancer... and AIDS next week, you would still owe two presents.
Cartman
Jesus Christ!
Kyle Schwartz
Ah I'm afraid you're gonna have to find a way to do... the nicest, greaatest thing anyone has ever done. Ever. [sets his glasses right]
South Park city hall, outside, night. A decorated Christmas tree stands at one side of the entrance as the Mayor stands at the dais.
Mayor McDaniels
Good evening, everyone. In a moment we'll be lighting the South Park Christmas Tree to kick off the holidays!
Townsfolk
Hooray!! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree! [Everyone in town is there, and some out of towners too. Seen in the crowd are Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, Shelly, Mr. Mackey, Principal Victoria, Chef and his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Broflovski, Skeeter, Dr. Mephesto and Kevin, a Visitor, Fr. Maxi, Big-Gay Al, Mr. Adler, The Thompsons, a freak, Lolly, Mr. and Mrs. McCormick, and Kevin McCormick] Christmas Tree!
Cartman
[walks up to Stan and Kyle, who are holding candy canes] Hi guys! ["Christmas Tree!" Cartman is feeling quite cheerful. He hugs both Stan and Kyle] A very Merry Christmas to you. God bless us, everyone! [he lets go]
Kyle
[naturally weary of Cartman's cheer] What are you doing, Cartman?
Cartman
I'm just letting you guys know how special you are to me.
Mayor McDaniels
But now, before we light the tree, I think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us. [That gets the boys' attention] Right now in Iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country. The threat of war touches us all, but over in Iraq, there is no Christmas. They have nothing.
Jimbo
[to Ned] Ah I hate when the Mayor uses Christmas for her own political agenda. [uses his hands to make a megaphone and yells] Light the damn tree!
Townsfolk
YEAH! Christmas Tree! Christmas Tree!
Cartman
Oh my God, that's it!
Kyle
What's it?
Cartman
Don't you see? This time of year we should be bringing Christmas to the less fortunates! Follow me! [leaves in high spirits, then returns] You guys, come on! Right now! [Stan and Kyle shrug, then follow Cartman.]
Mayor McDaniels
Ahalright, here to light the Christmas Tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of Christmas. Jimmy. [aide 2 sets up a small mic for Jimmy to sing into. The crowd cheers as Jimmy approaches the mic.]
Jimmy
Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick.
Townsfolk
[sympathizing] Awww.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, we'd love a Christmas song, wouldn't we, folks?
Townsfolk
Christmas songs! Christmas songs! Christmas songs!
Jimmy
Alright, h-here it goes. On the first day of C-...c...c.. chrih.. stmas my tr... t-tru-true love g-geh... g-g-geh... gave... to... m..m-m-m...m-mm-m-m... me... a pa... a pa... pah...
Mr. Garrison
Oh no. [Mr. Slave, dressed in Santa bondage suit, stands next to him]
Cartman's house, night. Cartman is rushing out of his house with all sorts of presents. Stan and Kyle just stand there looking at him run around.
Cartman
[breathlessly, comes out with the box and sets it down near the driveway] ...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore. [rushes back inside] And here! Here's some Christmas cookies! [comes out with the box of cookies and sets it down] And some holly and mistletoe! [rushes in to get it, then comes out with the box, setting it next to the box of toys] Oh, this'll be the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
Stan
Cartman, why are you doing this?
Cartman
They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
Kyle
That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
A Voice
[the boys look up and to their right] Hoooowwwwdy ho! [Mr. Hankey skips into view, from a house rooftop, to a garage rooftop, to hovering in front of the boys. Magic dust accompanies him]
Kyle
Mr. Hankey! [an instrumental of Mr. Hankey's theme song plays]
Cartman
[annoyed, softly] Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo. [in normal voice] Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
Mr. Hankey
Gee whiz, things sure look Christmasy out here. What are you boys doin'?
Kyle
Cartman is trying to bring Christmas to Iraq.
Cartman
The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
Mr. Hankey
Well, gosh, Eric, looks like you really have the Christmas spirit! [Cartman bounces around joyously] I know someone who can help. Santa Claus!
Cartman
Really?
Stan, Kyle
Really?
Mr. Hankey
Sure. We should take this stuff to him right away!
Kyle
But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
Mr. Hankey
Oh, that's no problem! We just need a little Christmas magic. [raises his little arms and stirs up some magic dust. He unleashes it on a manhole cover in the middle of the street, which begins to rumble. The sewer underneath the manhole cover bubbles up and blows the cover off, and the poo spread and swirls around. A small tornado moves from side to side, then clears away, revealing a small train made of poo.] All aboard the Poo Choo Express!
Cartman
Wow!
Stan
Wuh, that smells. [lifts the front of his jacket over his nose]
Kyle
Yeah. [does the same]
Mr. Hankey
Next stop, the North Pole!
Cartman
[grabs the box of holly and mistletoe and heads for the train] Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
Stan
Uh, I don't really wanna get on there. [Cartman stops]
Kyle
Me neither.
Cartman
You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunates! [moves on] Now come on!
Mr. Hankey
Let's go, Poo Choo Train! [pulls on the whistle cord]
Whistle
Poo Choo! [the trains lurches forward and leaves a train of poo behind. Soon it's running smoothly]
Mr. Hankey
Poo Choo Train's layin' down its tracks with a
Whistle
Poo Choo!
Mr. Hankey
All the way and back!
Cartman
Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
Kyle
Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
Stan
I don't know.
Mr. Hankey
Christmastime wouldn't be the same without hugs and kisses and a Poo Choo Train. [from a view in space, the train is seen making its way to the North Pole]
South Park. Jimmy is still singing.
Jimmy
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...
The North Pole. The Poo Choo Train pulls into view, then stops.
Mr. Hankey
Here we are, kids. The North Pole. [Stan and Kyle run off the train and put some distance between it and themselves]
Stan
Awww! [both of them release their breath and start coughing]
Kyle
Finally!
Stan
God, it took forever!
Cartman
Wow, is that where Santa lives?
Mr. Hankey
That's it. Santa's Fortress of Solitude. [The fortress is shown in all its icy glory. The boys and Mr. Hankey head for the entrance. Two icy door slide apart and a gnome appears]
Gnome 1
Mr. Hankey!
Mr. Hankey
We need to see Santa right away on urgent Christmas business.
Gnome 1
Sure thing!
The workshop. The group enters. Gnomes are busy everywhere, moving gifts around, decorating Christmas trees.
Kyle
Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
Gnome 1
Ten months out of the year. But this time of year we help Santa! [leads the group out of the workshop] Here he is! [the group comes across Santa at his desk reading a list of names]
Santa
[turns around] Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas!
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
[impressed] Wow!
Mr. Hankey
Howdy ho, Santa!
Santa
[with open arms, approaches] Mr. Hankey, how are you?
Mr. Hankey
All ready for Christmas?
Santa
I was just starting to look over the new naughty and nice list the gnomes prepared for me.
Cartman
Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
Santa
Oh no, they keep it open until midnight of Christmas Eve. Some kids actually try to cram in a lot of niceness right at the end.
Cartman
[brushes it off] Oh, that's so lame of them. [Stan looks at him]
Mr. Hankey
Santa, my friends are trying to do something very special this Christmas. Tell him, Eric.
Cartman
[with hands behind his back] Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.
Santa
You know you're right. Santa hasn't been to that of the world in a looong time. Perhaps Santa could bring peace to this whole situation.
Cartman
That's what I thought.
Santa
Gnomes! [the gnomes gather around him] Load up the sleigh with toys! Santa's going to make a special run!
Mr. Hankey
All right!
Santa
And you boys can all watch me from our flight control room.
Cartman
Hooray!
South Park. Jimmy is still singing.
Jimmy
...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee...
The North Pole Flight Control Room. The gnomes and boys enter the room, which is fully decorated in Christmas cheer.
Gnome 1
This is Santa's flight control center. From here, we can monitor Santa from satellite as he travels the globe delivering presents.
Kyle
Wow, cool!
Mr. Hankey
Hey, it looks like Santa has already made it to Baghdad. [four camera angles show Santa arriving in Baghdad: two side angles, one overhead, one front]
Baghdad, Iraq. Santa sails over the city.
Santa
Ho ho hoo! Merry Christmas, everyone! [the Iraqi adults stop and look up. Two presents drop down before a house, the door opens, and two kids look at the gifts with saucer eyes. They come out and pick up the gifts, grinning brightly. They glance up at Santa, then look back at their gifts] Ho ho hoo! A Merry Christmas to all!
Iraqi Man 1
[black beard] Paka klakalaka.
Iraqi Man 2
[white beard] Anah kakadakadaka.
Santa
Merry Christmas! [An Iraqi man shows up with a shoulder-mounted bazooka, aims at Santa, and fires the rocket. The sleigh is hit and Santa loses control of it.] I'm hit! I'm hit! [switch to North Pole]
Gnome 1
Sleigh is hit! I repeat! Sleigh is hit! [switch to Baghdad]
Gnome 2
Ultimate failure at o-sixhundred feet! [the sleigh swings around violently, tossing Santa off. Santa holds on to one of the skids]
Santa
Hold on! [climbs up to the sleigh cab] Sleigh is going down! [switch to North Pole]
Gnome 1
Sleigh is going down! I repeat! Sleigh is going down!
Stan
Hang on, Santa! [switch to Baghdad]
Gnome 3
[heard on the sleigh's radio] Sleigh 1 is going down! We are going down! [more chatter is heard as the sleigh heads for a crash landing. The sleigh strikes the edge of a building's rooftop and knocks away some of the façade]
Gnome 4
[on the sleigh's radio] Don't look down! Don't look down! Repeat! Don't look down! [the sleigh crashes and everyone who's on the ground looks for a place to hide. Presents are spilled all over. The area is soon empty save for Santa and the sleigh. Color vanishes. Switch to North Pole]
Gnome 1
[on the sleigh's radio] We got a red sleigh down. We got a red sleigh down. [Arabic music is heard as the boys look at the devastation] Red Sleigh 1, this is North Pole. [no response. The boys are in shock] Red Sleigh 1, this is North Pole. [no response] Mr. Kringle? [after a moment, turns around]
Gnome 5
Jesus Christ, they killed him!
Cartman
No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
Stan
Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
Mr. Hankey
It certainly doesn't seem very Christmasy of them.
Santa
[over the radio] North Pole. This is Santa.
Mr. Hankey
Santa! Are you alright?
Gnome 2
What is your status?
Santa
[on screen] Sleigh is down. Reindeer... all dead. Both Santa's legs are broken. Santa's... very sad. Santa will have to... oh no. They're coming for me! [the other gnomes begin to stream into the control room] Stay back, you bastards! Stay back! [the communications link is lost]
Stan
Oh no.
Cartman
Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
Gnome 5
What the hell are we supposed to do?! We're like nine inches tall!
Cartman
[blubbering] Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
Kyle
Is that what this is all about?! [Stan shoots a quizzical stare] You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! [Stan is angry now]
Cartman
It's not stupid! It's a toy that you can starve! If you don't feed it, it dies. It's sooo cool.
Stan
Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
Cartman
Oh, Christ.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
[gasp] Jesus!
Mr. Hankey
Hey, that's right. Jesus can save anybody.
Gnome 2
Follow me. You can take Santa's backup sleigh. [walks off. Mr. Hankey, the other gnomes, and the boys follow him]
South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas.
Jimmy
On the fifth... day... day of... Christmas, [the townsfolk have begun to fall asleep] ...my t-true love gave to... uh... me. Five g-g-g... golden ruh-ring... rings. [one of the mayor's aides falls asleep on her shoulder] Fuhgom... don... t-t... don... four cal...ling buh-irr...
The North Pole, Fortress of Solitude.
Gnome 2
We fed Jesus Christ's data into the autopilot. This sleigh should be able to take you right to him.
Stan
I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
Gnome 2
Here it is. Red Sleigh 2. [shown with its own team of reindeer]
Cartman
Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
Mr. Hankey
Tell Santa's workers to keep making toys. We'll have Santa back in no time!
Kyle
Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
Gnome 2
You just have to call out the reindeer's names.
Cartman
Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
Gnome 2
No, no, they're all dead. You have to call out the new ones. [each reindeer is highlighted as its name is called] On Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. [the reindeer move forward and the sleigh soon rises into the sky] Good luck finding Jesus! [waves goodbye after them]
The night sky. The boys sail along the winds.
Cartman
Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
Mr. Hankey
We should be able to find Jesus in no time!
Cartman
I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
Kyle
What are you doing?
Cartman
[looks at Kyle, then lowers his eyelids a bit] I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
Kyle
Singing a Christmas song isn't gonna get you nice deductions, Cartman! Don't forget: it's because of you that Santa's sleigh got shot down!
Cartman
[draws close to Kyle] Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
Kyle
All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
Cartman
[resumes his position in back of the sleigh and speeds up his song] It's Christmas magic time, inside the sleigh, so high in the sky, eh with candy canes and chimney smiles, eh...
South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas. The townsfolk get sleepier.
Jimmy
Six geese are laying... fu...five go-oldenh ...uhrings. Fodom... dom... du...du...t...du... Four calling biiirds...
Baghdad. Santa is being hauled down a hall by three Iraqi soldiers. He's got bruises here and there, a bloody nose, a black eye. They enter a room.
Santa
Where are you taking me?? [one soldier seems to order the other two to strap Santa into a chair] You are all being very naughty. [a general enters]
Iraqi General
[soft-spoken] Why you come to Iraq, my main man?
Santa
[a soldier ladles some water onto Santa] To bring happiness and joy to the children.
Iraqi General
And this is...? [carries a toy train and dangles a car in front of Santa] This is what you think brings happy? [walks behind Santa] This is material... [thrusts the toy train at Santa over the shoulder] This is commercialism! Your country is sick. Sick! [throws the toy train onto Santa's body and walks away]
Santa
No, your country has just lost all its Christmas spirit. [a soldier approaches and opens Santa's pants.] What's going on here?!
Iraqi General
America wants to bomb my house, my main man. They want to kill my wife and children. We need to know... what is their plan?
Santa
I don't know, I live in the North Pole. [the general leaves, then soon returns with two rods attached to cables. A soldier cranks up the device they're connected to] What are you doing??
Iraqi General
They say that the Chinese were the first to experiment with an electroshock to the testicles.
Santa
Oh no. Not Santa's balls! [The general descends on Santa's balls and makes them glow. This part is not shown, save for a shot of Santa's back and a glow coming from the front side. A few seconds later the general removes the rods and rises, and the glow fades. Santa coughs]
Iraqi General
What else is America planning?!
Santa
[coughs some more, spits, and faces the general] I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Iraqi General
You're not in a position to kill anyone, my main man! I just want you to tell me America's plan!
Santa
Then we're in for a long night, because I don't know shit! [the general glances at the soldier, who ratchets the charger up higher. Santa screams in pain]
An Italian church. Jesus stands at the altar receiving parishioners, blessing them for one thing or another.
Jesus
[blessing an elderly man with a few drops of wine] In nome del mio padre, siete guarito. ["In the name of my Father, you are healed."]
Elderly Man
[as he is led away] Benedicali! Benedicali! ["Bless you! Bless you!"]
Woman
Jesus, mio bambino no puoi sentirsi. ["Jesus, my son can't feel himself." (he's numb)]
Jesus
[blesses the infant] Il vostro bambino se arguisto. ["Your son ..."]
Woman
Bene, Benedicali! ["Bless, bless you!" The boys' voices are now heard inside the church and the congregants look around. The sleigh crashes though a window and glass showers down over Jesus and the other people present] La morte rossa! ["The red death!" The sleigh alights and stops]
Mr. Hankey
Hooowdy ho! [the churchgoers panic and run out of the church.]
Cartman
Jesus!
Jesus
Stan, Kyle, Mr. Hankey and Eric Cartman. What are you doing here, my children?
Stan
Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
Jesus
Santa? Is he alright?
Kyle
We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
Jesus
We have to get him out of there.
Mr. Hankey
Do you know a way?
Jesus
Yes. Yes, I think I do. [approaches an ornate cabinet] We need a little Christmas miracle. [slides the door open to reveal an armory. He starts taking out an Uzi] Lock and load! We're goin' in!
South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas. The townsfolk get sleepier.
Jimmy
On the s...seventh day of Christmas my t...true love...
The interrogation room. The general continues shock treatment on Santa's balls.
Iraqi General
You're a sick capitalist dog, my main man! [jabs the balls again, and Santa howls in pain]
Baghdad. Jesus, Mr. Hankey, and the boys arrive and sail over the city.
Cartman
This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole! [Jesus looks over, Cartman notices] I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
Gnome
Red Sleigh 2, come in.
Stan
We're here.
Gnome
You're coming up on the source of the signal. You're right on top of him!
Jesus
He must be in that building below us. Land it on the roof, Mr. Hankey.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy ho, Jesus. [the sleigh lands and a rooftop door opens.]
Soldier 1
[clean-shaven] Gankueda!
Jesus
[steps off the sleigh and holds his arms up] Wait here, I can handle this.
Soldier 2
[bearded] Kinkeda? Kinkakueda!
Jesus
Yay, look upon me, and know me.
Soldier 1
Halak balah!
Soldier 2
Kli malah!
Jesus
My children, you should know something. [a dagger shoots out and gets into position by his left arm] I'm packing. [quickly jabs the clean-shaven soldier in the throat, and the soldier gags to death. A gun with silencer descends along Jesus' right arm. He takes that and quickly kills the bearded soldier. He calls out to the others on the sleigh] Let's go! [Mr. Hankey and the boys leave the sleigh]
Cartman
This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas. The townsfolk get sleepier.
Jimmy
On the el- el- el- eleventh day of C- Christmas my t...true love gave to me, e-eleven p-p-pipers p-pu-p-piping...
The interrogation room. The general is now making Santa swallow a can of oil.
Iraqi General
Drink it! Drink the oil! This is all you Western capitalists want! [Jesus bursts through the door.]
Santa
Jesus Christ! [Jesus kills the soldier at the charging station, then the other soldier. The general holds up his hands. Jesus shoots him on the left know and he falls.]
Iraqi General
Ach!
Santa
Oh! Thank! Thank God for you, Jesus! [Jesus walks up to Santa and unties him]
Jesus
Here. [hands him a gun] Can you walk?
Santa
Santa's legs are broken. [Jesus moves his hands over them, then steps back]
Jesus
They are healed. [walks off. Santa follows, but turns around to face the general, who is cowering now. Santa fixes his gaze on the general and aims the gun. After a few intense moments Santa moves the gun off and fires twice. Jesus comes up behind Santa] Santa...
Santa
I just couldn't do it. [Santa didn't miss after all. The general got one bullet to the brain, another one that split his head open] I just couldn't let him live. He shocked Santa's balls! [sirens go off]
Mr. Hankey
More soldiers are coming!
Jesus
Let's move. Move!
South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas.
Jimmy
Eight... maids are... milking...
A hallway. Jesus leads the others out.
Jesus
[stops at the foot of a stairway and turns around] Get up the stairs! The sleigh is on the roof! [a soldier comes down the stairs]
Kyle
Jesus, behind you! [Jesus looks at the boys. The soldier shoots Jesus in the back]
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
[in slow motion] Jesus! [in slow motion, Jesus wobbles a bit and then falls]
Santa
[in slow motion] No! [fires away with his gun, killing the soldier. He then approaches Jesus and holds him] Jesus. Jesus! [Jesus stammers, but nothing comes out of his mouth] No... don't worry, Jesus, it's nothing. It's just a scratch.
Jesus
You're a... bad liar. [the boys are speechless] Hey. B-but we sure gave them one hell of a fight, huh?
Santa
We sure did, Jesus.
Stan
[finding his voice] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Jesus
Uh Santa?
Santa
[quickly answers] I'm here, Jesus.
Jesus
Don't... don't ever... let them take away... our... Christmas spirit. [Jesus takes his last breath and expires. His halo disappears]
Stan
Oh my God. Iraqis killed Jesus.
Kyle
You bastards. [behind them, soldiers mass at the other end of the hall]
Santa
[with a gun on each arm] Come on, kids! [turns around and rushes up the stairs. The kids follow]
The building's rooftop. Santa leads the boys out while firing at the pursuing Iraqi soldiers.
Santa
Get to the sleigh! Get to the sleigh! [the boys run by screaming as Santa mows the soldiers down with both semiautomatics. More soldiers pour out, more bodies pile up. The boys sit down in the sleigh, and Stan and Kyle take the reins]
Mr. Hankey
Start the sleigh!
Stan
Uh, on Steven, on Fluffy, on Horace, on Chantel. Uhh...
Kyle
On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. [the sleigh begins to move forward and Santa runs out of ammo. He drops the guns and heads for the moving sleigh. He hops in and the remaining soldiers fire at the departing sleigh. The sleigh goes up and away]
Cartman
Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
Kyle
Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
Cartman
Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
Santa
You're right, kid. [turns the sleigh around]
Mr. Hankey
What are you doin', Santa?
Santa
I came to bring Christmas to Iraq and by God I'm gonna do it! [presses a button on his dashboard.]
Panels on either side of the sleigh body open up to reveal bombs and a controller rises up in front of Santa. He releases the reins and fires a rocket. It heads for a building and Iraqis move out of the way. It hits its target, but instead of destroying it, the bomb decorates the building in Christmas cheer. Strings of lights decorate the windows and a Christmas tree appears at the door. "Joy To The World" plays as snow comes down from the sky. The Iraqis approach in wonder.
Santa
Hohoho! Merry Christmas! [the sleigh sails above a street and Santa strafes the buildings on either side with more bombs. Each of the buildings is decorated with lights and Christmas trees, and presents appear under the trees. The sleigh goes down another street and bombs another building. It too is decorated]
Soldier
[directing another soldier with a bazooka ready to fire] Dakadaka!
Stan
RPG, four o'clock!
Santa activates a laser, which rises over the boys and fires at the soldier's bazooka. It becomes a giant candy cane. The soldiers are surprised. Santa fires at a group of people holding baskets of bread and a woman holding a chicken. The baskets become gifts, while the chicken becomes a large gingerbread man. A rifle in one man's hands becomes a Christmas wreath.
Mr. Hankey
Boy, things are starting to look Christmasy now!
Santa
Merry Christmas! Hohoho!
Santa makes another pass down a decorated street and drops five more bombs. They leave behind five snowmen. The Iraqis are surprised and confused by all these presents. The kids are terribly pleased with theirs.
Santa
Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night! Hohohohoho!
South Park City Hall. Jimmy is still singing Twelve Days of Christmas. The mayor's assistants are asleep and the mayor is getting sleepy.
Jimmy
And a p-p-par-tridge in a p-peeeaaar treeee. [a moment of silence follows. No more is heard from Jimmy]
Mayor McDaniels
That's it? That's it! The song's over! We can light the tree! [heads for the dais. Her aides follow. The townsfolk rouse themselves.]
Townsfolk
[cheering heartily] Hurrah! Woohoo! Yay!
Jimbo
Oh, finally!
Mayor McDaniels
Go on, Jimmy! There's only five more seconds until Christmas! [hands him the detonator by which to light the tree. The townsfolk are glad with anticipation, making fists. Jimmy lowers the trigger, the tree lights up and goes dark, and then a bulb explodes]
Townsfolk
Awwww!
Randy
Christmas is ruined again! [they begin to disperse, but jingle bells stop them in their tracks]
Santa
[heard over the jingle bells] Ho ho ho! [Santa flies over the gathering and drops a bomb on the tree. It blazes forth with bright lights]
Townsfolk
WOW!!! [cheering and applause follow. The sleigh lands and the occupants disboard]
Randy
Stan!
Sheila
Kyle!
Kyle
[runs up to his parents] Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
Stan
[runs up to his parents] We brought Christmas to Iraq!
Santa
[approaches the dais] Everyone! Everyone, can I please have your attention? [Cartman approaches his mom; they hug each other] Christmas is a very special time of year, but... this year it almost didn't happen. There's a man named Jesus who gave his life to save me. And so I declare that every year on Christmas Day, we should remember Jesus for what he did, and thank him for it. From now on, Christmas will be a day for remembering a brave man named Jesus.
Townsfolk
[cheering heartily] Hooray!
Santa
Now, if you'll all excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do. [leaves the dais]
Mr. Hankey
I'll help you, Santa!
Santa
[gets into his sleigh and looks over at the boys] Oh, and boys, you might want to check under the Christmas tree. [the boys are surprised, then happy. Stan leads them to the presents. Santa takes the sleigh off the ground and away] Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! [the boys reach their presents and check them over. For a moment they look like the Iraqi kids. Their looks change back to normal as they rip off the wrapping. They all get the same gift]
Stan
Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! [Cartman's joy vanishes]
Cartman
Oh, God-damnit!
Kyle
Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
Cartman
Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! [kicks the toy away. The camera zooms out enough for a fourth person to walk into the shot]
Stan
Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. [Kenny walks into the frame.]
Kenny
(Hey guys. What's goin' on?)
Stan
Oh, hey Kenny.
Kyle
Dude, where have you been?
Kenny
(Oh, I've just been hanging out.)
Kyle
Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. [walks away with his Haibo doll. Stan follows with his Haibo doll, and Cartman follows with an angry look]
Stan
Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
End of Red Sleigh Down

Cancelled
At the bus stop, day. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny wait. Ike hops into view
The Boys
School days, school days, teacher's golden rule day...
Kyle
Ah, damn it!
Cartman
What?
Kyle
My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
Ike
Suck my balls.
Kyle
No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. [Ike chortles]
Cartman
Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
Kyle
Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
Cartman
Alright, go home, you little semen-puking asshole dickhead! [the boys laugh, Kyle picks up Ike and swings him towards Cartman. Ike smacks Cartman in the face and Cartman falls on his back] Ow!
Stan
Dude, sweet! [Ike stands up]
Kyle
Yeah. Check it out. [sets up Ike and prepares for a kick] Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
Ike
Don't kick the goddamn baby!
Kyle
Kick it!
Ike
Waaaah-- [flies across the street and lands in some snow on the other side] Ow.
Cartman
[gets up and yawns] Uuugh.
Kyle
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Cartman
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Kyle
Really? What about?
Cartman
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed… [the dream sequence begins] in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room [his window flies open and a bright beam blinds him as he rises to see what it is]. Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open [a glow appears around the door as an alien peeks inside] and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway. [This hallway has specimens on either side of it. "Weeaak!"] Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me. [four aliens hover over him and lower his pajama pants as a robot arm nearby gets to work on his ass] And they had big heads and big black eyes…
Stan
Dude! Visitors!
Kyle
Totally!
Cartman
What?
Stan
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
Cartman
No, it was just a dream, [crosses his arms] my mom said so.
Stan
Visitors are real. They... [lowers his left eyebrow and thinks, looking down] Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
Kyle
Yeah. This does seem really familiar.
Cartman
What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
Kyle
Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
Cartman
Eh... shut up you guys, you're just tryin' to scare me.
Stan
No, dude, this happened before! Aliens put some device in you and then we tied you up to a tree and you went up on their ship! You don't remember that?
Cartman
No I don't remember that!
Kyle
You don't?
Cartman
No, because the aliens erased my memory!
Stan
I remember this whole thing. [to Kyle] Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
Kyle
Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. [the sound of wheels approaching]
Chef
[pulling up in his station wagon, steps out] Hello there, children! [silence]
Kyle
[to Stan] And then you said
Stan
What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
Chef
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with hot buttered noodles
All
and a choice of green bean salad or vegetable medley.
Kyle
Weird
Chef
Say, did any of you children
All
see the alien space ship last night?
Chef
What the?
Stan
Chef, we're in a repeat.
Chef
A repeat??
Kyle
Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
Cartman
Aw dude, I hate repeats!
Chef
[walks around and stands behind the boys] I've been feelin' Déjà vu all mornin', children. I knew somethin' strange was goin' on!
Stan
It all started when Cartman got an anal probe.
Chef
We have to get Eric to a proctologist right away.
'[South Park Medical Clinic. Inside, Chef and the boys wait on chairs as Cartman lies face down on a proctologist's table]'
Kyle
What is a proc-tologist, Chef?
Chef
He's a doctor that specializes in your asshole, children.
Stan
You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
Chef
That's right.
Kyle
What a dick!
Proctologist
[entering] Hello everyone! [walks towards Cartman]
Chef
Hello Doctor. Thanks for seein' Eric on such short notice.
Proctologist
What seems to be the problem?
Chef
We just want you to take a look and tell us if you see anything abnormal.
Kyle
Other than his monstrous size.
Cartman
[whips an angry look at him] SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! [pulls his head back and rests it on his left hand]
Proctologist
All right, let's see here. [raises the blanket and looks down] Oh my God!!
Cartman
What?
Proctologist
Why, there's a huge crack goin' right down the middle! [beat. The doctor begins to laugh]
Cartman
[displeased] Haha, very funny.
Stan
Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
Proctologist
[chuckles] All right, let's take a look. [snaps on a yellow latex glove and plunges a finger into the butthole]
Cartman
Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
Chef
Eric, the doctor has to feel inside your rectum.
Kyle
And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
Cartman
Kyle, I swear, if I didn't have a guy's hand up my ass right now, I'd leap across the room and kick you in the nuts. Eh. Oohh. Oww.
Proctologist
Well the prostate seems to be normal. No swelling of the hemorrhoidal gland...
Cartman
Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
Proctologist
Wait, what's this? [the anal probe appears once again and the doctor jumps out of the way. The probe stretches out and clears away part of the clinic on its way to full height. A large hole is left on the building as the satellite dish juts out from it.]
Kyle
Are you okay?
Cartman
[with a dreamy, relieved look] Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! [smiles]
Chef
Well, doctor?
Proctologist
[slowly] I've never quite seen this before, uh... Perhaps he just needs some hemorrhoid cream.
Cartman
[the probe collapses and sinks back into his ass] Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!
Stan
You all right?
Cartman
You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I"M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
Proctologist
I've never seen a hemorrhoid react this way.
Chef
That wasn't no hemorrhoid, it was an alien hoobajoob! Come on, children! We've got to get Eric to some real help!
Stan
Where to now, Chef?
Chef
That thing inside Eric's asshole looked like some kinda alien satellite dish. We need to see my friend down at the Space Center now! [as they leave the clinic they pass the receptionist's window. A receptionist with a weird white face and yellow hair looks on as they leave. She then removes her wig and shows that she's a Visitor.]
The space center. Lots of satellite dishes dot the premises. Inside Chef leads the children to a scientist.
Chef
And you're the only person I could think of who might be able to help us, Jeff.
Jeff
How do we uh, make it come out?
Chef
Someone just has to activate it like the proctologist did.
Cartman
[crosses his arms] Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. [grins]
Stan
What?
Kyle
No way! [looks to his left and points] You do it, Kenny!
Cartman
Nope! It has to be Kyle!
Stan
Go on.
Kyle
I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
Chef
Kyle, the fate of the world may be at stake.
Cartman
[lowers his pants and moons Kyle] Come, Kyle. Do hurry. [Kyle moves tentatively toward Cartman and bares his left arm] Go ahead, it won't bite. [Kyle raises his arm and move in. Cartman farts and Kyle angrily lowers his arm. Cartman and Kenny laugh]
Kyle
God-damnit Cartman!
Cartman
[laughing] I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]
Kyle
Stop it Cartman!
Cartman
[laughing] Okay. Okay okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kenny joins in. and Kyle angrily lowers his arm.]
Kenny
[laughing] (Gaaahaha, he got you again!)
Kyle
God Dammit!
Cartman
[laughing] Haha. Oh man, that was great. Okay, go ahead. I'm all out of farts now. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm, looking at the other guys.] Gahaaa! Derrr!
Kenny
[laughs, then echoes Cartman] (Derrr!)
Cartman
Okaay, okay. It's not funny anymore. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Oh yes it is! [swats the odor towards Kyle.]
Kenny
[laughs, then echoes Cartman] (Yes it is!)
Chef
Eric, that's enough!
Cartman
Okay, okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohh, double psych!
Kyle
That's it! [walks off] I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
Stan
Oh, nice going, Cartman!
Cartman
All right, all right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Kyle.
Kyle
No!
Cartman
No, go ahead. I'm dry.
Kyle
You're lying!
Chef
It stopped being funny forty seconds ago, boy! Let's just get this over with!
Cartman
But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
Jeff
Can I see this thing, please?
Cartman
Okay. [Kyle raises his hand and moves his finger towards the butthole. Cartman farts again and laughs. Kyle angrily lowers his arm.] Ohhh! God-dammit! [Cartman, Kenny, and Chef laugh]
Chef
Okay. Now it's funny again.
Cartman
This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
Kyle
That does it! CHARGE! [drives his finger into Cartman's butthole. Cartman farts and screams as the anal probe shoot out of his ass. The probe opens up into the satellite dish and the dish sends a beam into outer space. Part of the space center is destroyed in the process]
Chef
What's it doing?
Jeff
It, it's sending a transmission of some kind. [sits at a console and types away] Got it! [on several screen above the keyboard, images from around the planet pop up and change every second or so.]
Kyle
It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
Chef
Where is the signal being sent to? [the signal cuts off and the anal probe shrinks back into Cartman's ass. Cartman screams as it does so.]
Cartman
Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
Kyle
We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
Stan
We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
Jeff
Whoever they are, if they're receiving messages, they might be sending them, too. Wait a minute. c-candy bars.
Kyle
Candy bars?
Jeff
You-you know. Candy bars. They usually come in a wrapper. Just like you... wrap a Christmas present. Christmas happens when it's cold. Cold, as in Alaska - that's... with polar bears. Polar bears... pola... polarity! I can switch the polarity to see what transmissions are coming from the location this one is being sent to! [turns around and types away on the console. The power cuts out and the center goes dark.] What the heck? [the sound of heavy ships is heard, and two bright beams light up the room. Everyone looks towards a window. Outside, a visitor walks up and looks in through one end window. A second one looks through the other end window. The windows shatter] They're coming in! [a glow appears outside a door and permeates it. The door shuts and two visitors enter. The other two come in through the window and the four of them converge on the boys, Chef, and Jeff.]
Stan
What do we do???
Cartman
[steps forward and points to Jeff] It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
Jeff
What?? [the visitors go after Jeff, and the others make their escape]
Chef
Help!
Kyle
Aaaah! Runrunruuun! [the group makes it outside]
Stan
Let's go!
Chef
Get in the car, children! Get in the car! [they all scramble in and Chef peels away from the center. He drives down the road towards South Park. Another car appears behind then and throws up its headlights. Its horn honks a few times]
Stan
[startled] What is that?
Chef
Can you see anything, children? [Kyle looks back]
Kyle
[turns back] The aliens are chasing us! [a close-up of the four aliens in the car behind Chef. A passenger-side visitor leans out and draws a revolver, shooting at Chef. A bullet strikes the rear window and the boys jump]
Chef
God damned aliens! [the two cars move down the road with the visitors still shooting]
Stan
Chef! End of the road! [several barricades are up, with STOP signs hanging on the, and one sign saying "ROAD CLOSED"]
Chef
Hold on, children! [Cartman looks at the visitors] We have to ditch them! [steps on the gas pedal]
Cartman
What are you doing, man?! [Chef drives towards the barricade and goes up a wooden ramp, into the air.]
Narrator
[some backwoods music plays in the background in freeze-frame] Looks like them boys are gettin' a little fresh air. [the wagon lands on the other side of a pothole and continues. The visitors try the same jump, but they launch into the air and off the road, towards a chicken coop. They crash through the roof and land right in the middle of the coop. Chickens ]
Kyle
[looks out and back] I think we ditched them.
Chef
I don't think we're outta the woods yet. [they pass a sign saying "eat BIG PIG'S BBQ" with a pig in a white Southern suit. Behind the billboard, a police car pulls out and pursues Chef. There are two visitors in the car]
Visitor Driver
Coop coop.
Stan
It's the police!
Chef
That ain't no police! [for some reason, two workers are moving a large glass pane across the road. Chef heads on down and crashes through it. The police cruiser follows]
Cartman
When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
Stan
Chef!! [Chef sees yet another barricade and goes towards it, forcing the worker guarding it to jump out of the way/ Chef launches into the air once again. "Dixie" is heard from the car's horn. The aliens catch up to Chef and the boys and try the same jump. They end up upside down and unable to move. Chef spins the car a bit and looks back at the police cruiser]
Chef
[jumps out and approaches the police car] HA! God-damned aliens! I beat you! [a beam lights up the car] Where'd you learn to drive, aliens?! Chinese auto school?! [the car begins to rise slowly]
The Boys
Chef! Chef! They've got us!
Chef
You're lucky I didn't just turn around and beat your white skinny alien asses anyway! Maybe next time you'll remember to... [notices the weird sounds behind him and turns] Huh? [looks up to see the station wagon hovering near the entrance to the ship] Aw crap! Children!
The Boys
Cheeeeeeef!
Narrator
[the picture freezes] Well, it looks like the boys are in more trouble than a June bug in molasses. And it's pretty thick molasses, too.
A chamber. Stan is tied up in some green alien pod, asleep.
Stan
Uh. [stirs and opens his eyes] Wugh. You guys. Wake up! [the other boys are in pods of their own]
Kyle
[stirs in his own pod] What the? Where are, where are we?
Stan
We're in the alien ship.
Cartman
Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass! [panics] Oh God, help me you guys!
Kyle
It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
Cartman
[looks down] ...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
Stan
[out of his pod] Guys. Look. [the others get out of theirs and walk towards Stan]
Kyle, Cartman
Wow. [they face a massive window, through which they get a good view of Earth getting farther and farther away]
Stan
My God, do you guys realize? This is only the second time we've ever been in outer space.
Kyle
Yeah.
Kenny
(Awesome)
Cartman
This is like my fifth time. [the room brightens and two doors open at the other end of the room. The boys turn and face it]
Stan
Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
Kenny
(Oh no!) [tightens the hood on his face. The man enters... it appears to be Stan's father.]
Alien
Hello boys.
Stan
Dad?
Alien
No, not really. I just read your mind and thought this form might be more pleasing to you.
Kyle
Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.
Stan
Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.
Cartman
Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
Alien
Very well, I shall show my true form. [a quick transformation into a hideous monster] Rah rah rah rah rah. Rah rah rah rah.
The Boys
[shielding their eyes] AAAAH!
Stan
Okay okay, take the form of something else!
Alien
[transforms again] How's this? [the boys move their arms off their eyes to behold Santa]
Cartman
Santa!
Stan
Nno, that's stupid too. [Cartman looks at Stan, deflated]
Alien
How about this? [transforms into Michael Jordan, Bulls form]
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
No. [the alien turns into Don King] No! [then into Mr. Roarke and Tattoo]
Cartman
[impressed] Oooo, very nice.
Stan
No! [the alien turns into George Burns]
Kyle
No! [the alien turns into J.J. Walker]
Alien
Dy-no-mite!
The Boys
No!
Back at the space center, day. Jeff is cleaning up after the destruction left behind by the visitors
Chef
[with flashlight] Jeff!! The aliens took the children up on their ship.
Jeff
Oh no!
Chef
Did you find out what the aliens were up to?
Jeff
When I reversed the polarities, I found this: [sits at the console and starts pressing keys. 1s and 0s flash across a screen] It's a message that the aliens are broadcasting throughout the entire universe. But I have no idea what it says.
Chef
They took the children, Jeff! I have to know what those aliens are up to!
Jeff
[spins around] Wait a minute! Butt sex!
Chef
Butt sex?
Jeff
Butt sex requires a lot of lubrication, right? Lubrication. Lubruh... Chupuh... Chupacabra's the, the goat killer of Mexican folklore. Folklore is stories from the past that are often fictionalized. Fictionalized to heighten drama. Drama students! Students at colleges usually have bicycles! Bi, bian, binary. It's binary code! [spins back and works on decoding it]
Chef
Who's havin' butt sex?
Back on the alien ship
Alien
[prances as Saddam] Hello my honey, hello my baby, hello my ragtime gal! [ends on his knees, arms wide open]
The Boys
[getting bored] No!
Alien
[transforms into Missy Elliot] Lemme search ya, gonna work ya, hepsunudupunubuh huh.
The Boys
No! [Stan is irritated]
Alien
[transforms into Frank Sinatra] Don't piss on the moon, babe.
The Boys
NO!
Alien
All right, earthlings, what form do you want me to take? [the boys fall silent]
Cartman
How about a taco, that craps ice cream? [the alien transforms into the taco. A wad of ice cream falls out of him] Guys?
Stan
I like it.
Kenny
(Me too.) [the boys clap]
Alien
All right, then we can get back to business. Follow me this way, earthlings. [leads the boys into another room, leaving scoops of ice cream behind, in various flavors] I want to apologize to you boys for all the spooky, scary stuff. We just needed to get to the malfunctioning uplink relay.
Stan
You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?
Alien
That's right. See, there are dishes in over fifty thousand earthlings' rectums. Your friend's has been malfunctioning.
Kyle
Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
Alien
Oh, heavens no! We're a production company. We make intergalactic television programs that the whole universe watches. [enters the next room]
Stan
[looks back at his friends] Television? [the boys enter the next room. In that room visitors are all over the place manning the various aspects of a production company]
Alien
We at Nerzod Productions started twenty billion years ago with one philosophy: the best universal television isn't scripted, it's real. [Stan and Kyle look at each other] We started with great shows like, "Who Wants To Marry A Gelgamek?" and "Antares 6 Millionaire". And then we had a big hit with "Get Me Outta Here, I'm a Klingnanian". But then of course, there's our signature show. The greatest universal reality show of all time. [he looks at a giant screen on which Earth is shown]
Kyle
Earth?
Alien
A few billion years ago we realized, "what if we took species from all different planets in the universe, and put them together, on the same planet?" Great TV, right? Asians, bears, ducks, Jews, deer and Hispanics, all trying to live side by side on one planet! It's great! [the boys are stunned at what they're hearing]
Stan
Our planet is just a reality-TV show?
Alien
Well, you don't think the whole universe works the way Earth does, do you? No! One species, one planet! There's a planet of deer, a planet of Asians, and so on! We put them all together on Earth and the whole universe tunes in to watch the fun!
Kyle
You mean that you aliens actually enjoy sitting around and watching us fight and kill each other? Dude, that's messed up.
Alien
Why?
Stan
Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
Cartman
Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! [the boys just look at each other]
The Convention Center, day.
Jeff
Ladies and Gentleman, we have recently come across an alien transmission that is being beamed throughout the entire universe. [murmurs rise up in the audience] When decoded, it looks like this. [he begins the transmission and graphics sweep by. First, the binary code appears, then a dazzling sun behind the Earth, then a tracking shot leading to Earth, then an undernourished boy, then a caravan walking across a desert, people putting on protective glasses, an atomic blast, deer running, a couple, a time-lapse night scene, the Eiffel Tower, two men hammering at something, an ethnic festival. The sound is garbled]
Man
[rising] What does it mean?
Jeff
It's simple mathematical language that can be understood throughout the solar system. Translated into our language, it looks like this. [replays the transmission, this time in English]
Announcer
This jannemon at eight o'clock, it's everyone's favorite show! Earth! It's been one hundred Gelganighs since we first took species from seventeen different planets and put them all together, on the same planet! Oo-derp! They've fought and fallen in love! What will happen this Galgamog? Tune in jannemon at eight to find out. It's... Earth! On Fognl!
Jeff
I'm afraid that Earth, a-all of Earth, is nothing but an intergalactic reality-TV show.
Man 2
My God. We're famous! [everyone stands and whoops it up]
Jeff
Waaaait, you don't understand!
Man 3
[giddy blond] I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
Man 4
This is so awesome! [everyone clear out, cheering]
Others
Woo! Yeah! Woohoo!! [Jeff is left all alone]
Back at Nerzod Productions. Cartman is bent over once more, with his pants down. The visitors have finished working on him
Alien
That should get the relay working again. [begins to walk off. The boys follow] All right, Earthlings, if you'll step over this way we'll erase your memories and get you back to Earth. [a visitor brings him a ringing phone] Oh, excuse me. [picks up the receiver] This is Nagix. Uh huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it's, it's for sure? All right, I'll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks. [hangs up the phone and walks back to the boys] Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I'm afraid it won't be there for long. The show's been cancelled.
Kyle
What?? Who cancelled us?
Nagix
The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won't be funny anymore. [walks off to address the rest of the staff]
Stan
Oh shit, did we do that?
Nagix
Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I'm afraid Earth has been cancelled
Staff
Awww.
Nagix
Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud. [a smattering of applause] Let's call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources.
Stan
Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
Nagix
Wouldn't do any good.
Kyle
Dude, we have to try!
Stan
Please, take us to them! Please!
Nagix
All right, kids, we'll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody. [the boys look at each other, and several more scoops of ice cream falls out of the alien's taco ass]
Earth. A view of it from outer space. A few seconds later, an immense crane floats towards Earth with wrecking ball ready and beeper going. It stops. Two alien laborers sit inside and the driver activates the crane arm. The wrecking ball moves and strikes western Africa. A shot of people running across a bridge. The whole planet moves as if by an earthquake. Chef almost loses his balance at the space center as the ground undulates.
Chef
What the hell is that?!
Jeff
There's a huge ship of some kind in Earth's orbit! [schematics of the ship and of Earth appear on screen, and the impact point is shown as well] But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory!
Chef
Chaos theory??
Jeff
Chaos theory, it was, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That's the number of episodes they made of Punky Brewster before it was cancelled. Cancelled...
Chef
Huh?
Jeff
Don't you see? The show is over! The aliens are canceling Earth!
Chef
Oh my God! We have to stop them!
The boys walk down a futuristic sidewalk on a strange planet.
Voice
Welcome to Planet Fognl, home of the Joozians, who control all media in the universe. [the boys enter the universal network headquarters]
Receptionist
Can I help you?
Stan
Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
Receptionist
Where are you visiting from?
Stan
Uh, Earth?
Receptionist
Oooo, I watch that show all the time. [opens another set of doors and shows the boys in]
Joozian 1
Gaaahahaha. [notices the boys come in] Oh, sure, come on in, Earthlings. We're just checking out our new show.
Joozian 2
We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. It-it's a riot!
Joozian 1
They hate each other!
Joozian 2
Gah, why? [Stan nudges Kyle, who pulls a letter out from his pocket and reads]
Kyle
Mighty powerful network executives
Joozian 1
Oooo, I'm starving! You Earthlings have haglar yet?
Joozian 2
Oh yeah, let's do haglar.
Joozian 1
Where do you wanna go? Meroni's?
Joozian 2
Not on a Flakmar. Too crowded. Ohhh, Blackafelch!
Joozian 1
Oh, Blackafelch. Perfect.
Blackafelch Restaurant, later. Aliens of all kinds sit and enjoy their meals.
Joozian 2
This place is fantastic!
Stan
Look, we just want to talk to you about the show.
Kyle
Please don't cancel us. Please.
Joozian 1
Oh I'm sorry, Earthlings, but you have to realize the universe is a business.
Joozian 2
You've made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud!
Joozian 1
Yeah, a show should never go past a hundred episodes, or else it starts to get stale with ridiculously stupid plotlines and settings.
Waitress
[another Joozian] Here's your order of gespahtgaplachfenachenblah. [sets a large platter before the executives and lifts the cover. The executives dig in]
Stan
But sirs, we think our show is just getting good. [Kyle thinks about the food, then decides to taste it] I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
Kyle
Oh my God, this is great!
Joozian 1
You must have some Joozian ancestry.
Cartman
[miffed at the link, rests his head on his left hand] Tell us about it!
Stan
Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
Joozian 1
Oh my God! Would you look at the heglars on that joozinek?
Stan
Dude, we're trying to save our planet here?!
Joozian 1
Let's take the Earthlings to a hekmubah!
Joozian 2
Oh, yeah!
A hekmabah, a Joozian strip club. A Joozinek slithers around a dance pole
Joozian 1
Oh yeah, let's see those heglars!
Stan
Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-
Joozian 1
Oh, man, I am so wasted! [holds up a little box] Hey, do you Earthlings wanna try a little glach? [takes the box and pours out a line of purple powder. The other Joozian snorts it right up. The boys look on, saying nothing. Another line of purple powder and the first Joozian snorts up, then suddenly turns around] Agh-oh yeah!! [turns back] Oh, gluck yeah!! [Kenny begins snorting up at the other end of the line]
Kyle
Kenny! [Kenny stops]
Joozian 1
Meeh, screw this place! Let's go get a hotel room and a hooker!
Joozian 2
Oh yeah!
Joozian 1
Yeah! [they leave their chairs]
Back on earth, the massive cranes swings at Earth again. More quakes follow and the space center is damaged some more
Chef
We have to find a way to stop those aliens!
Jeff
[begins pacing] Oh, their ship is massive! There's no way to stop it! [stops] Wait a minute, jackets!
Chef
[smacks his hand onto his head] Oh no.
Jeff
If people don't wear jackets they could get cold. A cold is caused by a virus. A viru- a computer virus! We could make a computer virus and send it to their ships to disable their computers!
Chef
[thinks, then angrily] That doesn't make any God-damned sense!
An adult hotel. The Joozians are in bed with a hooker and they begin to disrobe.
Joozian 2
Ogh.
Joozian 1
Oh yeah!
Joozian 2
Good.
Joozian 1
Oh yeah! Yeah!! [goes to take another snort of purple powder. With his shirt off, one can see two small appendages, one on each shoulder]
Joozian 2
Woohoohoo! Yeah!
Joozian 1
Booyagh! Boy, Earthlings, is this a party or what?? [the boys sit on a couch looking on, bored.]
Joozian 2
Oh! Oh, that's it baby! You're getting my jagon hard! [the appendage on his right shoulder stiffens and lengthens]
Joozian 1
[returns to the side of the bed, by the second Joozian] Wohh. Yeah, let's party! [begins to suck on the Joozian's jagon]
Joozian 2
Yeah, suck my jagon!
Joozian 1
[stops and releases] Yeah! Now you suck on my jagon! [the second Joozian begins to suck on his jagon] Oh yeah!! Stick your finger in my thrusher! [the second Joozian begins putting his finger into some openings above the first Joozian's waist] Oh yeah, suck it. Suck that jagon! [the boys show more interest and some astonishment]
Stan
Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. [Kenny whips out a camera and takes a picture]
Joozian 1
[the other Joozian continues sucking on his jagon] Oh yes!! Oh yeah yeahyeah! Oh yeah!
Back at universal network headquarters. The Joozians have ice packs on their heads, recovering from the raunch they experienced the night before
Joozian 2
Oh, God. Eh eh, my head. [the four boys look on] What did we do?
Joozian 1
Oh man, I can't believe I sucked your jagon.
Joozian 2
Oh God, we did suck each other's jagons! You kids won't tell anybody about this, right??
Cartman
No.
Stan
[glances at Cartman and quickly thinks] No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!
Joozian 1
Oooo, I knew that was coming.
Joozian 2
They really got us by the nezmins.
Kyle
The Earth show can still be good. Just erase everyone's memory so we don't know we're a show.
Stan
I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
Cartman
There's even World War Three to look forward to.
Kyle
And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
Joozian 1
He-all right, all right Earthlings! Ya, you win! The show can stay on.
The Boys
All right!
Joozian 1
Just be sure to keep up the wars and violence.
Joozian 2
Well, we've got a five o'clock with the Yurka producers. [still disheveled, he hops off his chair and goes to a lever] Nice meeting you Earthlings. Bye! [pulls the lever down and in an instant the boys are back at the bus stop]
The bus stop, day. Kenny is missing.
Cartman
[yawns] Uuugh.
Kyle
Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Cartman
That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
Kenny
[walks up with something in his hand] (Hey you guys, look.) [the other boys look]
Kyle
What the hell is that?
Kenny
(I don't know.)
Chef
[drives up in his station wagon and steps out] Hello there, children!
The Boys
Hey Chef. [Chef steps behind the boys]
Stan
Chef, Kenny has a picture of two green things sucking each other's shoulders. [Chef takes a look at the picture of the two Joozians sucking each other's jagons]
Cartman
What is it, Chef?
Chef
I don't know. But something tells me this picture might be very important, children. [hands the picture back to Kenny] You should hang on to it.
TV spot
Announcer
Attention universe! Be sure to tune in next week for another exciting episode of... Earth! The Asians [crowd scene] are reeeally steamed at the Russians [crossing a bridge]. The zebras try to get along with the buffalo. [composite shot] And Americans [walking the dog] and Iraqis [dancing] have an all-out brawl. [Saddam is shown] It's outrageous fun and it's all new! Earth! On Fognl.
End of Cancelled

Krazy Kripples
South Park, day. Now showing at the South Park Community Theatre. Fanfare begins with a drumroll, a spotlight hits its mark on stage and an announcer speaks
Announcer
Ladies and Gentlemen, give it up for JIMMY! [the curtains part and Jimmy walks forward wearing a tuxedo] Thank you! Wow. What a terrific audience. [the curtains close behind him] I know what most of you are thinking. "Hey, uh-that guy stole my show..." [long pause] Wow, what a great audience. And how about this Michael Jackson guy, huh? I mean, come on... [long pause] Wow, what a great audience. [the soft sound of one person clapping is heard] Uh... l... lights, please? [the house lights click on and only one person is seen in the seats: Butters]
Butters
Hey Jimmy.
Jimmy
Butters, w-where is everybody?
Butters
Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
Jimmy
Christopher Reeve? Christopher Reeve?!
Butters
You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
Jimmy
I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!
Butters
Ww-well, because he got crippled, but now he can move his finger. He is an inspiration to us all. That's why everyone ditched on your show.
Jimmy
So then, how come you came?
Butters
Well, because I said I would. Oh, I'm a dork, huh? [Jimmy stews on stage]
Kenny McCormick Memorial Town Square. Mayor McDaniels is on stage with her aides. Above them a banner reads "STEM CELL RESEARCH." A crowd of people has formed in front of the stage
Mayor McDaniels
And so without further ado, here's the most courageous, most amazing man on the planet, Christopher Reeve. [everyone claps and the curtains open. The mayor and her aides step aside. Christopher Reeve rolls out towards the mic. Jimmy shows up to watch.]
Reeve
Thank you, thank you, wow, what a great audience. [stops to catch his breath with a fixed smile in place] I just flew into South Park. [catches his breath] Used to be I didn't need an airplane.
Townspeople
Awwwww. [a smattering of applause]
Reeve
As most of you know, [catches his breath] I am a strong supporter of stem-cell research.
Jimmy
Say, fellas! Thanks a lot for goin' to my ...c-comedy show! ["It is a proven fact that stem-cell research"]
Cartman
We didn't go to your comedy show.
Jimmy
I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious! ["can add many years to the lives of people who have been disabled by accidents"]
Stan
Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. ["or other ways."]
Jimmy
Ooh, Christopher Reeve! Whoop-de-freakin-do!
Kyle
Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
Stan
Yeah dude, not cool.
Reeve
Though it is controversial, [catches his breath] stem cell research is critical [catches his breath] in the quest for helping [catches his breath] the disabled.
Jimmy
I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH! [waddles off in a huff]
Stan
Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
Kyle
Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. [they turn right and trot off]
Timmy
Ha-a-aaa-haaa-a.
Jimmy
[approaching] Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy?
Timmy
Timmeh!!
Jimmy
Why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way, very much.
Timmy
Rrruh Timmeh!
Reeve
In the coming days [catches his breath] I will prove to the world [catches his breath] that stem-cell research is a miracle.
The bus stop, day. The boys are on the snow playing with their trucks.]
Cartman
Beep beep beep. Move it, Kenny! Beep.
Jimmy
Hey there fellas.
Stan
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
Timmy
Timmih!!
Jimmy
Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled. [start laughing. The boys go back to playing with their trucks.]
Kyle
What?
Jimmy
To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!
Stan
That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. [Jimmy and Timmy turn and walk away]
Cartman
[jumps up and catches up to them] Hey, wait a minute! [Timmy and Jimmy stop] You guys can't just start a club and tell me I can't be in it!
Jimmy
Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.
Cartman
Can too!
Jimmy
[turns to Timmy] Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One. [begins to laugh. Timmy begins to laugh as well] You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is. [Jimmy and Timmy laugh, and walk away laughing]
Cartman
Oh God-damnit!!
Kyle
Cartman, just stay out of it.
Cartman
But they say I can't be in their club!!
Stan
Cartman, trust me. [Kenny pushes his own truck away] We don't want any part in this one.
"The T-shirt Factory", later. Timmy and Jimmy walk up to it and enter
Jimmy
Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy. [Timmy has a box on his lap]
McGillicuddy
Hello, boys. What can I do for you?
Jimmy
[takes the box from Timmy] Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club. [Timmy beams with delight] We just came up with a name this morning. [McGillicuddy opens the box, pulls out the shirt, and his jaw drops. The shirt reads, "THE CRIPS"]
McGillicuddy
Uh... boys, I don't think you wanna wear these shirts
Jimmy
Why not?
McGillicuddy
Well, because there already is a group that calls themselves the Crips, and I don't think they'd like it too much.
Jimmy
[stunned] ...There's already a Crips?!
McGillicuddy
Well, sure, they're all over at Five Points area in Denver. You've never heard of them?
Jimmy
No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?
McGillicuddy
...Oh, I am stayin' out of this one. [leaves the counter]
"The T-shirt Factory", outside. The doors open and Jimmy and Timmy exit
Jimmy
Can you believe it, Timmy? All this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves, and we didn't know it.
Timmy
[excited] Timmmeh!
Jimmy
Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.
The Larry King Show on HNN, on air.
King
My guest tonight is the brilliant star of stage and screen, Mr. Christopher Reeve, who, with the help of stem-cell research, is now able to move his arms.
Reeve
Thanks for having me on again, Larry.
King
All right. Chris, the whole world is waiting. Why don't you show us what stem-cell research has done for you. [with that fixed grin, Reeve strains to lift his right arm a few inches, then sets it down again.] Amazing. Isn't that amazing, folks? Now, Chris, there're some people who say stem-cell research is wrong, that taking cells from a fetus is... unethical.
Reeve
Well, it just proves that the public needs to be educated [catches his breath] about stem-cell research. See, the stem cells from a fetus like this one [pulls a dead fetus up from an unseen container] can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged. They are the most powerful thing on the planet.
King
And how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells, Chris?
Reeve
Well, it's very simple. [takes the fetus and cracks it open like a coconut, then sucks out its contents and tosses it aside] And now you can see, my arms have better movement.
King
Wow. [begins clapping] Wow.
Five Points, Denver. A bum pushes a cart full of his belongings past Denver Meat Packing, a rundown warehouse. Sirens, gunshots, and a woman's screams are heard.
Jimmy
Excuse me, sir. [the bum stops, startled] we're looking for a group of people called the Crips.
Bum
You are?
Jimmy
Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.
Bum
The Crips hang out at that old warehouse down there, [points to the building he just passed] but ...nobody goes in there.
Jimmy
[moves forward] Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.
Timmy
Timmmih! [follows]
Denver Meat Packing, inside. The music is thumping, there's gambling and general conversation going on. Jimmy and Timmy walks in.
Jimmy
Well hello everyone. [music abruptly stops] I'm Jim Swanson, and this is my friend Timmy.
Timmy
Timmmih! [awkward silence, then softly] Tih... ti-timmih.
Jimmy
[to a friend at left, as he points to the duo] Well, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. Timmy and I are both true Crips, born and raised. We're the only Crips in South Park, where we live, and we would love to join your fa-fa-fabtasitc Denver chapter.
Large Crip
Is they for real, manh?
Jimmy
We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?
Braided Crip
The only Crips is born Crips, dawg.
Tall Crip
Yeah, you can't become a Crip by accident, fool!
Jimmy
I agree. I mean, it's like [enunciates] "come on"! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?
Timmy
Timmih! [silence]
Jimmy
Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?
Buff Crip
All right, you wanna thug with the Five Point Crips? Bitches, all you gotta do is pop some punk-ass Bloods.
Jimmy
Well, sure. Tim and I would love to pop some punk-ass Bloods. We're terrific at it.
Timmy
Timmih?
Jimmy
[turns and answers softly] I don't know, Timmy, just play along.
Timmy
Uh-tu-Timmih!
Buff Crip
So you sayin' yuh down?
Jimmy
Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown. [music starts up again, and Timmy and Jimmy leave. As they walk down the street a rap song plays]
Jimmy
Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?
Timmy
Timmih!
Jimmy
That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park. [as they walk, a police car rolls up and the passenger-side officer calls out]
Officer
Hey you kids.
Jimmy
[stops and looks] Well hello, officers.
Officer
What the hell do you think you're doin'?
Jimmy
We're goin' to pop some punk-ass Bloods.
Timmy
Timmih! [the officers simply look at each other and drive off.]
Jimmy
[sees something] Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store. ["Ribs N Gass." A lot of gang members are milling around in front of the store] That must be what the fellas meant by "pop some punk-ass Bloods." They want us to get them some soda pop and treats. [the gang members notice them coming and stop to look. They cross the street] Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure.
Timmy
Oh, Timmih. [a truck appears in the distance and comes up fast.]
Driver
[noticing almost too late] Oh shit! [swerves to avoid the duo and slams into the convenience store they were trying to reach. The store and truck go up in a ball of flames while Jimmy and Timmy stop in their tracks]
Jimmy
Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!
Back at Denver Meat Packing, night. Jimmy and Timmy are back at the warehouse.
Buff Crip
Yo yo, listen up y'all! Let me tell you about my little Gs, Roller and 4 Legs here. They just smoked thirteen Bloods in one night!
Crip 1
One night?
Crip 2
You're kiddin'? You're kiddin'? One night?
Buff Crip
That ain't never been done before!
58 Crip
And they got us marshmallows and ginger ale.
Crips
[chattering] Uh huh. Cool. He's right.
Jimmy
So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?
Buff Crip
You're not just in, you're the baddest mofo Crips in town! Cipac! [a Crip steps forward] Turn up the beat so we can celebrate our new Gs Five-Points style!
Cipac
All right. [hobbles off]
Jimmy
Wow, these guys really are crippled. [the music starts up and the Crips start dancing] Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant.
Timmy
Timmih!
Jimmy's home. A car drives up and drops off Timmy and Jimmy. The occupants are Crips.
Jimmy
Thanks for the ride home, fellas. We sure had a ...terrific time.
Cipac
Alrighty. Keep it real, dawg.
Jimmy
You dawgs keep it real, too. [Cipac flashes the Crips signs for "West Coast Crips" and the boys return the gesture]
Timmy
Timmih! [the Crips drive off]
Jimmy
Well, that sure was a terrific time. Let's go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits, Timmy.
Timmy
Timmih! [Jimmy goes on home as Timmy rolls off]
Jimmy's house, inside. His parents sit before the TV, his mom worried.
Mom
[jumps up] There you are, Jimmy!
Jimmy
Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?
Pops
Jimmy, your mother was gettin' worried about you.
Jimmy
No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool. [turns and hobbles off]
Outside, somewhere, day. A reporter begins speaking to the camera.
Reporter
Tom, I'm standing out front of the Stem Cell Research Facility with terrific news. Christopher Reeve, who was once paralyzed, claims that he can now stand.
Reeve
[flanked by two doctors, one of them carrying a medical organ cooler] Thank you everyone. [pulls out a fetus from the cooler and holds it in his left hand] To most people, this is just an ordinary fetus. But to people like me, [lifts it into the air] it's hope. [snaps it open as before and sucks out its juices.]
Crowd
Uugh.
Reeve tosses the carcass away, then he drops his feet to the floor, then he slowly rises from his wheelchair and raises his arms in victory. The crowd oooos and ahhhs.
Mr. Garrison
[arm around Mr. Slave] What an inspiration.
Reporter
Tom, many celebrities have spoken out in protest of stem-cell research, but, after seeing this, how can they protest now? [Reeve takes out another fetus and sucks it dry. Stan and the boys walk by]
Stan
[admonishing] Stay clear, guys, stay clear.
Kyle
Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
City Wok, day. Mr. Kim is wiping the counter down. Timmy and Jimmy enter dressed in their Crip outfits.
Mr. Kim
Hey [studies the boys before him, then holds up his arms] Hey, I don't want no trouble!
Jimmy
Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung... Pao Chicken, please.
Mr. Kim
I don't want no trouble! You just... take what you want and leave!
Timmy
Timmih!
Mr. Kim
[as if Timmy had barked an order] OH! Okay, okay! [steps to the cash register and opens it] I open register
Timmy
Timmih!
Jimmy
What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please.
Timmy
Timmih.
Mr. Kim
[pulls out a stack of bills and sets them on the counter, then holds his arms up again] Here. Here one hundred twelve dorrar! It's all I have. Yeh take!
Jimmy
[confused] Huh?
Mr. Kim
You take! Uh one hundred twelve dorrar!
Jimmy
Ah- are you sure?
Mr. Kim
I no want no trouble. Just take it and leave!
Jimmy
[approaches the counter. Mr. Kim goes about preparing the food order] Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person. [gets the money and shows it to Timmy] Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something.
Mr. Kim
Here! Here two order of Kung Pao Chicken, and small ice tea!
Jimmy
Actually, it was a regular lemonade.
Mr. Kim
[mortified at his error] AAAAAGH-agh!! [bows] I sorry! I sorry! I no want no trouble. [reaches for a cup and prepares a regular lemonade] Here. Remonade. [sets it on the counter. Jimmy reaches for it] Now go, just go!
Jimmy
Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.
Timmy
[smiles] Timmih!
Mr. Kim
[soon lowers his arms and places a call] Hello! Police? I've just been robbed by two gang members!
Jimmy's house, later. His parents are standing by the kitchen's breakfast nook sipping coffee. A door opens in the living room, then closes.
Pops
Jimmy? Jimmy, could you come into the kitchen please?
Jimmy
[enters] Yo, Mamsie. What's up, Pops?
Pops
Uh have a seat, Jim. Your mother and I need to talk to you. [Jimmy approaches a chair and struggles to climb up on it. He gets no help from his parents. He succeeds in climbing the chair, then in sitting upright. He settles down.] Son, your mother and I have noticed a change in your behavior. And... we're worried that you might be involved in a gang.
Jimmy
A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.
Mamsie
Then it's true! Oh, Ryan, it's true! [buries her face in Ryan's chest and sobs uncontrollably]
Jimmy
Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean [enunciates the nest two words] come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much.
Ryan
Jimmy, those people you're hanging out with are no good.
Jimmy
Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends.
Mamsie
And what about your standup comedy, Jim, huh? Are you just giving up on that, too?
Jimmy
[now naturally] Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!
Ryan
Uh Jimmy, we've told you before. God made you the way he did for a reason!
Jimmy
Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.
Ryan
That's right. You were sent here through the vengeful and angry hand of God to teach your mother and I a lesson. And that's a big responsibility, son.
Jimmy
Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left. [hops off the chair and ambles off. His mom sobs again. Ryan holds her]
A darkened lab. Christopher Reeve is pacing back and forth, having a headache.
Reeve
Where's that delivery of new fetuses?! Feeling weak again.
Aide
[rushes in with a fresh delivery] Here's the new shipment, sir. [Reeve lunges for the box and rips it out of the aide's hands, pushing the aide away] Hey! [Reeve tears into the box, opens the cooler, grabs a fetus, and starts sucking its juices out. A few seconds later, a door at the far wall opens]
Man
Hello there, Christopher. [Reeve is upset that he's been disturbed, but turns around and turns pleasant]
Reeve
Well, well, Gene Hackman, my nemesis from the movies. How are you?
Hackman
I'm good. You?
Reeve
I am better with each passing day. [turns around and pulls out another fetus] Stronger and more agile. [sucks its juices out as Hackman looks on]
Hackman
Christopher, I've come to ask you to stop what you're doing?
Reeve
[with fetus still on his lips] What?
Hackman
Using stem cells is like playing God. You should leave nature alone.
Reeve
And go back to the way I was? Is that what you're saying, Hackman?
Hackman
I'm saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards you're dealt, Christopher.
Reeve
[raises his arms in a fit of rage, then turns away] Stop calling me Christopher! That name no longer has meaning to me! Christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair! Always being pushed around by others! The old Christopher Reeve is dead! From now on, I am... [looks back menacingly] Chris!
Jimmy's house, night, living room. He sits on the floor between the couch and the coffee table working on a jigsaw puzzle.
Jimmy
Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six- [outside, a car rolls up to the house slowly. Four Bloods look at the house, all of them with masks on]
Blood
[front passenger side] Payback time, mothafucka! [the Bloods starts spraying the house with bullets]
Jimmy
[looks around as the bullets tear up the windows] Jesus Christ! [dives to the floor and crawls to the other side of the table, then rises up.] Holy G...guacamole! [the bullets start tearing up the couch and the front door. Jimmy dives to the floor, then rises up a few seconds later.] Freakin' Frijoles! [dives to the floor again. The front door is gone and the couch's stuffing is all over the place. Its springs pop out. The right-side portrait next to the door falls. The bullets stop, and Jimmy rises once again] Leapin' L-langosta. [the left-side portrait falls]
Blood
East Side Bloods! [the Bloods drop back into their car and peel off. Some time later, Officer Barbrady and his men show up to take reports and check out the crime scene. Timmy has returned to be with Jimmy. Two people walk up to the Swansons]
Hyde
We're Detectives Hyde and Richardson from the Special Gang unit in Denver.
Jimmy
Any word on who shot up me and Timmy's houses, officer?
Richardson
Word on the street is it was a retaliation hit by the Bloods.
Jimmy
The... B-Bloods?
Hyde
You know, smart-mouth! Your rival gang! The Bloods are at war with the Crips, they kill each other all the time!
Jimmy
The-they do??
Richardson
Don't act like you don't know, you lil' punk! The Crips and Bloods hate each other, and if you stay in that gang, you're gonna end up dead too.
Jimmy
But... but why do they hate each other?
Hyde
Look kid, I used to be a Crip myself, but I'm not anymore!
Jimmy
Oh, so you used ssstemm cells like Christopher Reeve?
Hyde
[realizes this conversation is fruitless] Come on. The only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed. [the detectives leave. Jim's mom begins to sob and then runs into the house.]
Ryan
[follows her in] Sarah!
Jimmy
[begins to pace before Timmy] Oh boy, Timmy, we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth. Now they're at war with the people who are crippled from an accident. Boy were we wrong.
Timmy
[agreeing] Tim-mih.
Jimmy
Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to s-stop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.
Timmy
Timmih!!
Jimmy
You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.
Timmy
Timmih!!
Jimmy
This is gonna be t-terrific!
South Park, next day, in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty.
Reporter
[same as before] Tom, several years ago, actor Christopher Reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed. The irony, of course, is that the man who played Superman could no longer walk. America watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers, then his arms. And now, seen for the first time on HBC, Christopher Reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head. [Christopher walks over to a green truck and lifts the front end up over his head. The crowd oohs and claps for him]
Randy
Oh, what a fighter.
Gerald
That brave, brave man.
Liane
He's an inspiration to us all.
Reporter
Tom, the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given Christopher Reeve almost superhuman strength.
Hackman
[appears with a crowd of people] Chris, that's enough!
Reeve
[looks at Hackman and drops the truck] Hello, Gene! So good to see you!
Hackman
You're cured, Chris. It's time to stop using stem cells.
Reeve
Stem-cell research has made me stronger than I ever thought possible! Why stop now?!
Reporter
Uh Tom, apparently, Gene Hackman, the man who played Superman's enemy Lex Luthor in the movies, has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research. If that isn't ironic, Tom, I don't know what is.
Hackman
They're affecting your mind, Chris. If you won't stop using stem cells, then we'll stop you!
Reeve
Stop me?! Stop me?! HA!! [reaches over, picks up the truck clear over his head, and throws it at Hackman. Hackman and his crowd jump clear of the truck's path, screaming. The truck lands upside down where the crown stood. Reeve then runs down the street and onto a car] You won't stop me, Hack Man! [runs off the truck and jumps away maniacally] Ha HA! Ha HA! Ha haa haa! [jumps higher and higher until he clears buildings with each jump] Ya ha ha! Yaa haha!
Reporter
Tom, if irony were made of strawberries, we'd all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now.
Denver Recreation Center, night. Gang members file through the doors. Jimmy and Timmy greet everyone at the door. Timmy is disguised as Groucho Marx, Jimmy wears a ten-gallon hat.
Jimmy
Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside. [the last of the guests enter] Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.
Janitor
[an elderly man soon exits] Are you sure you got everything you need, young man?
Jimmy
We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by.
Mr. Appleby
Just remember to make sure the kids play safe in the pool area.
Jimmy
You bet. [he and Timmy move around him and into the center]
Mr. Appleby
I'll be back at seven to let you out. You kids have a good time.
Jimmy
Oh, we will. [Mr. Appleby closes the door and locks it.]
Denver Recreation Center, inside. A group of Bloods enter the gym and stop in their tracks. At the other end of the gym is a group of Crips, seated on some bleachers behind a basketball hoop. The Crips stand in reply.
Buff Crip
The Bloods!
Blood 1
Oh shit! It's a trap!
Blood 2
Muthafuckin Crips tryin' to smoke us all out!
Crip
What the hell is goin' on here? [Jimmy and Timmy step into the middle ground between the two gangs]
Jimmy
It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles.
Timmy
Timmih!
Jimmy
But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along. [immediately, both sides draw weapons and aim them at each other. Once all the weapons are out...] Theeerrre's pizzaaa.
Nighttime, near the city. The reporter stands next to a man-made lake.
Reporter
Tom, over five years ago, doctors told Christopher Reeve that he would never walk again, but the resilient actor fought back, struggled against all odds, and has now built his very own Legion of Doom! [Its headquarters now appears behind him] The once immobile Mr. Reeve's new organization will be committed to world domination and evil. What an inspirational story, Tom.
Legion of Doom Headquarters, inside. Christopher Reeve is standing before a group of villains, both real and imagined.
Reeve
I have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery, [Osama bin Laden and Dr. Doom are shown, then Blank Manta and Saddam Hussein] Their desire for world conquest, [Cheetah, Kim Jong-il, and David Blaine are shown] and their hatred of all things good! [Professor Chaos is shown] And I've assembled this group for one purpose! To once and for all find a way to... [the picture behind him changes from a fist smashing Earth to a picture of Gene Hackman] get rid of Hack Man!! [laughs maniacally for effect, but no other villain moves]
Dr. Doom
Uhhh, how about domination of the world?
Saddam Hussein
Yeah. Or uh, death to the infidels?
Reeve
Silence! OUR job is to see to it that Hack Man is put out of commission.
Professor Chaos
Oh boy, General Disarray, may- maybe we just oughtta stay outta this one.
Hackman
[bursts through the doors with his supporters] Not so fast, Chris!
Reeve
[sucking on yet another fetus] Hack Man!
Hackman
We just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research. Your fetus-sucking days are over!
Reeve
No... [grabs his head in frustration] NOOOO!
Hackman
And now we're going to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again!
Denver Recreation Center, inside. The Bloods and Crips challenge each other.
Buff Crip
You stupid mofos are dead!
Blood 3
Make the first shot, punk!
Jimmy
Hold it! Don't you see? It doesn't matter if we were crippled from birth, or crippled in an accident. We're all brothers.
Blood 4
Save it, fool! Crips ain't our brothers! [the atmosphere grows tense]
Jimmy
Look, we have the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?
58 Crip
You talkin' crazy, dawg.
Blood 5
Yeah, we ain't playin', sucka!
Jimmy
Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean, [enunciates] Come on! [several tense seconds pass]
Buff Crip
Wait a minute. What did you say?
Jimmy
I said, "I mean, [enunciates] Come on!"
Blood 4
You know, maybe he's right. I mean, [enunciates] Come on!
Jimmy
[enunciates] Come on.
Buff Crip
I guess we could at least give havin' fun together a try. It's like [enunciates] Come on.
Blood 6
Yeah. Come on.
Crip 2
Yeah, that's right. Come on.
Jimmy
Come on.
Someone
Come on.
All
[in agreement] Yeah, that's right. Come on. [moments later rap music is playing, gang members gather in the pool and one prepares for a dive. In the gym gang members play basketball without arguing. One of them dances along the foul line. In another room gang members play pool. The camera stops at Jimmy and three members - two Crips and one Blood]
Buff Crip
I've gotta give you two dawgs props for puttin' an end to all this hate.
Jimmy
I told you, lock-ins at the rec center always work. And you know, I've learned something, too. I was player-hatin' Christopher Butthole Reeve because he got more attention than me. But just like... y-you guys, I need to learn to control my a... anger.
Blood
Right on!
Crip
[walks up to Timmy] Hey little roller, try some of this chronic shit.
Timmy
Timmih! [takes a hit. Both Crips and Bloods laugh]
Jimmy
I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'. [a song begins, and Jimmy approaches the camera] The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?
Gang Members
 
It used to be that Crips and Bloods didn't get along,
But now we're all a family, so we wrote this song.
Naaa na naaa, Crips and Bloods. Naaa na naaa, hope and love.
Naaa na naaa, friendly thugs.

Outer space. Christopher Reeve is flung into space in a pane of glass.
Reeve
You haven't seen the last of me, Hack Man! I will be back!!
The woods near South Park, night. Stan and friends watch the celestial spectacle.
Stan
Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
Kyle
Me too.
End of Krazy Kripples

Toilet Paper
South Park Elementary, day. A new classroom. As the camera follows a new teacher around, the following kids are seen working with clay. Clyde presses the pottery wheel pedal as Bebe molds a vase on the wheel. Wendy watches. Tweek, Red, and Pip work on clay on the table near the wall. In the foreground, Token presses the pottery wheel pedal as Annie molds a vase. Butters, Kevin, and Francis work on their own projects. Kenny, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are laughing at their project, which didn't require the use of the pottery wheel.
Teacher
[walks through the class] Okay. Good, children, good. Remember to feel the clay. Be one with the clay. Nice. Uh huh. [the boys still laugh at their monument]
Cartman
[laughing] Put more clay on the balls.
Teacher
[noticing] Boys! [they stop laughing as she points] What is that?
Kyle
A reindeer?
Teacher
You know, I've had it! You four boys never take art class seriously!
Cartman
[retorts] What a crime. [the three others chuckle, then laugh out loud]
Teacher
[displeased, with arms crossed] You think art is not important?
Stan
Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.
Butters
[pipes up] I love art class!
Stan
See?
Teacher
[reaches for their creation and grabs it by the shaft] Do you think this is funny?! [shakes it around for effect] Do you think this is funny, huh?! [ends up looking at the head, as if she's about to suck on it. The boys cover their mouths to hold their laughter, knowing how she looks with their creation like that, but soon they burst out laughing. The teacher now cradles the project] Well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making new pottery! [the laughter stops and the boys' jaws drop.]
Cartman
You can't do that!
Teacher
I certainly can! I'm your teacher!
Cartman
You're an art teacher!
Teacher
Make it two hours!
Cut to after school. The art teacher sits at her desk watching the boys work on a proper vase on the pottery wheel. Kyle is pressing the pedal. The boys are angry at their teacher
Stan
Mrs. Streibel thinks she's so cool!
Kyle
How dare she talk to us like that?!
Kenny
(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)
Cartman
We can't let her get away with this! [voicing dropping to almost a whisper] I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
Stan
Like what?
Cartman
Like find out where Mrs. Streibel lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Kyle
TP her house?
Cartman
Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
Kyle
Oh.
Cartman
[sensing Kyle's reluctance] What's the matter, Kyle? You chicken? [begins strutting like a chicken and making chicken noises. Kyle kicks Cartman in the balls in anger] Ugh! [drops to his knees, then gets one leg up]
Teacher
Quiet, boys. This isn't playtime, you're being punished!
Stan
[glares back at her, then softly] Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
Cartman
[in pain] Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!
Henry's Supermarket, day. A woman watches her son ride in a coin-operated ride outside the store. Inside, the four boys approach checkout line 3 with two carts stacked high with packages of Kush Tush toilet paper.
Stan
D'you think that's enough?
Cartman
Should be fine.
Kyle
Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
Cartman
Okay. [reaches behind the other boys and grabs something] Here we go, pack of chewing gum. [tosses it into the first cart. They approach the cash register]
Cashier
Hello boys. Find everything you need?
Cartman
Yep. All set.
Cashier
[begins scanning the packages] Mkay', let's see here. Toilet paper ["beep" $1.50 for a four-pack] Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] So, what are you kids up to tonight? ["beep"]
Cartman
Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
Cashier
Nice relaxing night at home, huh? Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] Aaand toilet paper ["beep." He picks up the gum] Eh, hey. [holds up the gum] Now you kids be careful with this chewing gum. Don't go sticking it under tables.
Stan
Okay
Cashier
Okay. Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep."] You know, son, I remember you comin' in last week and buying this much toilet paper. ["beep"]
Cartman
Heh yeah, that that's right.
Cashier
... Toilet paper ["beep"] Toilet paper ["beep"]
Kyle
You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?
Cartman
No. Last Thursday night was fajitas night.
Kyle
Oh. [flashes disgust] Uuugh.
Mrs. Streibel's house, later, that night. The boys walk up to the house carrying black trash bags of toilet paper.
Stan
Is this the right house?
Cartman
It's the right address-wait! Look there! [the teacher prepares the dining-room table] There's Mrs. Streibel! This is the place. [loosens the drawstring on his back and lets the sides fall away. In the dining room, a boy and girl arrive and sit at table]
Kyle
Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
Cartman
So?
Kyle
So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
Stan
Kyle, we all agreed to do this!
Kyle
We didn't say nothin' about no kids, man!
Cartman
Kyle, you're being an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah. [takes out a roll and advances a bit] Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! [unleashes the first roll]
Kenny
(Yeah! Fuck you!)
Majestic music plays as Kenny unleashes his roll. Stan unleashes a roll. Cartman tosses off another one and grins. More rolls of paper fly onto the roof. Kyle tosses up a roll, unsure of doing so. Stan unleashes another one, and his glee is unabashed. Kenny tosses off another one. More and more rolls fly over the roof. Kyle freezes in awe of their vandalism. Toilet paper covers the house, the garage, and the trees around the house. The boys head for the sidewalk.
Cartman
Come on, let's go! [he and Kenny cross the road and drop down to a ditch on the other side. Stan follows]
Kyle
What have we done? [Stan looks back and gets Kyle]
Stan
Let's go, Kyle! [drags him off. Kyle is transfixed for a bit, then turns to follow Stan. A last shot of the house, and then the boys reach their bus stop gasping for air.]
The bus stop
Kyle
We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
Cartman
Aw man, that was sooo awesome! [smiles]
Kyle
How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?! It'll take them days to clean that up!
Cartman
Who cares??
Kyle
Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
Cartman
Me?? [takes a couple steps forward] There's toilet paper on your hands, too, Kyle. [Kyle blanches]
Stan
Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
Kyle's house, after bedtime. Kyle's room. He is asleep, but begins to have nightmares.
Kyle
Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]
Mrs. Streibel
AAAAAAAAA!
Mr. Streibel
Honey, what is it?? Oh, Jesus no! Our house!
The Streibel Girls
[crying] Mommy! Mommy!
Mr. Streibel
[with her family around her] Whyyy? Whyyy?
Kyle
[wakes up, startled] Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are in their regular classroom chatting, waiting for class to begin.
Butters
Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streibel's house got covered with toilet paper.
Clyde
Yeah. They say it's gonna take three weeks to get it all down.
Cartman
Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin' to her.
Butters
I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
Cartman
Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caught, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. [the bell rings and Mr. Garrison enters with some books.]
Mr. Garrison
Okay children, let's take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.
Cartman
[snaps his fingers] Damn!
Kyle
Oh God!
Outside the counselor's office. The boys sit on chairs next to the door - the bench is gone. Kyle looks around nervously.
Kyle
How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
Cartman
Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
Stan
We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
Cartman
Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
Kyle
I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality
Stan
Yes, dude!
Cartman
Kyle, it's very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??
Kyle
Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
Cartman
[exasperated] Oh, for Christ's sake!
Stan
Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He's better at being in trouble than anybody.
Cartman
Thank you, Stan. [the doorknow begins to turn] Sh sh, here they come, here they come. [the door opens and Mr. Mackey appears] "And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
Mr. Mackey
We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?
Kenny
(Me??)
Mr. Mackey
Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k? [Kenny hops off and enters the office, and Mr. Mackey closes the door. The other boys' jaws drop a bit.]
Cartman
Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
Kyle
Why are they doing us one at a time?
Cartman
They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
Kyle
[brightens up] I can get a better deal?
Cartman
Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
The Streibel house. Mr. Streibel is removing the toilet paper from the trees and house with a broom. He's already filled two trash bags of toilet paper and is filling a third.
Mr. Streibel
There we go. That should be about the last of it. [Officer Barbrady passes by with police tape, stretching it out from tree to tree. The camera pulls back to show the house is also covered in police tape] Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing?
Officer Barbrady
Crime scene investigation! [pulls out a small tape recorder and starts speaking into it] There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? [turns it off]
Mr. Streibel
Ah... look, we really don't wanna make a big deal out of this.
Officer Barbrady
[noticing the trash bags] Is that the toilet paper there? I'll need to take those bags as evidence.
Mr. Streibel
Look it's just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid.
Officer Barbrady
You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!
Mr. Streibel
I was here.
Officer Barbrady
Aha!! Got you!
Mr. Streibel
Officer, why would I TP my own house?
Officer Barbrady
Insurance?
Mr. Streibel
It wasn't me, okay? Now, if you don't mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal.
Officer Barbrady
[grabs him by the collar] Now you listen to me! Whoever TP'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It's only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.
Mr. Streibel
You really have nothing better to do, do you?
Officer Barbrady
No I do not.
Kyle's house, after bedtime. Kyle's room. He is asleep, but the nightmares return.
Kyle
Noo! No. [visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.] Noo! [an image of Mrs. Streibel's house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]
Mrs. Streibel
AAAAAAAAA!
Mr. Streibel
Oh, Jesus no! Our house!
The Streibel Girls
[crying] Mommy! Mommy!
Nancy Kerrigan
[being treated on the ice rink] Whyyy? Whyyy? Whyyy?
Kyle
[wakes up, startled] Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth! [hops off the bed and runs to the bedroom door] Mooooomm! [opens the door and finds Cartman in the hallway]
Cartman
[in rave tones] Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
Kyle
I was... I was just going to get a drink of water.
Cartman
No need. I have one for you right here. [presents a glass of water to him]
Kyle
[takes the glass] Oh. Okay. Thanks.
Cartman
Is there anything else I can get for you?
Kyle
Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
Cartman
You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. [closes the door]
Park County Juvenile Hall, day. Inside, the warden leads Officer Barbrady to Cell Block 4.
Warden
Josh Meyers TP'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year. [fumbles for his keys.] He's a real monster.
Officer Barbrady
I just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think.
Warden
Just remember: he'd toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance. [finally opens the door] He's the last cell on your left. [Barbrady enters and finds himself in an old part of the Hall. He walks past the prisoners and arrives at Josh's cell. It is a brick cell with a thick glass wall where prison bars would normally be. Holes in the glass allow for conversation. Josh has paintings of toilet paper around the cell.]
Officer Barbrady
Hello, Josh. My name is Officer Barbrady. I'm with the South Park police.
Josh
[affecting a Hopkins accent] That's a terrible cologne you're wearing, officer. You should try something more... casual.
Officer Barbrady
I was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case?
Josh
And why would I do that? Because I'm such a charming fella?
Officer Barbrady
Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?
Josh
[turns away] Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don't allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.
Officer Barbrady
You... know I can't give you toilet paper, Josh.
Josh
[turns back] No, but it was worth a try, wasn't it? [a closeup of Josh's face] Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town. You must have had larger inspirations. What happened to those... big-city dreams?
Officer Barbrady
[reflecting] Well, that's kind of personal.
Josh
[extreme closeup] Quid pro quo, officer. Tell me what I want to know. And I'll help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house.
Officer Barbrady
Look kid, I have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house. Tell me what you know.
Josh
Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them. [approaches the drop slot as Barbrady slides the packet of photos in, then walks back and takes them out for review.] Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is.
Officer Barbrady
So you think there was more than one. Why?
Josh
[puts the photos behind his back] Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?
Officer Barbrady
Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! [cries uncontrollably]
Josh
[closes his eyes, satisfied.] Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves. Find out where the toilet paper came from, officer, and you just might catch your man.
South Park Elementary, day. Kids are moving towards their classes, passing each other in the process. Stan and Kenny are talking with Clyde, Craig, and Kevin.
Cartman
Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second? [Stan waves bye to Clyde, Craig, and Kevin, and they leave. He and Kenny approach Cartman talks in hushed tones] I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
Stan
What about him?
Cartman
Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
Kenny
(I think so too.)
Cartman
Kyle can't take the heat; he's gonna sing like a canary. Then we're all gonna take the fall for what we did.
Butters
[walks up] Ha-ey fellas. [Cartman and Kenny avoid eye contact with Butters]
Stan
Butters. [looks down, then away, then sniffs, then clears his throat. After a while, Butters just walks off]
Cartman
[a few seconds later] Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
Stan
So what should we do?
Cartman
We have no choice. We have to kill Kyle.
Stan
[just looks at Cartman] ... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Cartman
Why not?
Stan
Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?
Cartman
He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. [walks off]
South Park Police Department.
Cashier
You wanted to see me, Officer Barbrady?
Officer Barbrady
Yes, thanks for coming, Mr. Bell. A house was TP'ed in South Park and I need to see if you can identify the toilet paper I recovered from the scene. [walks up to a body bag] I'm... sorry I have to do this. [unzips the bag and recoils with Bell at the apparent foul odor. They both cough]
Mr. Bell
Oh my God.
Officer Barbrady
Is this toilet paper from your store?
Mr. Bell
It's... difficult to tell, it's... so decayed, I... wait a minute, yes. Yes, I recognize the floral pattern now.
Officer Barbrady
[takes out the tape recorder, turns it on, and speaks into it] Positive ID on the toilet paper. [turns it off and puts it away]
Mr. Bell
Who would... do this to toilet paper? Who?
Officer Barbrady
Mr. Bell, do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days?
Mr. Bell
Suspicious like how?
Officer Barbrady
Well, like someone who was black or Mexican or Middle Eastern.
Mr. Bell
Nnoo, the only Mexican guy I recall bought toasted tarts and chips and... we don't allow Middle Eastern people in the store. [arrives at a realization] Oh my God! [vomits]
Stark's Pond, night. A low fog moves over the surface of the water.
Kyle
What's this all about, Cartman?
Cartman
I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
Kyle
A boat ride?
Cartman
I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
Kyle
Well, okay.
Cartman
Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat? [Kyle walks over and helps Cartman load the block and chain onto the boat. Kyle then hops in. Cartman retrieves a bat, loads it onto the boat, and hops in. The boat begins to float away from the shore.] Okay, let's go. [starts to row. The boat heads for the middle of the pond, and eerie music plays] So how are things, Kyle?
Kyle
Terrible. Every time I close my eyes I see the house we TP'ed. I see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters.
Cartman
And you feel like you have to confess.
Kyle
I don't know what to do. [Cartman reaches for the bat while Kyle has his back to him] Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now. [Cartman takes aim] Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before. [Cartman moves the bat around, measuring Kyle] So cold. The world can feel like that. [Cartman moves forward, ready to whack him] So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens. [Cartman takes a whack at Kyle's head, but all Kyle does is blink] Ow. [rubs his head and turns around] What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
Cartman
I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. [whacks him again]
Kyle
Cartman!
Cartman
Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. [whacks him twice more]
Kyle
You wanna kill me?! Fine! [turns around and crosses his arms] I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! [Cartman lowers the bat and thinks a bit, then resumes whacking Kyle. Once. Then eight more times.]
Cartman
Won't be long, Kyle. [whacks him three more times.]
Juvenile Hall, day. Barbrady returns to Cell Block 4.
Officer Barbrady
Josh, I need your help.
Josh
The answer is right in front of you, but you can't see it.
Officer Barbrady
How do you mean?
Josh
Tell me, the toilet paper. Was it quilted?
Officer Barbrady
Yes.
Josh
Single-sheet?
Officer Barbrady
No, two-ply. [Josh closes his eyes and thinks hard] What? What does that tell you?
Josh
Why does one toilet-paper houses
Officer Barbrady
To get revenge.
Josh
No, that is incidental. Your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teacher's house, thus transforming her entire occupation.
Officer Barbrady
What do you mean?
Josh
Your uncle, who hit you with a belt. Was he a large man?
Officer Barbrady
I don't have time for this, kid.
Josh
Did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin' down at the pool house?
Officer Barbrady
Alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles' laps! [cries uncontrollably]
Josh
Whoa. Uh, oh. Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teacher's class, students who aren't very good at art.
Officer Barbrady
Oh. Of course! One of her students!
Josh
Fly along now, Officer Barbrady. You've got some arrests to make. [turns around and whispers to himself] Fly fly flyyy. Fly fly flyyy.
Warden
[arrives at Josh's cell] Josh, [the smile vanishes from Josh's face] were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again?
Josh
[normal voice] No, sir.
Stark's pond, night. Cartman is still whacking away at Kyle, in vain. Stan and Kenny come up in a pedal-powered boat. Both of them are pedaling. Stan looks over.
Stan
Cartman, what are you doing?
Cartman
I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
Stan
You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
Cartman
They did?
Kyle
They did?
Stan
They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
Kyle
Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
Cartman
But can I still kill Kyyyle?
South Park Police Department, day. The boys head for the station and enter.
Dialog
Officer Barbrady
Hello boys. How are you?
Stan
We heard that you have the person who TP'ed the art teacher's house? Is that true?
Officer Barbrady
It sure is!
Cartman
Uh, can we see them-him-her?
Officer Barbrady
Right over here. [takes the boys over to the one jail cell] Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. [the boys turn right to see the suspect]
Butters
Hey fellas!
Stan
Butters?
Butters
Yep. I'm in jail.
Kyle
You con-fessed?
Butters
Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP'ed the art teacher's house. [thoughtful] I don't seem to remember it, [normal] but they're pretty sure it was me. [approaches the bars and grabs them] I just can't get my behavior under control!
!Officer Barbrady
His parents are on their way down now.
Butters
Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
Kyle
[turns away, and the other boys huddle around him] You guys, we can't let him do this!
Cartman
What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
Butters
Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
Kyle
Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.
Officer Barbrady
Why do you say that?
Kyle
Because it was-
Cartman
[rushes up and intervenes] Wiffle ball, anyone? [glares at Kyle] Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
Butters
You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
Officer Barbrady
All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.
South Park Police Department, outside. The boys leave the station.
Cartman
You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
Kyle
I still feel bad, Cartman
Cartman
What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
Kyle
Yeah. That makes it even worse.
Cartman
Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
Kyle
I know.
Cartman
So... so then, how can you feel bad?
Stan
He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.
Cartman
...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
Stan
It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad. [to Kyle] I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
Kenny
(Yeah, maybe we should.)
Cartman
What?? Eh... [tries to be upbeat] hey you guys! There's nothing to feel bad about! We're, we're off scot-free!
Kyle
We feel bad for other people.
Cartman
[looks at the other boys in disbelief] For oth-er... [winces] Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
Stan
Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do. [points an accusing finger at Cartman] And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! [He, Kyle, and Kenny leave]
Cartman
Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
South Park Police Department. The Stotches arrive at the police station and charge in.
Stephen
Well well well! I had to see it to believe it! [approaches the jail cell]
Butters
Hi, Dad.
Stephen
Don't you "Hi, Dad" me! Look at you! Standing behind prison bars! Again!
Butters
Yeah.
Linda
What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn't toilet-paper that house!
Officer Barbrady
Huh??
Stephen
Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady.
Linda
Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn't commit?! We have had it, mister!
Butters
Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
Stephen
And that's your excuse?!
Officer Barbrady
Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I'd better let you out now. [goes to the cell door and opens it]
Stephen
Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!
Butters
[steps back from the door] Officer, can I stay in jail, please?
The woods near Stark's Pond, evening. Eric appears and calls out to people behind him.
Cartman
Come on, you guys! Hurry! [steps forward and looks back to his friends] Guys, hurry!
Stan
[appears] What is it, Cartman? [Kyle and Kenny trail Stan]
Cartman
It's over this way! Come on!
Stark's Pond, later. Cartman rows the small boat to the middle of the lake, as he did before with Kyle. Lonely music plays, as before.
Cartman
So how are things, guys?
Stan
Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
Cartman
I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
Kyle
You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
Cartman
Can't I? [pulls out the Wiffle ball bat and starts whacking the other three. They just look at each other.]
South Park Elementary, next day. Officer Barbrady enters the principal's office.
Officer Barbrady
Excuse me, everyone. [Mr. Mackey and Mrs. Streibel turn around. Principal Victoria sits at her desk] I have someone with me who can tell us all who toilet-papered the art teacher's house! [the door opens and Josh is rolled in tied up to a dolly by a policeman. He quickly looks to his left] Josh insisted he be able to tell you the names of the toilet paperers in person. [on top of a file cabinet near the door is a roll of toilet paper. Josh smiles]
Mr. Mackey
Uh, that's nice, Officer Barbrady, but we actually don't need to know-
Kyle
[rushes in] Hold it! [Stan and Kenny rush in behind him] Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streibel. We have something we need to tell you.
Principal Victoria
All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?
Josh
What's the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive? Did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass?
Principal Victoria
[pointing] Get him out of here!
Officer Barbrady
Uh, Policeman Brown, will you take Josh outside, please?
Josh
[being rolled out] Ooh, Policeman Brown, never quite made officer. Why is that, Policeman Brown? [the roll of toilet paper is now gone...]
Kyle
We have to confess that we were the ones that-
Mr. Mackey
It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything.
Stan
You, you do? How?
Cartman
[steps forward from the back of the room] Hi guys.
Kyle
Cartman??
Cartman
I told them everything, you guys. It's over.
Principal Victoria
Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.
Cartman
My consciences just caught up with me.
Kyle
That's not fair!
Mr. Mackey
You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave.
Kyle
But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
Officer Barbrady
Well, I guess my work here is done. After all this, I'm gonna need a long vacation. [turns and exits the room]
Kyle
This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
South Park Elementary, hallway outside the principal's office.
Officer Barbrady
Okay, Josh, time to go back to the... [sees Policeman Brown covered in toilet paper and Josh's dolly empty] Oh no!
Policeman Brown
He... He was too fast for me. He ran out the door!
Officer Barbrady
Couldn't you have gone after him?
Policeman Brown
Well, ah I'm covered in toilet paper. I'd look silly.
South Park Elementary cafeteria, after school. Mr. Mackey addresses the detained. The boys are there, as well as two of the sixth graders, and Craig and Bebe.
Mr. Mackey
Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?
Stan
Wugh! Two weeks of this!
Kyle
Yeah. But I have to say, I feel a lot better now.
Cartman
I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
Kyle
Oh Jesus! [buries his face in his hands, then raises it as Cartman talks]
Cartman
I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
Kyle
You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
Cartman
Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
Kyle
Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
Cartman
Hm.
South Park Police Department, afternoon. Barbrady stands at his desk. The phone rings and he answers it.
Officer Barbrady
Police station.
Josh
[over the earpiece] Hello Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
Josh? Josh, where are you?!
An undisclosed location, day.
Josh
I'm afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom, officer. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell.
South Park Police Department.
Officer Barbrady
Josh, you have to go back to Juvenile Hall. You only have a three-week sentence.
Washington DC, day.
Josh
Sorry, officer, gotta run. There's something I've been meaning to do for quite some time. Ciao. [hangs up. Next to him are two boxes full of toilet paper. He picks them up and leaves the phone. The camera zooms out to reveal the location to be a park across the street from the White House. Josh heads for the White House, but stops at the curb to gaze at it.]
End of Toilet Paper

I'm a Little Bit Country
South Park Elementary, day. The bell rings. The fourth graders are still chatting as Mr. Garrison enters.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?
Mr. Slave
[at his own little desk off to the side] All donesy wunsy. [has a clipboard to prove it]
Mr. Garrison
Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problem.
Cartman
[searching his notebook] Math homework, Math homework. Where did I file that?
Mr. Garrison
[about to write on the board, but turns around] Oh, and by the way, children, there's a walkout scheduled today to protest the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against the war, run along outside, and if you're for the war, uh, stay here and we'll do math problems. [the kids quickly stare at each other]
South Park Elementary, front entrance. The door open and all the kids run out. A cloud of paper signals their exit. Some of them twirl with delight. The boys come out singing.
The Boys
We got out of schoo-l! No more school toda-ay!
Kyle
What should we do?
Stan
Let's go see a movie! [they stop in their tracks as they hear "No war! No war!"]
Protesters
No war! No war! [a sea of them mill around on South Park Avenue waving various signs around] No war! No war! [One man wields an American flag. He lowers it while another reaches for a lighter and set the flag aflame.] No war! No war! [three men break into Tele's through its large window and steal various TVs] No war! No war! No war!
Mr. Mackey
[walks up to the boys with several signs in his hands] No war, m'kay?! No war, m'kay?! Oh uh, here you go, boys. [hands each of them a sign] These will help you protest. It's good to see that you care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war, m'kay?!
A voice
Excuse me, boys. [the boys look and the adult is shown] Tom Stansel, HBC news. Can you kids tell me why you marched out of school today? [behind him is the cameraman and an assistant, and behind her, the news van]
Stan
[pause] Uh... war?
Tom
Right. What about the war?
Kyle
[pause] Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
Tom
Uh huh, and what aspect of it do you think is most gay?
Kyle
[looks at his sign] Uuuh, n-no blood for oil.
Stan
Yeah. [the mic moves back to him as he looks at his sign] War is not my voice.
Cartman
[reading Kenny's sign] Bush is a Naizi
Skeeter
[arrives with a crowd] Hey all you un-American bastards! If you don't like America, why don't you git out?! [moves his right thumb in front of his shoulder and to his right. With him are Jimbo, Ned, Stuart, and Craig's father Tom]
Mr. Mackey
Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay?
Protesters
Yeah! Right!
Stuart
If the Founding Fathers saw you burning your flag an' callin' the President a Nazi, they'd roll over in their grave!
Supporters
Yeah! Right!
Randy
The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
Skeeter
Foundin' Fathers would kick all your asses!
Tom
Boys, what do you think the Founding Fathers would say?
Cartman
...Eh the... Founding who? [seconds later, both sides rush each other and attack]
South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom. He stares at the children angrily, his arms crossed.
Mr. Garrison
[drops his arm, putting his right hand on his hip] Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves! [crosses his arms again] Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!
Butters
Mmuh well, not really, no.
Mr. Garrison
Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!
Class
Awwwwww!
Mr. Garrison
SHUT UP! I want you all in your study groups of four, and if you can't give an outstanding report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about all this protesting, then it's Fs for you! [walks off]
South Park Elementary, Garrison's classroom, moments later. The class has separated in groups of four and five. Group 1: Jimmy, Red, Clyde, Bebe, Wendy. Group 2: Butters, Jordan, Kevin, Token. Group 3: Cartman, Kenny, Stan, Kyle. Group 4: Tweek, Pip, blond boy, Craig, another boy. All are studying quietly. Camera angle moves from the front of the room to the side of the room opposite the door.
Cartman
[beginning to slack off] Ugh. Ughuh. [tries to resume studying, but his eyes grow heavy. He panics] I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! [yawns loudly and promptly sleeps on his book]
Kyle
[smacks Cartman] Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
Cartman
But you guys are such better studiers than me. I know you can pull it off.
Stan
[pointing] You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
Cartman
Maaaa. M-maaaa.
Kyle
[annoyed] SHUT UP AND STUDY!
Cartman
Maaaa. Mah mah mh. [reluctantly returns to reading. He begins to fidget, then reads more, then fidgets again, turns the page, fidgets once more, then just thinks] Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days? [repeats the question, his voice fading at each repetition] In those days? In those days? In those days?
Kyle
[noticing] What are you doing?
Cartman
I'm trying to have a flashback.
Kenny
(A what?)
Cartman
You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
Stan
No, you just have to study.
Cartman
No. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second. [thinks] Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then? [repeats the last two words, his voice fading at each repetition] Back then? Back then? Back then? [nothing happens. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at him] Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me. [his voice begins to fade and he begins moving his hands around like a pantomime. The camera closes in] With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
Kyle
That isn't gonna work, dumbass!
Mr. Slave
Kids, let's keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.
Stan
[from behind his book] Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
Cartman
[throws a fit] Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!
South Park Avenue. The opposing groups face each other in front of the tallest building in town. Skeeter paints a line across the span of the street and looks up.
Skeeter
There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that's the unpatriotic side. [the war supporters begin to clamor]
Randy
How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!
Protesters
Hahahaha, yeah.
Jimbo
You just keep all your flag burnin' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side of the town!
Protester
Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office.
Stuart
Well your side has the grocery store.
Jimbo
Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.
Gerald
Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?
Jimbo
W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that. Just like ...we could cross the line for hardware, supplies, gas, and pharmaceutical needs.
Townsfolk
Yup, yes sir, yeah, right, uh huh.
Skeeter
Hey everybody, this is never going to work. Don't you see? All this dividin' up the town, it's just ridiculous. What we really should be doing, is just beatin' the hell out of each other like we were.
Randy
He's right. [looks at Sheila] Boy, do I feel like a fool. [moments later, both sides attack each other again. Among the skirmishes: Kenny's mom attacks Gerald, Sheila attacks Ned]
Cartman's house, upstairs. The boys walk down the hallway and reach Cartman's room. He's rigged up a way to ... knock himself out. Three pulley wheels and a nail guide a string tied to the door across the entrance, up the wall, and back to the top of the door entrance. At the other end of the string is a big rock.
Kyle
Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're supposed to be studying! [the boys stop at the entrance to Cartman's room]
Cartman
That's what I'm doing. I'm about to find out all about what happened back in 1776. [tests the tautness of the string]
Stan
How?!
Cartman
All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
Kyle
Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
Cartman
Haha, make fun of me all you want, Kyle! But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, Kenny looks at them. They clear the doorway. Kyle stands on one side, Stan and Kenny on the other. Cartman backs up, clears his throat, then begins to walk with purpose] Oh Gee. I wonder what it used to be like in the year 1776. [trips the string. The rock immediately falls on his head, knocking him out. He moans a few times.]
Kyle
Cartman? Cartman?? [the boys gather around Cartman. Kyle turns him over.]
Cartman
Benjamin Franklin?
Kyle
No, turdpants, it's Kyle!
Cartman
[touches Kyle, then in a weak raspy voice] Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
City Hall, day. Both sides of the war issue are in the office.
Townsfolk
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Mayor McDaniels
Okay, people. What are we rambling about now?
Randy
[steps forward] Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.
Skeeter
[steps forward, past a few war supporters] That's bullcrap, Mayor! Our rally to support the war was set up months ago!
Gerald
There was no war months ago!
Skeeter
Hey, if you don't like America, then you can git out!
Randy
Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music propaganda!
Stuart
Well nobody wants to hear a bunch o' rock protest songs! [both side begin to clamor again]
Mr. Mackey
Well up yours, rednecks!
Townsfolk
Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble! Rabble!
Mayor McDaniels
Quiet people! The town square is public space. That means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally, I'll just have to give the town square to both groups.
Jimbo
All right, that's fine! Because our war support songs will be a thousand times better!
Randy
Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!
Skeeter
We'll trizzle the shizzle all over the hizzle!
Gerald
Yeah?! See you Saturday, makizzer shanna sharilla shaz biuznatch gazizzah!
Cartman's house, night. The front door opens and in walk the boys.
Stan
Cartman?
Kyle
Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! [there's debris all over the living room. The boys arrive at Cartman hanging from a candy-cane colored swing set with the swings removed. Beneath him is a tub of water. Cartman has it rigged so that he pulls a string, which releases him and at the same time triggers a sledgehammer, which hits a box, which is supposed to land in the tub with him.]
Cartman
Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
Stan
Oh no...
Cartman
Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Founding Fathers!
Kyle
Cartman, you're supposed to be studying! What the hell is all this?!
Cartman
I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
Stan
Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
Cartman
Or a really sweet one. [a bell is heard]
TV OH
Your Tivo is full.
Cartman
Whoa, here it goes! [triggers the sledgehammer as he falls. Both he and the TiVo land in the tub, and the house shorts out. Cartman is electrocuted as he lands in the water. The boys spend a few seconds in the darkness looking at Cartman, wondering if he'll come to. Kenny turns and walks away slowly]
Kyle
Cartman? [no response] Cartman??
Stan
Aww crap.
The flashback. Cartman is seen in period dress, face down on a dirt road. He comes to, looks up, sits up and looks around, then notices his clothes. He quickly rises and looks at Philadelphia in the distance.
Cartman
Ohhh awesome!!! [a horse-drawn carriage approaches, driven by a teenage boy.]
Driver
Worthy young lad, are you all right?
Cartman
Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
Driver
This year? Why it's 1776, it is.
Cartman
Oho yes! I did it I did it!
Driver
Would you like a ride into town? I'm on my way to Master Thomas Jefferson's house to get a very important document, I am.
Cartman
Oho kick fucking ass, dude! [approaches the carriage and climbs up to sit alongside the driver]
Driver
Never seen you around here, friend. Might you be from up North?
Cartman
No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
Driver
A flashback? Why, what is that?
Cartman
Well you know, it's a... [points at something] H-ho, awesome! [they've entered the town and Cartman begins to sing.]

Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.
With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.
What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me
I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.
Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.

Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's recovery room. Cartman's mom sits by his bed as Stan and Kyle look on. Dr. Doctor enters.
Liane
[jumps up worried] Is he going to be all right, doctor??
Dr. Doctor
Your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion I've never seen before. His chances of surviving are very slim. I'm so sorry.
Liane
[quickly returns to embrace him, with emotion in her voice.] Oh baby baby, you can't die.
Kyle
Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! [shakes him hard]
Liane
Whoa. Easy, Kyle.
Kyle
But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
Stan
I guess we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
Liane
I know you're in a very dark place now, sweetie. But you must come toward the light! Come toward the light!
Flashback, night. The driver and Cartman approach Jefferson's house.
Driver
Here we are, then. The current residence of Master Thomas Jefferson.
Cartman
Super neato! [both driver and Cartman disboard and walk towards the door]
Driver
[stops and turns] I'm afraid you'll have to wait here.
Cartman
But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
Driver
Sorry. Only the official messenger boy is allowed to talk to Mister Jefferson
Cartman
Oh, okay.I guess I understand. [the driver walks off. Cartman notices some firewood and picks up a log of it, then follows the driver while singing to himself]

I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...[he quickly assaults the driver and beats him with the log, then drags the body away and returns to the Jefferson residence, knocking on the door]
I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...

Jefferson
Hello. I am Thomas Jefferson.
Cartman
And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
Jefferson
[holding a document] Very well. Take this document to the Continental Congress. [hands it to Cartman]
Cartman
[beholding it] Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
Jefferson
Some favor going to war with England and others want to avoid war at all cost.
Cartman
It's a bitch, ain't it?
Jefferson
Perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all. Good luck, young messenger! [Cartman turns and heads for the carriage] Now make haste!
Stan's house, day. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny study at the coffee table in the living room.
Stan
Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
Protesters
[first heard, then seen as they enter from screen left] No war! No war! No war!
Kyle
Oh, Jesus...
Randy
Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.
Stan
Dad, we have to study. Mr. Garrison is making us do a presentation on what the Founding Fathers would say about the war.
Mr. Mackey
Hey... That's a terrific idea!
Gerald
Yeah! We could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on Saturday!
Stan
Oh, no, nononono.
Supporters
[first heard, then they enter through the front door] Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops!
Skeeter
See? I told you they had your son.
Stuart
Kenny. What are you doing over here with all these un-American traitors?!
Kenny
(I'm doing my homework.)
Randy
The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! [the war supporters clamor against Randy]
Stan
Actually, we hadn't really come to a decision-
Stuart
Look! My son is a patriot and LOVES his country! [grabs Kenny's jacket] Come on, Kenny!
Kenny
(But Dad, I-)
Stuart
NOW!
Skeeter
Yeah!
Supporters
Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! Support our troops! [they walk out the front door. Kenny follows his dad out. Stan follows him ]
Stan
[stops at the open door] Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww. [turns around and returns to the table] Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
Kyle
[shoves his book off the table] God damnit!
Randy
Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
Gerald
Disgraceful! Stan and Kyle, it's up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the Founding Fathers agree with us!
Protester 1
Yeah, that's right!
Protester 2
Come on, guys!
Protester 3
Get back to work!
Kyle
Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
Philadelphia, day. Independence Hall is shown. Cartman enters and finds the Congress room. The doors open before him.
A voice
Enter, young messenger. [Cartman enters the room, awed by the people he sees around him, and approaches the main desk. He hands the document to the man waiting there] I am John Hancock, President of the Congress.
Cartman
Wow.
Hancock
Mr. John Adams?
Adams
Aye. [rises and approaches the table]
Hancock
Will you do the honors of reading the document to Congress, please? [Cartman takes an empty chair nearby]
Adams
[reading from the Declaration] WHEN in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one Penis to rise up- [cut to the end of the Declaration] -we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.P.S. - Every Thursday should be Free Ice Cream Day. [rolls up the Declaration. Cartman looks around]
A Congressman
Excuse me, but does this Declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with England?
Adams
We have no choice, Mr. Dickinson. [chatter erupts]
South Park, day. The town square stage. On stage are decorations for the two sides. On the left is a large peace sign on a green curtain surrounded by peace signs and protest signs, on the right is a large eagle surrounded by yellow ribbons. Both groups are on stage.
Mr. Mackey
All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? [people within the crowd clap. Randy comes out dressed in an Elvis outfit].
Skeeter
Don't kid yourselves. These people have come out to support our troops, right?! [raises a fist. Other people within the crowd clap]
Mr. Mackey
And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war.
Skeeter
Oh no you don't! We're doing our pro-war song first!
Jimbo
Yeah! The last thing these people want is a bleedin'-heart rock protest song!
Mayor McDaniels
[intervenes] People, I told you, you have to share the stage.
Randy
Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
Skeeter
Well excuse me if... 
I'm a little bit country.
Randy
Well I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!
Skeeter
I'm a little for supportin' our troops.
Randy
And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
Skeeter
I believe freedom isn't free.
Randy
No, but war shouldn't be our goal.
Skeeter
We must defend our country.
Randy
If it means war, then we say NO!
Somebody
Yeehaw!
Skeeter
[walks to the edge of the stage in front of the war support crowd, then sits on the edge]

Did you forget them towers in New York?
Did you forget how it made you feel
To see them towers come down?
Were you like me? Did you think it weren't real?

Randy
I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! 
The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!
Skeeter
We got GPS, ICBMs, and good old-fashioned lead. 
We're gonna show Saddam what America means; that son of a bitch'll be dead.
Randy
Why are we fightin' this war?
There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.
They didn't give me a choice.
War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!

Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There's plenty of argument going on.
Adams
We must go to war!
Dickinson
But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.
Congressman 1
England will only understand one thing: Force.
Congressman 2
[rises] I must state again for the record that South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia are against war! [pounds the table with his fist]
Congressman 3
Yeah, because you don't care about the fate of the Colonies like we do! You're all unpatriotic! And if you don't like the Colonies, then you can get out!
Dickinson
Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them don't want! [the various Congressmen begin babbling with each other]
Cartman
[observing] Whoa, how very very relevant.
South Park, day, town square. The rally is still going on, and a reporter files the following report.
Tom
Tom, I'm standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours. The crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music, and the other half rock-n-roll. Let's listen in.
Mr. Mackey
And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war. [Stan walks up to the mic, watching the crowd on the way there. Kyle follows. The crowd claps appreciatively]
Protesters
Booooo!!
Randy
[steps up] For you people who still think war is the answer, perhaps you can listen to the voices ... of the children. [shows them off and backs out of the scene. The crowd applauds and quiets down]
Stan
Uh, we didn't do it.
Mr. Mackey
What?
Kyle
We didn't do our homework.
Sharon
Boys! You were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the Founding Fathers!
Stan
Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Daylight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
Skeeter
That's because the Founding Fathers would have supported the war!
Mr. Mackey
The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!
Supporters
Support!
Protesters
Protest!
Supporters
Country!
Protesters
Rock-n-roll!
The two sides charge at each other on stage, then off stage. They attack each other with their signs. One man drives his "War is not my voice" sign straight down into another man's head. A man drives his "Bush is a Nazi" sign up a woman's nose after she swats him with her "Support Your Troops" sign. A woman strikes someone else down with her "No Blood for Oil" sign. Stan and Kyle just look on.
Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There's plenty of argument still going on.
Congressmen
Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!
Dickinson
We cannot found a country based on war!
Adams
We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!
Congressman
Rabble!
Congressmen
Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble! [the doors open and in walks an august figure. The boisterous voices become hushed] Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. [they keep murmuring this as Franklin walks towards the main desk]
Cartman
Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
Hancock
Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?
Franklin
I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both?
Jefferson
Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time.
Dickinson
Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it.
Franklin
And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless.
Adams
[holding a slice of chocolate cake] It's like having your cake, and eating it, too.
Congressman 2
Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another.
Hancock
And we will call that country the United States of America.
Cartman
Wow, I get it now! I get it! [senses his flashback coming to an end] Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
Hell's Pass Hospital, day, Cartman's room. Cartman comes to and looks around.
Cartman
Wow!
South Park, town square. The townsfolk are still attacking each other and killing more of their number. One man kills another with a "PEACE NOW" sign. A war supporter runs a flag pole through a protester, then pulls it back out again. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny watch from the other end of the square, towards the stage as the carnage continues.
Cartman
[appears on stage in his hospital gown, his hair disheveled] Everyone, stop! Please! [everyone stops and looks at him]
Townsman
The-the child! The child, from the hospital.
Cartman
If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
Stan
He does? [he and Kyle are shocked]
Kyle
He does?
Cartman
I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn't want to. [a shot of the crowd]
Cartman
You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having your cake and eating it too."
Randy
He's right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.
Skeeter
Yeah, but... if it weren't for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.
Gerald
And if it weren't for you people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.
Mr. Mackey
I guess we... owe you an apology.
Stuart
Eh-ah, I guess we owe you one.
Townsfolk
Awww. [amid a chorus of awwws they hug each other.]
Kyle
Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
Stan
Can't be
Cartman
The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
Skeeter
Hey I'm a little bit country
Randy
And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH! 
Cartman takes his mic and backs out of the scene, leaving Randy and Skeeter to sing together.
Skeeter
I'll be the muscle of America
Randy
And me, I'll be the caring soul.
Together
And when you put us together you get a nation with one goal 
To thrive and prosper, with a little country and rock and roll.

Randy
Come on up here, everybody! [the crowd surges onto the stage. Stan and Kyle look dumbfounded]
Everybody
We're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll
Stuart
We can be a nation that believes in war.
Mr. Mackey
And still tells the world that we don't. 
[moments later the back of the stage begins to rise, revealing guests from many previous episodes]

Everybody
Let the flag for hypocrisy fly high from every pole 
Cuz we're a little bit country, and we're a little bit rock-n-roll.

Randy
Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
Skeeter
We want to thank our guests, the pro-war people. [shown, including Halfy. Some applause is heard] And the anti-war people. [shown. Some applause is heard]
Stan
What the hell are they doing now?
Kyle
[covers his nose and shuts his eyes tight] I-I don't know.
Everybody
For the war, against, the war, WHO CARES?? One hundred episodes! 
Randy and Skeeter perform some nifty footwork as they finish the song.
Kyle
I hate this town. I-I really really do.
End of I'm a Little Bit Country

Fat Butt and Pancake Head
South Park Elementary, day. Kyle is speaking to the school in the school gym, which is nicely decorated in the flags of many nations, both on the rafters and on the small stage set up at one end of the basketball court.
Kyle
[wearing an argyle sweater] ...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. [cheers from the school crowd before him]
Principal Victoria
[approaches the mic] Okay, thank you, Kyle Broflovski.
Mr. Mackey
[as Kyle approaches him] That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. [a shot of the council, which is comprised of five Latinos. ]
Kyle
Cool.
Principal Victoria
All right, students, members of the school board. Our last speaker will discuss the important role of Latinos in the arts. Here is... Eric Cartman. [reads again in disbelief] Eric Cartman? [a smattering of applause from the kids in the crowd]
Cartman
[approaches the mic with his left hand behind his back] Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
Kids
Jennifer Lopez?
Kyle
No way.
Cartman
[shows off his left hand, which is open] Miss Lopez, come on out here. [the hand closes to become a fist, and that fist has a face and hair painted on it]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[Cartman begins to speak in a Spanish cartoon accent and his lips form a tiny smile as his hand begins to move] Hallooo. [the hand sports a small wig and a paper cutout of a woman's body hanging down from it. The cutout wears a white top and shorts and a heavy brown coat. The cutout's right hand sports some yellow bracelets]
Principal Victoria
[taken aback] Oh, Jesus Christ.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
My name is Hennifer Lopez. I eat tacos, y burritos.
Cartman
Ms. Lopez, would you like to talk about Latinos and the arts?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh si, si. But first I would like to put on my pretty dress.
Cartman
Oh, you mean this one? [whips out a doll's dress for the occasion]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh si si si. I like it very much.
Cartman
[fits the dress under his hand] There we go, Saright?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Saright.
Cartman
That's a very pretty dress. [the Latino Endowment Council is shown again]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
It better be! I am Hennifer Lopez!
Cartman
Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
si si. [enunciating] Hennifer Lopez!
Cartman
Nono, Jeh-
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Heh-
Cartman
Jeh-
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Heh-
Cartman
Jeh
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Jeh
Cartman
Jennifer Lopez.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Hennifer Lopez [members of the council laugh and clap]
A Council Member
Hahahahaha, oh my.
Cartman
Ms. Lopez, could you show everyone your example of Latino arts?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Don't be fooled by all my money. I still like to eat tacos, honey. So crispy on the outside, so super good and yummy.
Cartman
And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. [Much more cheer and applause for him. The school gives him a standing ovation. The members of the Latino Endowment council jump up and down with joy and pride. Stan and Kenny clap with everyone else, Kyle is just stunned.]
South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down one side inside the mall. Cartman leads the way.
Cartman
Oh-hoh man! A twenty-dollar gift certificate at the mall! I can buy whatever I want! Cultural Diversity Day kicks ass!
Kyle
It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
Cartman
Hey, I spent weeks preparing too, Kyle.
Kyle
No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
Cartman
[walks up to Kyle] Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Aww, that makes me muy triste.
Cartman
Ms. Lopez, do you like Kyle?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh si si, very much.
Cartman
Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh si, si si, my kisses taste like tacos. [Cartman plants his fist on Kyle's lips and makes kissing noises, then removes the hand]
Cartman
Is nice?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Is very nice. He's so handsome. [Cartman puts the hand back on Kyle's mouth and resumes the kissing noises]
Kyle
[swats Cartman's hand away]Stop it!
Cartman
Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
Kenny
(Woohoo!) [the boys go to the food court]
South Park Mall, later. The boys walk down the mall. Cartman's hand is finishing off a taco as he looks at it.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Mmm, tacos! So yummy!
Kyle
Stop wasting the tacos on your hand, Cartman!
Cartman
Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
Kyle
She's not eating it, it's just coming out her backside!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
When you eat a taco it comes out your backside too, cholo!
Kenny
(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Look look! Make your own music video! [they stop in front of a "U R Da Star", a music-video shop]
Kyle
Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
Cartman
I agree. Those places are stupid.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
It's not stupid. I need to make music video.
Stan
[to Cartman's hand] Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand? [slaps Cartman's hand down] Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
Cartman
Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[rises] Just wait one minute, let me see how much it is. [leads Cartman in. Stan and Kenny follow]
Kyle
God dammit! [follows reluctantly]
Cashier
Welcome to Make Your Own Video. All set to rock and roll?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
How much to make a video?
Cashier
Uh, well, it's nine ninety five for a three-minute tape.
Cartman
Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh please! Come on, guys!
Kyle
Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
Cartman
All right all right, here's ten dollars! [takes out the bill and hands it to the cashier]
Kyle
That's not what I meant!
Cashier
All right, just come over here and stand in front of the green screen. [Cartman walks over to the screen] What kind of song do you want?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Something hot and spicy.
The cashier puts on various music tracks, first song is a rock song.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Spicier.
Next is Latin song
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Spicierrr!
Next song is a Latin mix. This is agreeable, so the video is made.
"Jennifer Lopez: Taco-Flavored Kisses" is shown, The hand has its costume on hanging down from it.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Burrito. Taco taco. Burrito. Taco. Taco taco.
Don't think that just because I got a lot of money
I'll give you taco-flavored kisses, honey!
Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.
Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.

Cashier
You know, I've seen a lot of videos here at the mall, and that was by far the best!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh, gracias, "Machel"! [the cashier's tag reads "Michael"]
Cashier
Hey, I've got a friend who's interning at a big record label in L.A. I'll send a copy on to him and maybe he'll get the bigwigs to see it.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh, gracias, Machel, gracias!
Kyle
Can we go now, please?!
Cartman
Yeah, I wanna leave.
Kyle
Stop it, Cartman!
Cartman
What?
BHI records, L.A. day. The tape is being played on a massive screen in an office.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.
Taco taco.
BHI President
She's fantastic. Who is she? [two men sit on a sofa, one sits on an armchair]
Aide 1
[with brown hair] Believe it or not, her name is Jennifer Lopez.
Aide 2
[in armchair] That makes sense. She reminds me of J-Lo.
BHI President
Yeah, but she's younger and spicier.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Taco taco. Burrito Burri...to. Taco taco.
Aide 2
I don't think J-Lo would like it very much if we signed this new girl.
BHI President
No, you're right. We're gonna have to fire J-Lo.
Cartman's house, day. The phone rings in the kitchen and he answers it.
Cartman
Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. [hands the phone to "her"]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh, si si siiih. Allo!

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh my God I can't believe it!!!
Cartman
[puts the phone to his ear] Hello, are you still there?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
They want to sign me to the record company!
Cartman
You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh my God, it's happening for me!
Cartman
Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!! [hangs up and grins] We're gonna be rich!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
We're gonna be famose!
Cartman
Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! [runs off]
Cartman's house, night. Cartman is on his bed writing away on a notepad.
Cartman
There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh, si si siiih.
Cartman
[scoots back to his bedside lamp and turns it off, then settles under the covers] Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. [rubs off her open eyes and paints some closed lids on his hand.]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Ohh, I'm so sleeeepyyy.
Cartman
Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow... [begins to dream of taunting Kyle] Tomorrow...
His dream begins at the bus stop
Cartman
"Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!" [in class, sitting next to each other] "You were wrong, Kyle!" [in the cafeteria, as Kyle walks by with his lunch] "Nananananaaana!" [on the bus ride home] "Hahahahahaaaha!" [images of Kyle come forth, crying] "Nananananaaana!" "Hahahahahaaaha!" [in his sleep] Awesommme. Yeeessss.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[has dreams of its own] Aaahhhh. Aaahhhh.
An Oscar ceremony. Two Oscars stand guard over a red carpet. On either side of the carpet is a crowd of people. A limo pulls up and a hand floats out of it.
Man 1
Ms. Lopez! Up here!
Man 2
Jennifer, We love you Jennifer!
Man 3
Jennifer, over here.
Man 4
Jennifer!
A concert. Her first single is thumping away, and she appears as just a hand, floating over the stage floor.
Female fan
[stageside] We love you Jennifer! [roses land onstage. Shots of three magazines follow.]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[back to Cartman's room] Aaahhhh.
BHI Records, Los Angeles, day. The president and his men are in a meeting when he looks up.
BHI President
Ah, Ms. Lopez, come on in.
Jennifer Lopez
[carrying a toy poodle takes a seat and removes her glasses] Yo, make it quick. I got a video shoot at two and a script reading at five.
BHI President
Yes, well uh, Ms. Lopez, we regret to inform you that, uh... we're dropping you from the label.
Jennifer Lopez
What? Oh no you di'n't!
Aide 1
We wanna thank you for all your hard work and ..."talent".
Jennifer Lopez
[pounds her table] You can't drop me! I'm Jennifer Lopez! How can you drop me?!
BHI President
Wu-well a very talented younger singer has come to our attention and, and the truth of the matter is her name happens to be Jennifer Lopez as well. And we really can't have two here at BHI Records.
Jennifer Lopez
Who the hell is this other Jennifer Lopez?! Where is she come from?!
Aide 1
Well, she lives in South Park, Colorado now, but uh I believe she originally from Mexico, just like you.
Jennifer Lopez
I don't come from no Mexico! I'm Puer'ah Rican!
BHI President
Whatever. Look, it's nothing personal, we just think you need to move on.
Aide 2
Bu- AND you're a mean-spirited bitch who spits on people who aren't rich and famous.
A limousine, from the back seat. A small TV is on near the floor, behind the driver.
Reporter
And sources say that the new film will star Ben Affleck.
Ben
[sitting at the other end of the passenger cabin] Huhuhuh, that's me. [a door opens opposite him and J-Lo enters] How'd it go, baby?
Jennifer Lopez
Terrible, Ben! Some girl in Colorado is trying to become the new Jennifer Lopez! [her dog begins to bark] Shut up! [a few more barks and she tosses it out the window.]
Ben
What?? Who could replace you??
Jennifer Lopez
[tries to get the driver's attention] Yo driver. Stupid driver!
Driver
[looks back] Yes, ma'am. Where to?
Jennifer Lopez
Take me to South Park, Colorado! I'm gonna kill that bitch!!
South Park Elementary, day. The kids file in to class. Many of them are already seated. Butters is looking out the window.
Cartman

Kyle
[decide to answer] ...What?
Cartman
[approaches him] Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!
Stan
What are you gloating about?
Cartman
Oh, I'm not gloating. I just got a little call from a record company in Los Angeles and, they want Ms. Lopez to record an album next week.
Kids in Class
Wow, really?
Kyle
No!
Cartman
[a slight gloat arises] Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich. [nods to his hand] And famous.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
Butters
[pipes up and turns to the class] Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!
Mr. Garrison
Butters, will you pay attention, please?
Butters
Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!
Cartman
Jennifer Lopez?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Yes?
Butters
Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!
A boy
Wow, cool! [the kids leave their seats and head for the window]
Mr. Garrison
Will you kids shut up? [puts his book away and walks to the window] Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are not-! Oh my God, that's Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. [the limo has pulled up. Jennifer and Ben climb out of the limo and the driver directs them to the office.]
Mr. Slave
Oh Jesus, will you look at those boots?
Mr. Garrison
Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! [rushes out and the cheering class and Mr. Slave follow]
South Park Elementary, outside, later. Word gets around and all of the school comes out to see for itself.
Principal Victoria
Is it true? Jennifer Lopez is here?
Mr. Mackey
Here she comes! Here she comes!
Jennifer Lopez
Okay! What smart-mouthed little punk-ass bitch has been saying they're the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!
Principal Victoria
[Mr. Adler takes a picture] J-Lo, can we get a picture of you with the kids?
Jennifer Lopez
[begins pacing] No! Shut up! If I find the ho who thinks she's taken my career from me, I'm gonna wring her pretty little neck! [reaches the other end of the crowd] So, nobody want's to fess up, huh? Too scared to talk?! You'd better remember, bitch, that I'll come and take you down if you ever say anythin' again! [walks away]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[a few seconds later...] You can suck my culo, chica! [Cartman looks up, stunned, as Jennifer Lopez returns to the crowd]
Jennifer Lopez
[looks around] Who was that?! [all the kids back away from Cartman while pointing at him] You go' a problem?!
Cartman
Not me!
Jennifer Lopez
Then who? [Cartman brings out his hand and points to it with the other]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Hola, bitchola! [Cartman is looking ever more fearful]
Jennifer Lopez
What the hell is that?!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
My name is Hennifer Hlopez! And I like tacos, and burritos.
Jennifer Lopez
That? That's what replaced me?!
Cartman
I'm sure it was just a mistake.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Only mistake was when this ghetto trash got signed in the first place!
Cartman
Shut your God-damned mouth!
Jennifer Lopez
[picks Cartman up by the scruff of his jacket] You fucking smartass, who do you think you are?!
Cartman
Nobody!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
I am Yennifer Hrlopez! I eat tacos, and burritos!
Jennifer Lopez
Fuck you! [begins to assault Cartman's hand]
Cartman
Yaaaaah! Wait! I'm sorry! Ah I'll stop! I'll stop!
Jennifer Lopez
You'd better stop!
Cartman
I will!
Ben
[walks up to join Jennifer] Come on, Jenny, let's go.
Bebe
Wow, Ben Affleck.
Ben
We should be getting back to the... [something grabs his attention. Cartman looks away. Ben begins to fall for this new Jennifer Lopez]
Jennifer Lopez
Don' you forget what'll happen to you, ho! Come on, Benny!
She drags him off, but he glances back at the new Jennifer Lopez. He follows the original Lopez into the limousine, looking back one more time. As the limo leaves, Ben looks back one more time with his hands up against the glass as if blowing a kiss. The crowd then disperses.
Kyle
Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
Cartman
Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
Kyle
Good.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[rises once more] Or maybe I shou-ould.
Kyle
Aw, God-dammit!
Cartman
Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Ohsisisi, senor.
Kyle
That does it. I'm out. [walks off]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh, where are you going, Kyle? Come give me kisses!
Music Lab Recording Studios, night.
Aide 1
All right, Ms. Lopez, take it from the top. [music begins. Cartman is on a stool with his puppet at his side.]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Baby let's make a run for the border,
I've got a hunger only tacos can stop.
I know exactly what I'll order
Three tacos two tostadas and a soda pop.

BHI President
Gentlemen, we have ourselves a hit.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
I need to make a run for the border,
If you pay I'll take off my top.
Do you remember what I want to order?
Three tacos two tostadas and a soda pop.
Yeah-eah, and don't forget the hot sauce, Cholo!

Cartman's house, night. He's asleep, dreaming.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Cartman
Moooommm! [Cartman's mother enters the room]
Liane
What's the matter, sweetie?
Cartman
Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
Cartman's house, day. Ben Affleck approaches the front door with a bouquet of flowers and knocks on the door.
Cartman
[real tired] He-yesss.
Ben
Hey, I was wondering if I could talk to Ms. Lopez.
Cartman
[hides his left hand] She's not here right now.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[muffled] Ben? Is that my darling Ben?
Ben
Jenny? Yes, Jenny, eheh, it's me! Where are you? Please, I-I have to see her! [Cartman sighs deeply, then shows his hand to Ben]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Ben!!! Oh, you brought me roses!
Ben
Jenny, ah Jenny I just can't stop thinking about you. [lowers the bouquet to Cartman, who takes it away angrily]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
I can't stop thinking about you either, Ben!
Ben
I've been meaning to write a song or a poem, but I have no talent.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
I know, my darleeeng. That's okay.
Ben
Will you just take a ride with me in my awesome car?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh Ben, I would LOVE to!
Cartman
NO!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
'Scuse me one second, Ben. [whips towards Cartman] Don't you ruin this opportunity for me! How can you stand in the way of this?!
Cartman
I'm not going out in his car.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
I'm not gonna let you blow this one chance I have.
Cartman
I don't care. I'm supposed to sit here and do my homework. [Ben stars picking his nose]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Don't you dare [becomes unintelligible]
Cartman
I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Okay, Ben, let's go!
A mountain road. Ben and Cartman drive along at a fast clip.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh Ben, I am soo happy! The cool breeze blowing through my hair in your sexy automobile.
Ben
Let's spend the whole day together!
A soft song plays. The next scene is a dawn on a beach, where "Jennifer Lopez" and Ben run side by side. Cartman looks tired. Next is a restaurant where Ben has some wine while "Jennifer Lopez" enjoys a martini. Next scene, they're watching a movie together. "Jennifer Lopez" has her own seat between Ben and Cartman. Bem stretches and puts his hand on the headrest behind "Jennifer Lopez". Cartman looks, then looks away angrily. Next scene is at a jewelry store, where Ben picks out some earrings for "Jennifer Lopez". "Jennifer Lopez" opens her mouth in delight and Ben smiles. Next scene, Ben is resting on Cartman's lap and chatting with "Jennifer Lopez". Again, Cartman looks away in disgust. Last scene is undercover photos taken of Ben and "Jennifer Lopez", which end up on The National Inquisition.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh Ben, you are so perfect, so spectacularrr in every way
You bring light into my life, Ben. You almost make me forget all about...
Tacos! Oh, tacos, so good in my tummy yummy yummy give me more.
I love you, Ben. You almost make me forget about...
Tacos......

Ben
Jenny, I have to tell you something. I... I think I love you.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Hoohh, I love you too, Ben! [Cartman looks away in disgust] But...
Ben
But what?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
But what if you still have feelings for the slut with the large ass?
Ben
[pulls off to the side, with South Park in view.] I still care for her. Maybe I always will. But... You just have so much more going on. Up here. [strokes the top of Cartman's hand]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh Ben. Beennn.
Ben
Jenny, can I kiss you?
Cartman
[reacts] NO!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Yes! Oh yes, Ben, kiss me! [Cartman looks in wonder as his hand gets a mind of its own]
Cartman
Aw, God dammit! [looks away in disgust once more. Ben begins to give French kisses to "Jennifer Lopez" and the hand responds] Aww- awww, dude!
Ben
Mmm, just like tacos.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Taco-flavored kisses for my Ben.
Ben
You're so hot, baby.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
I make you hot, Ben?
Ben
Mm, yeah. [grabs the hand and kisses it for a while, then lets go. The hand drops down into Ben's pants] Oh, Jenny. [the zipper goes down on his pants] Oh Jenny! ["Jennifer Lopez" bobs up and down]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[pops up to say] Ben... [drops down again]
Ben
Oh God, Jenny!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh, Ben, I adore you! [Cartman looks at Ben's actions, then at what his hand is doing...]
Cartman
OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT! [opens his door, hops out, and walks away] WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!
Ben
But I love her!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Ben!
Ben
Jenny! Jenny, I'll call you!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
I love you, Ben!
Music Lab Recording Studio, night. "Jennifer Lopez" is recording new tracks. Cartman is practically sleeping on the job as his hand belts out new tunes.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Ooo baby baby, can I have your tacos?
Two tacos chulo, too. I'm just Jenny from the hood.
Ooo, can I have your tacos? Oh- stop. Stop, stop. STOP!

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez

Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Fine my ass, cholo! [Cartman wakes up and looks at his hand] I'll tell you when it's fine!
Music Lab Recording Studio, night, back entrance. Cartamn exits and goes down three steps.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Stupid idiots! How am I supposed to make an album with those cholos?! [a bat hits a car nearby]
Jennifer Lopez
[stands next to the car she just bashed] You little snot-nose! [Cartman is taken aback] You ruin my career and now you're trying to steal my man?! [holds up the tabloid shown earlier]
Cartman
Aww crap.
Jennifer Lopez
You'd better stay away from him! [begins whacking away at Cartman's hand]
Cartman
OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
Hell's Pass Hospital, next day. Dr. Doctor is showing Liane, Cartman's mother, an X-ray of her son's hand.
Dr. Doctor
Your son's hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers.
Liane
Oh dear.
Dr. Doctor
But I'm more concerned about his state of mind. Your son appears to be completely insane.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[on its own hospital bed, with wires attached] Ahhh Ahhhh [Cartman sits in a chair displeased]
Cartman
I told you this would happen. [Kyle, Stan and Kenny show up.]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh, hello guys.
Kyle
Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh, Kyle, why you no like meee?
Cartman
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
Kyle
I hate you. [turns right and walks out]
Liane
Come on, sweetie. Doctor says you need to get home and get lots of rest.
Cartman's house, morning. A cock crows. Cartman, asleep, stretches and wakes up, then glances to his left.
Cartman
EHAGH! [next to him is Ben Affleck, naked and relaxed] Moooooommmm! [Ben wakes up]
Liane
[enters with a cup of coffee and wearing a pink robe] What is it, sweetie?
Cartman
Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
Liane
Oooo, looks like the tooth fairy was extra-happy with you.[backs out of the room and closes the door.]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Buenos dias, my love.
Ben
Good morning, baby.
Cartman
You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
He's not going anywhere! Ben and I were up all night making love.
Cartman
What? Oh- AWWW! [wipes his hand off on his pajamas] Ben Affleck's spooge!!
Ben
Should we tell him the news?
Cartman
What news?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
I think we should tell him.
Ben
It's S'aright?
Cartman
S'aright.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
S'aright.
Ben
We're getting married!!
Cartman
Oh, balls!
Kyle's house, day. He, Stan and Kenny watch TV on the couch. The doorbell rings.
Kyle
Come in. [the bell rings again.] COME IN!! [Cartman enters wearing an oven mitt over his left hand.]
Cartman
[sad] Guys, I need to talk to you.
Stan
What's the matter?
Cartman
I can't handle it anymore. All the fame and the Ben Affleck spooge, I... I just can't go on living with Ms. Lopez.
Kyle
So stop doing it!
Cartman
Stop doing what?
Kyle
You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
Cartman
Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? [removes the oven mitt and "Jennifer Lopez" emerges coughing]
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Don't you dare ever do that to me again!
Kyle
Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand doesn't need to breathe!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
You try being in an oven mitt for two hours!
Kyle
I can see your lips moving!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
I can see your lips moving too, culo!
Kyle
See?! I just saw your lips move!
Cartman
Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
Stan
What's she doing?
Kyle
Come here! [drags Stan off to the dining room] You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
Stan
I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
Kyle
Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, [Kyle does a pretty solid impression of Cartman] "Haha, I got you guys to believe me!" "You guys are stupid!"
Stan
Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
Kyle
YES, dude! [they then walk back into the living room]
Stan
Cartman, we decided that if you can be mature and admit to everyone that you've gotten yourself into this mess, then we'll help you.
Cartman
Okay, okay, I know that I control everything Ms. Lopez does.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Oh no you don't!
Cartman
Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
Kyle
Out! [walks off. Stan and Kenny follow him out]
Cartman
Guys... Uh... Uh... [dejected, he turns away and walks out the front door]
Outside, day. Cartman reaches the sidewalk when he sees something.
Ben
There you are, Jenny! I've been lookin' all over for you, baby! [Cartman decides to run in the other direction] Jenny? [Cartman sees a car pull up in front of him and then...]
Aide 1
Ms. Lopez, you were due in the studio two hours ago! Come on! [Cartman decides to ran back towards Ben, but runs into a pair of female legs]
Jennifer Lopez
[disheveled, wielding a running chainsaw over her head] So you're gettin' married, huh? [revs up the motor, and Cartman makes his escape, screaming. In the background, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny have stepped out the door to see what's going on.]
Ben
Don't you hurt her!
BHI President
We'll sue you!
Kyle
Oh Jesus.
A bridge over a wide river, day. Jennifer Lopez has followed Cartman here. Cartman screams. A police car pulls up from the other end of the bridge. The driver steps out, and both officers draw their guns at Jennifer Lopez, now unrecognizable.
Police Officer 1
Freeze, leafblower! [she drops the chainsaw and holds her hands up]
Aide 1
Arrest that woman! She wants to kill one of our artists! [the arrest is made]
Police Officer 2
All right, you're going downtown, bean-breath.
Ben
[rushes up to "Jennifer Lopez"] Jenny! Oh, I thought I was going to lose you! Let's run away and get married tonight!
Aide 2
Hey, she can't get married tonight, she has a recording session! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive]
Ben
Our love is like rain!
Jennifer Lopez
That's what you said about me, asshole!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Quiet!
BHI President
Get her out of here!
Jennifer Lopez
Fuck you!
Police Officer 2
Shut up, picante pants!
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
Everyone be quiet! [Everyone stops what they're doing and look at the hand] I'm... I'm not who you think I am.
BHI President
You're not?
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
No. It was all a lie. A lie I cannot continue anymore. I am not Hennifer Lopez. I am... [Cartman rips off the small wig he had on his hand and delivers a new voice] ...Mitch Connor. [everyone, including Kyle, gasps]
Police Officer 2
Who's Mitch Connor?
Mitch Connor
Just your run of the mill con man. I've been moving from town to town, scamming people since I was fifteen. But I'm tired of runnin'.
Kyle
[exasperated] Oh no, no, no.
Mitch Connor
I've been a cheat all my life. And now I've ruined a singer's career, lost a record company millions, and cost this little boy his precious time.
Kyle
Stop. It.
Mitch Connor
Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben. I'm sorry I played Tiddly Winks with your heart. [Ben begins to sob. Cartman walks to one side of the bridge] But it's over now. The cyanide pill I took should be taking effect very soon. Hmph, looks like the sun is goin' down. I wonder, will I dream? [as the sun drops below the horizon, Cartman opens his hand and a gust of wind is heard. Whatever was possessing the hand parted. Ben sobs once more as Cartman just stares in wonder]
Police Officer 2
Well, looks like Mitch Connor has cashed in his last chips. [everyone disperses except the boys. Ben stays on for a second, but he too leaves.]
Kyle
[the boys step forward] Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?
Cartman
I don't know, Kyle, all right? Look, I don't care what you guys believe. But with all the crazy stuff that goes on in this town, isn't it possible, just possible, that something I don't understand happened here?
Kyle
[resigns] All right. [Cartman beams] All right, I guess it's possible.
Cartman
[dances back to the other three boys] Hahahahahaaaha! [into Kyle's face] I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
A fast-food Mexican Restaurant, La Taco. People are enjoying their food, one person is waiting for his order, and there are employees behind the counter. One of them looks familiar.
Manager
Okay, Ms. Lopez, over here we have the toppings station. This is where all your cheeses and lettuce will go on. [a man carrying a large bowl walks up behind Lopez and bumps into her]
Jennifer Lopez
[jumping to one side] Ow. Look out, muffinhead!
Manager
Ahh, look, Ms. Lopez, uh, if you're gonna be a member of the La Taco family, you're gonna have to learn to get along with people.
Jennifer Lopez
Get a what with who?
Manager
Uh why don't you start chopping those onions and I'll come check on you a little later?
Jennifer Lopez
[begins chopping the onions] This is bullshit! How the fuck did I end up working at a La Taco?! I had six platinum records and I starred in five Hollywood movies!
Coworker
Yeah. Meee too.
Cartman as Jennifer Lopez
[as credits roll]
Oh Ben, you are so perfect, so spectacularrr in every way
You bring light into my life, Ben. You almost make me forget all about...
Tacos! Oh, tacos, so good in my tummy yummy yummy give me more.
I love you, Ben. You almost make me forget about...
Tacos...

Lil' Crime Stoppers
South Park neighborhood, day. The boys walk up to Butters' house. Stan knocks on the door. The door opens and Butters' father looks out.
Chris
Yes? [looks down] Oh, hello, boys.
Cartman
Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
Chris
Oooo, little crime stoppers, huh? Well, I'm afraid I don't have any crimes I need solved right now.
Kyle
Awww, shit!
Stan
All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. [offers up a business card]
Chris
I'll do that. Have fun, boys. [steps back and closes the door. The boys turn and walk away]
Cartman
Stupid assholes! [turns and follows] How come nobody has a crime to solve?
Kyle
Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a great idea.
Stan
It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. [moments later they reach a pink house and Stan knocks again. The door opens and an elderly woman looks out]
Mrs. Farnickle
Oh, hello there boys.
Stan
Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need solved, for a dollar?
Mrs. Farnickle
Ohh, neighborhood detectives, huh? Well let me thi-oh yes! There is something!
Kyle
Really?
Mrs. Farnickle
Yes. Two days ago I put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool. [Stan and Kyle look over at the window] And later, when I went to get it, it was gone.
Cartman
My God...
Stan
Have you reported this to any other authorities?
Mrs. Farnickle
Noo, but I think it's a perfect case for you kids.
Kyle
Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
Stan
We're on the case.
Mrs. Farnickle's house, backyard.
Cartman
What have you got, Marsh?
Stan
Detective McCormick found something interesting. [a shot of Kenny, who just raises his arm and point to his right. The camera pans to Duke, the house pet, licking off the last of the pie]
Cartman
[puts a hand on Kyle, looks away and closes his eyes] Jesus, we're too late.
Kyle
I think we can piece this case together now.
Mrs. Farnickle's house, living room. She and her husband sit back in arm chairs looking at news. The door opens and the boys rush in with the pie tin.
Mrs. Farnickle
My pie tin! Oooh, but what happened to the pie?
Kyle
Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
Mr. Farnickle
Well, what do you think happened, little detectives?
Stan
You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time. [the scenario shows Mrs. Farnickle setting the pie on the sill, closing the windows and walking away] But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. [Mr. Farnickle shows up at the kitchen window, looking at the pie from inside the kitchen]
Kyle
Your husband. [he looks closer at it, putting his hands on the window] He wanted that pie badly, but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet.
Cartman
Slowly the rage built inside his mind. [Mr. Farnickle is shown in bed, getting angry. Dramatic lighting enhances the mood] "Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
Stan
His plan was to use a hammer.
Cartman
Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. [the scenario shows Mr. Farnickle walking up behind his wife as she dusts the TV and whacking her three times, killing her and fracturing her skull]
Stan
Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. [the man plunges the shovel through the woman's neck and cleaves the head from the body. Blood pours out and stains the carpet]
Kyle
Then saw off the arms and legs. [shown in all its graphic glory]
Cartman
The torso he would dump into the lake. [Mr. Farnickle tosses his wife's torso over the side of his boat, then watches as the torso heads for the lake bottom]
Stan
The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. [the man is shown tossing the second leg into the tub, then stirring the solution so that the leg would sink in and disappear]
Cartman
And then, finally, he'd be able to eat that pie.
Kyle
But before he could go through with his entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten... [a new scenario: the man now has the hammer, but the pie is gone when he checks up on it] ...by your dog. [a shot of Duke eating the pie in his doghouse]
Cartman
Looks like the game is over, old man! [the surprised couple looks at them]
Mrs. Farnickle
Oh my God, what kind of television have you kids been watching??
Stan
Just the news.
Mrs. Farnickle
All right, all right, you you boys run along now.
Stan
[stays behind] Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.
Mrs. Farnickle
Fine, here, just go! [gives him the dollar, and he joins the others outside]
Stan
Wow, look, you guys! Our first dollar! [shows off a crisp new one-dollar bill]
Kyle
We're in business!
A basement, some time later. The dollar bill is newly framed and hung on a wall in ... Cartman's basement, which is now the South Park Detectives headquarters. Pictures of suspects are on the wall below the framed dollar, a chalkboard has some instructions listed, and some suspects already interviewed are listed on the wall beneath the stairs. Kyle puts a file away in a filing cabinet as the other boys do other tasks.
Cartman
Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington.
Liane
Boys, you have a little visitor. [a little girl descends the stairs past Liane]
Girl
Is this the South Park Crime Unit?
The Boys
Ah! Oh. [they jump up and leave their tasks to meet their first client]
Stan
Yes it is!
Girl
I lost my dolly.
Cartman
[waving his mom off] Thank you, Ms. Secretary, that will be all. [Liane goes upstairs. Cartman looks up] And get us some more cookies and coffee! We're not paying you to sit on your ass!
Kyle
Do you know where your doll is?
Girl
If I knew where it was, it wouldn't be lost.
Stan
All right, Sarah, come over here. [everyone moves over to Kenny's desk. Sarah hops up on the witness chair] Now, I want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist, Kenny.
Sarah
[Kenny begins to draw as she talks] She has curly blonde hair. And a wed dress. And a turned-up nose. And a blue bow in her hair.
Stan
You got it, Ken? [Kenny finishes and nods]
Kyle
All right, let's see. [Kenny turns the paper around and shows off a crudely-drawn woman with huge, olive-shaped boobs] Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
Stan
Put that away, dude! [Kenny walks up to a small bulletin board of KeNnY'S mOST WANtED women, all of which have large boobs]
Cartman
Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
Sarah's house, day. The boys swarm into the girl's bedroom and check out all the possibilities.
Cartman
No sign of forced entry.
Kyle
[at the window] But the window isn't locked.
Stan
[turns to address Cartman] Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree. [the scenario begins. A view into the bedroom from the tree at night] He would have watched Sarah with her doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife. [a hand appears, then the opposite hand with a knife. The knife cuts the first hand as Sarah drops her doll on the bedroom floor] The pain gave him sick pleasure.
Kyle
Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
Cartman
We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room.
As they pause, another group of boys swarm in and start their own investigation.
A Boy
All right, let's do this by the books! McDonnell, [one boy steps forward] give me smears of all the places the doll used to be! [goes off to get samples] Mitchell, [another boy steps forward] run a tap on the phone! [goes off to tap the phone]
Stan
[approaches the boy] Hey, kid, what are you doing?
The Boy
Agent Tucker, FBI! And you?
Stan
Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
Tucker
...Not anymore, you're not!
Cartman
Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
Tucker
Can't we? You guys are playing Detectives. We're playing FBI. That gives us jurisdiction over you!
Stan
Aw crap!
Tucker
I want choppers on the roof ready to go! [one of his friends goes to the window, the other two head out of the room]
Kyle
Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
Tucker
Good. Then you can help us by telling me everything you know.
Sarah's house, afternoon, outside. The boys have been kicked out by the FBI boys and head for the sidewalk.
Stan
Son of a bitch stupid FBI!
Cartman
Well, I guess we can go back to playing laundromat.
Stan
No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that little girl's doll before those FBI guys do.
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Kyle
Yeah, but how?
Stan
We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
Cartman
Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
Cartman's basement, later. The boys have called Butters in and he's confused, being under the spotlight.
Cartman
[thinks hard of how to start the interrogation] Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
Butters
Ah, I was at home.
Cartman
Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! [behind him, Stan and Kyle watch from a makeshift booth]
Kenny
[patting Butters' shoulder] (Awww, don't be so mean. Butters is our friend, huh?) [Butters smiles]
Stan
[behind the booth] They've gotten really good at this good-cop bad-cop thing.
Cartman
You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
Kenny
(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)
Cartman
You're a worthless two-dollar criminal and you're lying!
Kenny
(Aww, it's okay, little fella.)
Butters
Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
Cartman
Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. [holds out a cup for Butters to take]
Butters
How do I do that?
Cartman
You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
Butters
Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
Cartman
Stop playing games!
Butters
I'm not playing. I really don't know!
Cartman
That does it! Wait right here! [goes behind the booth and laughs] Guys, did you hear that? Butters doesn't know how you make semen come out of your body.
Kyle
How... do you make semen come out?
Cartman
I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
Stan
It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
Cartman
Really?
Kyle
Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
Cartman
Oh okay. [returns to the table] Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
Butters
No!
Cartman
Follow me to the bathroom. [goes upstairs]
Kenny
[soothing] (Aw, it's okay, kid. It's not going to hurt.) [Butters hops off the chair and follows Cartman upstairs]
The Cartman hallway. Cartman takes Butters to the restroom.
Cartman
Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
Butters
My wiener??
Cartman
Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it! [Butters grabs the door handle and shuts the door. Cartman waits for a few second before doing anything] Well, Butters?!
Butters
Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
Cartman
Well pull harder!
Butters
...ow... Ow... It's not workin'.
Cartman
Try doin' it faster.
Butters
[increasing the speed] Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'.
Cartman
Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
Butters
NOOooo!
Cartman
The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
Butters
Okay!!
Stan
[rushing up with Kyle and Kenny] Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
Cartman
Let's go! [They leave. Butters remains in the bathroom]
Butters
...ow... Ow!
Fosse's house, a nice rambling house. Cartman approaches the front door as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny stand off to one side. He turns and places his back against the wall, then sneaks up to a window. He looks in just a bit. Inside, Fosse plays with a doll... red dress, turned-up nose, blonde curly hair with two blue bows attached... just as Sarah had described. The two boys giggle as they play.
Fosse
Huhuh, Okay Ms., Ms. Jones, heh, me and Doctor... Flick here just need to... check your vagina. [pulls up the front of the doll's dress and giggles with Bill]
Bill
That's gay. [giggles with Fosse]
Fosse
Yeah, that's gay. [Cartman looks in intently. He then turns his back against the wall and backs away with his water pistol drawn]
Cartman
[in hushed tones] Kyle!
Kyle looks on as Cartman starts signing to him. Cartman holds up his index finger and shows the fleshy side to Kyle, then points two fingers to his own eyeballs, then turns the fingers out and shows them, then motions inside with his thumb, then makes a grabbing gesture, then something like a fist, then a thumbs-up, then a fist turned out, then points to Kyle, then points again, then taps the side of his own head, then makes a J sign on his head, then rests.
Kyle
What? [Cartman repeats the gestures again] What??
Cartman
[repeats the gestures] I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
Kyle
[gasps, then with determination, in hushed tones] They've got the doll! [he, Stan, and Kenny move in and the four boys take positions around the door. Kyle stands at the door, Cartman and Kenny on either side, Stan at Kyle's back]
Stan
[in hushed tones] Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! [Kenny turns and rings the bell. Inside, Bill and Fosse stop their play and go to the door]
Fosse
Huh huh who is it?!
Stan
South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
Fosse
[giggles] They're playing Detective. [they giggle]
Bill
That's gay. [they giggle]
Fosse
[calls out] You're gay! [outside, the boys lower their guns.]
Kyle
What do we do now?
Stan
I don't know.
Cartman
Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. [hops down from the porch and walks away]
Stan
Dude, we just can't tell on them.
Cartman
Why not?
Kyle
Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
Fosse
[from inside] Detectives! [Cartman returns, and the camera angle switches to the living room. Bill and Fosse have made the doll a hostage, having tied her up on a chair. Fosse continues, giggling] If you don't get out of here, we're gonna rip the doll's head off!
Bill
Yeah.
Fosse
We were playing gynecologists and now we're playing criminals.
Bill
That's gay.
Fosse
We're gay.
Stan
Jesus! They're gonna kill her!
Kyle
We've got to do something.
Cartman
Time! Time is what we need, but time is something we ain't got!
Tucker
[offscreen] Attention! You in the house! [the other kids are shown, with their own little car] This is Agent Tucker with the FBI! We have you surrounded. Sort of.
Stan
[he and the others approach the FBI kids] Hey, you butt-holes can't play FBI here!
Cartman
Yeah! This was our hot lead!
Tucker
And you did a great job leading us here. Now you just stay out of our way! [into the megaphone] The gig is up, Fosse! Bring out the doll! Or we'll tell on you!
Stan
We're gonna charge the front door and go get it.
Tucker
No you're not.
Cartman
Dammit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
Tucker
Climb off, kid! We say you can't charge the front door, and you have to obey what the FBI says! That's the rules!
Stan
Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
Tucker
Yes it does so! [a long pause]
Kyle
...Grrrr!!! [the boys turn and walk away]
Kenny
(What do we do now?)
Stan
We go get the doll ourselves.
Kyle
But they said we can't charge the front door.
Stan
That's right. [cocks his left hand] But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
Tucker
Come on guys. You don't wanna hurt that doll.
Bill
Huhuh. [notices the SP boys coming in] Oh crap, they're coming in the back! [the shootout begins. The boys fan out and make firing noises as they aim at Bill and Fosse. Bill and Fosse return fire with their own noises] That's gay. [he and Fosse hide behind an armchair]
Stan
[pops up from the couch and fires away, using the back of the couch as a shield] Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!
Fosse
No you didn't!
Stan
Did so!
Fosse
No, 'cause I got... special wizard armor on.
Kyle
We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, ass-face!
Cartman
All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo! [moves out from behind the couch, shooting slowly but walking normally] Wwwaaahhh!
Fosse
[makes sweeping gestures with his hands] Oooh, they got me! [falls a bit further with each] Whooaaa, whooaaa, whooaaa. [now fully stretched on the floor, closes his eyes as if dead]
Bill
[follows suit] rr uh rr uh, uhhhh. [makes like he's dead]
Fosse
[opens his eyes and giggles] We're dead.
Bill
[opens his eyes and giggles] That's gay.
Stan
[getting the doll after he, Kyle and Kenny approach the chair] We got it.
Sarah's house, later. Stan and the boys walk up to the house again. Stan knocks on the door, and Sarah's mother answers.
Stan
Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?
Sarah
[appears at the doorway and lights up as she runs for her doll] My dolly! [gets it and holds it tight]
Cartman
We got her back safe. Lost a lot of good men in the process.
Sarah's Mom
Well you boys are little heroes. I'm going to call the police department and let them know what brave little detectives you are! [the boys smile proudly]
Park County Police Station, day. This building is much bigger than the building Barbrady upholds the law from in South Park.
Dawson
Hello there little crime stoppers, I'm Lieutenant Dawson with the Park County Police. I heard you did a great job finding Sarah Peterson's doll.
Stan
We do what we can, sir.
Dawson
Well, that's fantastic, kids. And for all your terrific sleuth-solving, I'm hereby making you all Junior Detectives. [hands out badges]
Kyle
[Kyle opens his] Wow! [the others have similar reactions]
Dawson
That means you boys are now an official part of the department.
Cartman
Kewl!
Dawson
All right, so ready for your first assignment?
Stan
Sure.
Dawson
Okay. There's a meth lab down at 567 Mala Vista. The operators are probably armed to the hilt with illegal weapons. I want you to get down there and see what you can find!
Kyle
Ah... a a a meth lab?
Dawson
[sits at his desk] I don't want any problems. Just take 'em down by the books. Now get over there; the mayor's all over my ass on this one! [the boys turn to leave] On, and deputies: you screw this up and I'll have you working graveyard shift behind a desk! Move it! [the boys run off]
Nighttime in the boondocks. The boys walk along a barren stretch of road.
Kyle
What is a meth lab, anyway?
Stan
I don't know. Let's just hurry up. I wanna get home in time to watch Crime Drama. [they turn and walk towards a large building in the distance]
The meth lab. Three men sit around a table as a forth man works behind them. The junior detectives approach the front door. Stan knocks. The men inside quickly arm themselves.
Stan
Uh police. Open up. ...Oh crap, did you guys do your math homework?
Kyle
Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. [windows begin breaking as shots are fired at the boys]
Man 1
You die, pigs!
Gunfire continues breaking windows] You want to die, huh? [loses control of the gun, which causes a bullet to ricochet and hit some flammable liquids. A fire erupts and begins to spread, torching one of the man's friends. The burning friend breaks through the front door and runs out. The two other friends hop into a truck and break through the garage door. The passenger pulls out his gun.
Man 3
You won't take us alive!
Their truck hits a ramp and goes into the air, twisting to the left and ending up in the middle of a road. Another truck arrives and its driver honks his horn. The oncoming truck strikes the disabled truck and pushes it along. At a nearby intersection, a car strikes the disabled truck and that truck blows up. Three burning people get out of the truck and run around. A fifth man in the meth lab flies a plane.
Man 5
So long, coppers!
His fuel level hits empty] Oh, shit! [His plane goes straight down and hits the post office and another building. More burning people run around, and the boys can barely believe what they're seeing.
Stan
Damn.
Park County Police Dept., Dawson's office, later that night. He reads the police report and paces behind his desk.
Dawson
One UPS vehicle valued at twenty-five thousand dollars, one civilian vehicle worth sixteen thousand, the second floor of the post office AND a coffee shop valued at sixty thousand! The mayor's gonna have my ass!
Stan
Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
Dawson
You got careless! Now, I don't know how they do things down at that dog-and-pony show they call the Fourth Grade, but here we have rules! Jesus, we don't even have guys to question now, because you killed them all!
Kyle
We're sorry.
Dawson
One more slip-up like that and I'll have your badges! You hear me?! Now hit the showers!
Park County Police Dept., locker room. Three men are changing clothes, so they're all in their briefs. The boys enter.
Officer 1
Well well well, if it isn't the super-cops. [the officers begin to giggle]
Officer 2
Hey Murphy, think they'll let me borrow their G.I. Joes?
Officer 4
Come on, you guys. Leave them alone.
Murphy
[Officer 1] Relax, Hopkins! [removes his briefs and drops them to the ground] All fun and games, right? [moves to the end of the lockers and hides behind it, only to peek out] Soho, tell us, rookies, you ah... find yourself a little bonus in that house??
Cartman
Uh bonus?
Murphy
Come on! We all skim a little off the top. Oh. Or are you too good for that? [walks back to the other officers] You think you're gonna waltz in here and clean up the system. Is that it?
Stan
[softly] We just wanna be junior detectives.
Murphy
LOOK, we all work hard! And we deserve more than the thirty-thousand a year we get paid! So what if we take in a little on the side?
Officer 2
Yeah! Who the hell are you to change that?!
Hopkins
I said, back off Murphy!
Murphy
Why don't you and your rookie friends make us
Officer 2
That's right. Come on, bring it!
Officer 3
Yeah, let's go! Come on, bring it!
Dawson
What the hell is the problem here??
Murphy
No problem, sir. No problem at all.
Dawson
Then hit the showers, all of you!
The shower room, moments later. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are taking their showers. Kyle drops his soap to fart, then picks it up again. Cartman works on his hair.
Kyle
Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
Cartman
Me neither.
Stan
It'll get better, guys.
Kyle
Better how, dude?
Stan
[puts his soap away] Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time into it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
Kyle
We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.
Stan
I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
Cartman
[intervening] Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
Stan
You guys can go back to playing Laundromat Owners if you want, but... I'm not gonna give those kids playing the FBI a chance to laugh at us. I'll see you guys at school tomorrow.
Cartman's house, night. His door opens, and a tired Cartman walks in.
Cartman
Awwwwrrr-auugh. [hangs up his coat and holster on the coat tree in the living room]
Liane
Eric, where have you been? It's ten thirty.
Cartman
We had to take down a meth lab on Mala Vista.
Liane
Well you should've called Mommy.
Cartman
[turns and snaps at her] Will you get off my back?! It's hard enough I gotta work the beat, and now I gotta come home to your nagging?! [realizes what he's doing, then turns away] Look look, I'm I'm sorry. It's just this case, and... the guys down at the station, I... I'm tired, alright? I'm I'm tired.
Liane
Well, why don't you get ready for snoogums' night-night, and I'll bring you some toasty chocolate nummers?
Cartman
[straightens up and smiles] Okay. [turns and walks off to bed. He passes by the bathroom. Butters is still in there]
Butters
Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!
Cartman
[stops] Butters?
Butters
Yes?
Cartman
Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
Butters
Well I'm tryin', but nothing's comin' out.
Cartman
Well, keep tryin', Butters.
Butters
Okay. [Cartman walks off] Ow. Ooww!
South Park Elementary, day. The boys are in class, sleeping. As Butters was at home at 9 am the previous day, this day is Monday.
Mr. Garrison
And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America. [turns around and quickly notices the sleeping boys] Uh, boys! [the boys stir and wake up] Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?
Kyle
Uh we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
Cartman
[thinks] A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
Mr. Garrison
Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?! [the boys look at each other, confused and afraid] That's what I thought! Now pay attention! [turns back to the board] Okay, children, now, the biggest skank of all was was an old fat-ass by the name of-
Dawson
[bursting through the classroom door] Marsh! Broflovski! McCormick! Cartman! In my office! [leaves]
The Boys
[hanging their heads] Eeagh!
Park County Police Department, later. The boys walk in sleepily. Dawson holds a file in his right hand.
Dawson
Looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg. They found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in Colorado.
Cartman
Uh oh...
Dawson
The operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in Inglewood. They're all cop killers, so I'm sending you in undercover. [the boys look at each other]
Kyle
Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
Dawson
What?! Now you listen to me! I'm givin' you one last chance! You're good cops, but you let your emotions get in the way! And your little "shoot first ask questions later" technique has no place in this century! Now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books, you got it?! The mayor is on my ass and blablablah! [the boys turn left and walk off. As they head for the entrance they walk down the hall. Around one corner are two of the officers they met in the locker room]
Murphy
So, what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant?
Stan
Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
Murphy
Maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our... bonus money.
Kyle
No. [the boys walk away]
Officer 2
They're lying.
Murphy
They're dead!
Inglewood, Colorado, night. A big city. The strip club shown is The Peppermint Hippo. Inside there are several dancers undulating for their patrons on individual stages. Other dancers dance on the club floor for individual patrons. The boys enter the club.
Kyle
Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
Kenny
[stops and looks around, then jumps for joy] (Woohoo!!) [rushes up to catch the other boys, who now sit around a small stage]
Stripper
[bloated woman with a coarse voice, opens an embrace to Stan] Would you like a dance?
Stan
No thanks.
Stripper
[moves to Kyle] Dance? [moves on] Anyone like a dance?
DJ
Well all right, guests, put your hands together. Be sure to tip the dancers. And now, come on, let's hear it for Candy!
Bouncer
[walks up to the boys] Whoa whoa, what the hell are you kids doin' in here? This isn't an appropriate place for children.
Stripper
[walking in the foreground, on the other side of the small stage] Dance? Anyone like a dance?
Kyle
Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.
Bouncer
[crosses his arms] Oh, really? Let's go see.
The Peppermint Hippo back room.
Owner
All right, so we'll have to start havin' the McCormicks make our meth again and-
Bouncer
Hey Gino, these kids say they know you.
Gino
What? Ha-I don't know no kids.
Bouncer
I didn't think so. All right, you kids-
Gino
Hey wait a minute. These kids might be just what we need to get our drugs past the security at DIA. How would you like to join our family?
Tall Goon
Yo Gino, I know I've seen these kids before, man. These kids are 5-0!
Gino
What?
Tall Goon
These kids are cops, man! [the five men in the room assume positions and start firing away at the boys. A man at the door is shot and he falls away. The boys begin pretending to fire back and make shooting noises.]
Cartman
Bang bang bang... [the boys move behind a chair. The men continue firing. The boys move back into view]
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
Bang bang bang... [the men move to lesser-powered weapons]
Kenny
(Pakew! Pakew!)
Cartman
[looks at Kenny] Kenny, it doesn't go "Pakew! Pakew!", it goes "BANG BANG BANG!!" [outside, police cars of all types pull up to the club. Dawson quickly jumps out of his car. An explosion appears in two windows of the club, and Dawson ducks a little]
Dawson
God damnit! Those junior detectives and their heroically reckless ways! Murphy! Jenkins! Hopkins! Get in there! [The three men move in. Jenkins is Officer 2. Inside, two of the owner's men rush out of the back room, and the strippers rush out of the way. The men turn around and shoot back at the boys. The boys return fire. None of the four boys has yet been hit. The gunfight continues. The old stripper walks by again]
Stripper
Dance??? Anybody like a dance??? [walks by without being hit once. The other two men appear and shoot at the boys]
Hopkins
[enters the club] Freeze! South Park detectives! [Murphy and Jacobs quickly enter and take aim. Everyone stops and turns around to face the detectives. The DJ stands in his booth] Great job, boys. You found the meth boss!
Gino
Detective Murphy! Jenkins! Uh what the hell are you doing? We had a deal.
Hopkins
[looks at his colleagues with suspicion] A deal?
Murphy
That's right. We're partners in the drug business. Everything was fine until these "super-cops" joined the force. [the boys look stunned at the revelation: these cops are crooked]
Jenkins
Now we've gotta kill you all.
Hopkins
Boys! Down! [the boys look for cover as the two crooked cops join the five men in firing at Hopkins. The boys huddle under a table]
DJ
Huh alright guys, put your hands together, a lot of shootin' and killin' goin' on, but be sure to tip your waitress let's hear it for Rebecca.
Dawson
Christ! Those junior detectives have no regard for the law! [FBI trucks pull up and agents pour out of them]
Lead FBI agent
Get me a hard line to the phone! And I want choppers on the roof!
Dawson
[walks up] Who the hell are you??
Lead FBI agent
[whips out his badge] Agent Fields, FBI!
Dawson
Hey, I'm in charge of this investigation.
Fields
Not anymore, you're not.
Dawson
But that's not fair!
Fields
Is so! Is so! [inside, the gunfight continues. Hopkins is shot, and he quickly kills two of Gino's men. Jenkins quickly shoots at Hopkins and gets the right arm. Hopkins winces and falls down]
Jenkins
Sorry, Detective Hopkins. We can't let anybody know about our partnership.
Gino
That's right. We split it all, fifty-fifty!
Murphy
That's right. [raises his gun and shoots Gino through the forehead. Gino's body slides down along the wall behind him] I think we'll take a hundred percent now.
Jenkins
Huhuh yeah. Sorry, Gino, but in business like this, sometimes partnerships need to end.
Murphy
That's right. [raises his gun and shoots Jenkins through the side of the head, and Jenkins wavers and falls] Sometimes partnerships need to end. [now seeing the boys] Well, super-cops, looks like I'll be taking in all the money now. I'm in business alone. And that means that the only person I can't trust... is myself. [raises the gun and shoots himself through his chin, then falls alongside Hopkins]
Outside the Peppermint Club. The paramedics have arrived and are removing the bodies. Hopkins, up and about, reaches the boys.
Hopkins
[his arm in a sling] It looks like Murphy and Jenkins got what they deserved. If it weren't for you boys, we would have never cleaned up the department.
Dawson
[approaches the boys] All right, detectives, let's get one thing straight! I do not agree with your methods! You're uncontrolled, and you're negligent! But by God you get the job done. Congratulations!
Stan
Thanks.
Dawson
I'm probably going to regret this, but, well, I'm promoting you to full detectives. There'll be lots of action, and that big paycheck you've always wanted. [the paramedics close up the ambulance, then climb in and leave. The boys mull over the offer]
Stan
...I think I have a better idea.
Cartman's basement, next day. The boys are back at playing Laundromat. The wall under the stairs has been removed to show the washer and dryer, which are now framed by a doorway saying "Employees Only." Two clothes racks are seen, and the detectives' desks are refashioned as washer/dryer combos. A "Laundromat" sign on the wall looks over the whole thing.
Kyle
Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.
Stan
[walks up with one of his outfits] Yes, I have a suit I need dry-cleaned, and pressed, please.
Kyle
Certainly.
Cartman
[walks up with some clothes] Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five. [Kenny hands him a card] On your American Express.
Butters
[coming down the stairs] Fellas! Hey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
Cartman
You did?
Butters
Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
Kyle
That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
Cartman
Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
End of Lil' Crime Stoppers

Red Man's Greed
Three Feathers Casino, night. People flock in. The building is massive, the front entrance is prefaced with a long pool with water jets shooting water into the air. The interior is shown, with its slot machines and milling crowds. The boys enter with the Marshes and the Broflovskis. Randy and Gerald carry cigars in their hands.
Stan
Wow, dude.
Cartman
Man, Indians have it good, huh?
Randy
Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.
Native American Chief
Welcome to the Three Feathers Casino. I'm your host, Chief Runs With Premise. Please try your luck at one of our many games.
Cartman
[eagerly] All right, let's go! [moves forward]
Runs With Premise
Halt. [spreads his arms out] I am afraid minors cannot go onto the casino floor.
Cartman
I'm not a miner, dumbass! Do you see a shovel in my hand?!
Runs With Premise
You kids can enjoy our Native American Comedy Club.
Gerald
All right, we're gonna hit the tables. Why don't you kids run along to the comedy club? [Stan shrugs and the boys leave. The adults move forward]
Randy
All right, time to win some money!
Gerald
Oh yeah! blackjack table!
Blackjack Dealer
Welcome to the blackjack table. May luck run through you, like the spirit of the buffalo.
Sheila
Gerald, this is ten dollars a hand!
Gerald
Relax, sweetie [in hushed tones] I know how to count cards.
Sheila
Well I don't wanna play here!
Sharon
Yeah. Come on, Sheila, let's go to the nickel slots.
Randy
Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. [smokes]
Gerald
All right, time to show these people how to gamble!
An entrance is shown - The Laughing Coyote Comedy Lodge, then the interior of the lodge itself. A Native American drummer sits on stage.
Announcer
Welcome to the Three Feathers Comedy Club. Please put your hands together for Johnny Manymoons! [Johnny approaches the mic]
Kyle
What is Native American comedy, anyway?
Manymoons
[takes the mic] Thank you, thank you. Bear walked into a bar. Bear said to Deer, "May I please... have a drink?" And so Deer said to Bear, "Why the big paws?" [the drums strikes three beats]
Audience
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! [the boys are confused]
Manymoons
Many moons ago, Pony and Eagle walked up to Coyote. Pony said to Coyote, "I am very mad at Eagle. Will you yell at him for me?" Coyote said to Pony, "Why can you not yell yourself?" And Pony replied, "Because I am a little horse." [the drums strikes three beats]
Audience
Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
The blackjack table. Gerald sits alone fiddling with some chips. Randy returns from somewhere with a cup of coins.
Randy
How's it goin', Gerald?
Gerald
[nervous, fidgeting] Ohh, not so good.
Randy
Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.
Gerald
Yeah. I'm down twenty-six thousand.
Randy
Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
Gerald
I forgot to tell you, ah I have a gambling problem.
Randy
Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!
Gerald
Sshhhh! I have to win it back before Sheila finds out!
Randy
Where did you get that kind of money??
Gerald
The casino gave me credit! I put the house up as collateral! But I still have this ten-dollar chip.
Blackjack Dealer
Dealer, twenty one. [takes the last chip] Sorry.
Gerald
[collapses on the table] That's it. I'm destitute. [leaps up and grabs Randy] Loan me money! You've gotta have money in the cup! [grabs the cup and tries to wrest it from Randy] Wha- what's in the cup?
Randy
[keeps the cup] Just six quarters!
Gerald
[sits down and mopes] Oh God. Oh Jesus.
Blackjack Dealer
Thank you for playing at Three Feathers. May your life be filled with the song of the sparrow.
Gerald
[bolts upright again] Oh, shove the song of the sparrow up your ass!
Three Bears Casino, sometime later. Randy and Gerald sit on a bench next to some slot machines. Gerald's head hangs low.
Gerald
How am I going to tell my family? [raises his head] How do I tell them that tomorrow, we have to ...pack up our things and ...get out of the house? [Sheila and Sharon show up in the background with the boys.]
Sheila
There's daddy!
Gerald
[hangs his head] Oh, Jesus. [the boys and the women arrive.]
Sheila
Where have you guys been? We've been looking all over.
Kyle
Yeah. Come on, Dad, this place sucks. I wanna go.
Gerald
[raises his head] What, What did you say?
Kyle
I said I wanna leave.
Gerald
[shifts gears and stands] Oh, you wanna leave, huh?! Okay, fine, Kyle, when we get home, we'll just pack up our things, load them in the car, and we'll leave! [Sheila and Kyle are baffled]
Kyle
What?? No, no, I mean, I-
Gerald
No, no, no, if you wanna leave South Park, fine! Tomorrow we're leaving!
Sheila
Gerald, what are you talking about?
Gerald
Oh, you heard him, Sheila! Kyle wants to leave! Our nice old house doesn't interest Kyle anymore! Well I'm calling a moving company right now! [leaves]
Cartman
Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. [Kyle remains baffled, even as he looks at Cartman]
Sharon
[walks up to Randy] What's wrong with Gerald?
Randy
He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
Sharon
What?? But don't the Native Americans know he has nowhere else to go?
Randy
They don't care. [the camera rises and focuses on a window behind them]
The casino office. Chief Runs with Premise looks out over the floor.
Runs with Premise
Look at them! Small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away!
Elder 1
Their cash flows out of them like diarrhea from the buffalo.
Elder 2
[wearing glasses] Yes, but we have milked these simple mountain folk almost dry. If we really want to see cash flow, we need to bring in city-people from Denver.
Runs with Premise
[turns around] Yeessss. It is time for us to implement our plan. [walks over to an easel on which sits a map of Colorado, with a new highway drawn on it between the casino and Denver] A superhighway, built from Denver right to our casino!
Aide 1
And what do we do about the small town of South Park that lies in the highway's way?
Runs with Premise
[holding up large stacks of bills] Simple. We buy it, and we demolish it! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
Elders
Ha ha ha ha!
South Park Elementary, next day. A town meeting is being held in the gym. Mayor McDaniels sits at a table with four aides, two on either side of her.
Mayor McDaniels
And that's really all I can tell you. The town of South Park is going to be leveled, in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway.
Randy
[rises] But how can they do that?!
Mayor McDaniels
The Native Americans have purchased the land out from under us. Tomorrow, they're buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership.
Jimbo
[rises] Well can't we stop them? Let's call the bank.
Mayor McDaniels
The Native Americans bought the bank.
Mr. Garrison
Oh my God.
Mayor McDaniels
Now, look, it isn't all horrible. The Native Americans are offering you retail values on your homes.
Randy
No, screw that! We'll just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves! [the town clamors in agreement]
Chef
[rises] Yeah! Let the South Park people own South Park! [the town clamors in agreement]
Randy
How much do we have to raise, Mayor?
Mayor McDaniels
Three hundred thousand dollars. [the town thinks, then grumbles]
Randy
Ohhh, never mind. [sits down]
The town library. Nine boys sit in front of it: Timmy, Jimmy, Tweek, Butters, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Alex.
Butters
How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
Cartman
Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
Kyle
[correcting] Native Americans. [Stan rises and walks away from the building]
Stan
Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. [begins to reminisce]
The scenes are as follows:
Zombies destroy the town as the boys walk through in their Halloween costumes.
Trapper Keeper grabs a phone booth as it reaches mammoth dimensions.
The townsfolk fight the mutant turkeys.
Christopher Reeve throws a truck at some people, and they dive out of the way.
The giant fireworks snake demolishes the town.
The Geldon causes havoc on the Drew Carey Show as the Knights of Standards and Practices watch.
The pirate ghost ship fires off a cannon shot and the townsfolk dive out of the way. Some of them are killed on impact.
The pro-war and anti-war factions fight over the Iraq war.
The town reenacts the Civil War
Mr. Hankey summons up massive amounts of crap in order to get rid of the Hollywood gliterati
Mecha-Streisand fights off Ultura Marutin and Megara Poatia.
Stan
[stops reminiscing, turns around, and walks back to the boys] We can't let them do it, you guys! We have to find a way to stop those Native Americans!
The boys
Yeah!
Alex
Yeah, this is our town!
Stan
We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
Kyle, Butters, Tweek
Yeah!
Cartman
That's right!
Butters
Yeah, ahh, that's right!
Alex
Yeah, we're a team!
Stan
We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! [the boys start thinking]
Cartman
[rises and moves to the sidewalk] Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go! [trots off excitedly. The other boys just watch him leave. Cartman returns a few seconds later] No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
Stan
We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
Butters
Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? [smiles]
Kyle
Dog parade?
Butters
Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street. [closes his eyes and beams] It'll be so adorable!
Kyle
How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
Butters
Oh... Uh well, we could sell tickets to our moms and dads.
Stan
Our moms and dads are the ones who need money, Butters!
Butters
Oh... [the boys go back to thinking]
Cartman
Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
South Park, later on, day. The Broflovski house is shown, and a massive bulldozer rolls up to knock it down. A large chunk of it is torn off by the scoop.
Sheila
Oh, Gerald, I, I can't watch!
Randy
[walks up to the Chief] How can you do this to people?
Runs with Premise
We're sorry. But if we do not build a superhighway, our casino might stop seeing profits.
Randy
There's more to life than profits!
Runs with Premise
Well like what?
Randy
Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff. [more of the house is torn down]
Chris
Well, come on, honey, I guess we should start packing up our things as well.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah. [begins to wave] So long, South Park.
Stan
Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
Chris
A dog parade? [smiles in anticipation]
Stan
No!
Randy
Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.
Stan
I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
Kyle
[opens a book he's carrying and reads] The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one. [looks up and closes the book] That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
Sheila
Boys, that's ridiculous.
Stan
Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.
Chef
What do you guys think?
Jimbo
It's a long shot.
Randy
Yeah. [turns around and makes fists with determination] But it's the only shot we've got to save our town.
Three Feathers Casino, that night. The townsfolk are there once more.
Runs With Premise
[reading from a newspaper] The residents of South Park had hoped to raise three hundred thousand dollars. but in the end managed to raise only ten. The loss of their town may be imminent for the poor people of South Park. [fakes sadness] Awww, I think I'm going to cwy.
Two Elders
HA ha ha ha! HA ha ha ha!
The doors open and the townsfolk surge in. Randy carries a large amount of yellow chips.
Randy
All right, boys. You're gonna have to wait here. [the adults begin to move past the boys]
Stan
Dad. [Randy turns around] Good luck.
Randy
It's in God's hand now. [turns around and moves forward] Stand aside, everyone! [the adults move towards the roulette table. The Chief notices a change in atmosphere and rises to see what's going on from his office.]
Runs With Premise
What are they doing?
Randy
We're gonna try and beat you at your own game, Chief Runs With Premise! Ten thousand dollars! [sets the yellow chips down] On thirty one black! [moves the chips towards the number. Everyone gasps. The dealer takes the chips and puts them away, substituting some blue chips for the yellow ones.]
Runs With Premise
Impossible!
Stan
[begins to wish hard] Come on! Come on! [the dealer starts the wheel and tosses the ball in the opposite direction. Everyone looks on in anticipation. The ball slows down and settles in on thirty one black.]
Runs With Premise
Thirty one. Black. [the town erupts with joy]
Townsfolk
Yeah! All right! Woohoo! Oh we did it! We did it! Oh my God! Oh this is amazing!
Runs With Premise
No... NOOO! [The boys cheer. Cartman and Kenny hug]
Alex
South Park is saved. [the dealer adds more blue chips to the amount bet]
Mr. Mackey
We have plenty enough to save our town now!
Gerald
Yeah! But wait. [the rush of winning gets to him] Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. That means if we won again, it will be twelve and a quarter million! [the people gasp a bit at the possibility]
Mr. Garrison
We can save the town and be super-rich!
Randy
Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!
Gerald
Let it ride!!
Townsfolk
Woohoo! Yeah! [they stay with thirty one black, and the dealer spins again]
Kyle
What the hell are they doing??
Jimbo
Let's go thirty one! Let's see it! [the ball bounces around and settles in on two red.]
Roulette Dealer
Two, red. You lose.
Townsfolk
AWWWWWWW!!
Randy
Dammit!
Runs With Premise
[satisfied with this result] Hmmm! [walks off]
Stan
They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
The road. The Marshes drive home in their car. Randy drives, Sharon sits on the passenger side. Stan sits between Shelly and Grandpa in the back seat.
Stan
You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
Randy
Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
Stan
A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!
Randy
Stan? Okay?
Stan
What???
Randy
All right? Stan? Okay?
Stan
You people just got greedy, like the Native Americans! [Randy brakes the car angrily]
Randy
[menacingly] Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?! [turns and faces Stan] Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians! [turns back to the wheel] I'm sorry, Native Americans.
South Park, next day. A "SOLD" sign is placed above the town sign, indicating that the town, indeed, has been sold. At South Park Elementary, the residents stand in long lines waiting for the checks being offered for their homes.
Elder 2
[facing Mr. Garrison] There you are, sir. There's the check for your home. Just sign here, and here.
Mr. Garrison
[signing] Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless.
Mr. Slave
[sobbing] Jesus! Jesus Christ!
Stan
[walks up to Randy, who is in line with the others] Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
Randy
Stanley, we don't have a choice. The Native Americans own South Park now. We have to take what they'll give us for our homes.
Elder 3
There you go. Have a nice day. [hands a check to Liane, who turns around and walks off with it]
Stan
[walks with his friends to a clearing where he could be heard] Come on, you guys! This is our town!
Mr. Mackey
It's over, Stanley. What else can we do?
Stan
We can stay. And fight.
Cartman
Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Alex
Yeah! They don't own our town! We do!
Chef
I'm sorry, boys. You just don't understand economics.
Randy
It'll be okay, boys, we'll just... move to the next town over.
Stan
Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now! [the adults look back helplessly] Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! [the boys leave. Cartman stays behind.]
Cartman
You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! [follows his friends them out. The adults just watch]
South Park, day. Moments later, a train of bulldozers roll down into town. Runs with Premise, riding on the lead bulldozer, looks happy until he sees the boys standing abreast on the street, blocking the way.
Runs with Premise
Get out of our way.
Stan
No! We won't let you destroy our town!
Runs with Premise
Boys. It isn't your town anymore.
Stan
Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
Elder 1
Well your way of life is about to change, little boys. Now move! [points the way to the side of the street]
Kyle
You can't just roll into places and take people's lives away!
A Driver
And what are four little boys going to do to stop us, huh? [the boys stand unsure, but a sound rises up behind them. Townsfolk appear in mass and walk down the street.]
Townsfolk
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
[Stan looks behind him, smiles, then looks up to his left. People now appear on the roofs of the buildings as well as on the street.]
Searching our hearts for so lohh-oo-ohh-oo-ong
[Stan looks at the roofs on the other side of the street, smiling.]
All of us knowing...
[The boys grin]
Love Is A Battlefield

Stan
This land is not for sale.
Runs with Premise
Dammit! I thought you said they were dealt with!
Elder 1
They were!
Mr. Garrison
Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!
Principal Victoria
Filthy bastard Native American money!
Mr. Garrison
Uh oh, right, huh. Sorry about that.
Runs with Premise
This isn't over! [he and the others get into their bulldozers and pull out of town]
Jimbo
We'll never give up! You bastards!
Alex
Yeah! South Park is ours.
Mr. Mackey
But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.
Randy
We can stand here as long as it takes. [no one moves. The scene stays for a few seconds, then...]
Three Feathers Casino, night. Chief Runs with Premise looks over the casino floor from his office.
Runs with Premise
What is the state of our people?
Elder 2
Last night I spoke with the spirit of the bear, and Bear said that if we do not build our highway soon, our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino.
Elder 1
Yes, and Eagle says the cumulative shared market loss on the revenue of the new casino drops fifteen percent every day.
Runs with Premise
Then we must force the South Park people off their petty land.
Elder 1
But they are determined and proud. And the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force, it could be a publicity nightmare, further hurting our net assets.
Runs with Premise
I already have a plan how we can force them off their land... sneakily. [begins to move off] We're going to give them... [stops in front of a wall] blankets. [three of them are shown]
Elder 1
Blankets?
Runs with Premise
Yes. We will present the blankets as a peace offering. But what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with SARS. [his fellow tribespeople look at each other] They will all get SARS! And then SARS will run through their town like a buffalo. Now I need your help getting the SARS onto the blankets. [everyone puts on their little white face masks] Okay, bring them in!
Runs with Premise
[The office doors open and several naked Chinese men are brought in] Let's see how South Park deals with this! [he picks up one of the men and rubs him on a blanket. The Chinese man looks at him bewildered] Everyone grab a Chinese person and rub them on a blanket. [other elders pick up the other Chinese them and carry them over to other blankets hanging on the wall] Make sure you rub them all over. Get the SARS nice and deep in there. [the Chinese men grumble at their treatment]
South Park, next day. The deadline has arrived.
Field Reporter
Tom, I'm standing in chilly South Park, Colorado, where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop Native Americans from building a superhighway through their town. The temperature is low, but spirits are pretty low, too. [a Three Casinos Humvee rolls into town and four elders, including Runs with Premise, exit the vehicle]
Randy
[looking on suspiciously, huddled with his family] What do they want?
Mr. Garrison
We're not moving, ass-faces!
Runs with Premise
[walks up to Mr. Garrison with a blanket] Free blanket? [presents it to him] Though I know we have differences, we believe that a compromise can be reached. In the meantime, it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold. Will you not take this offering as a gesture of good-will?
Mr. Garrison
You had me at "free blanket." [Runs with Premise nods and Garrison takes the blanket and opens it. Runs with Premise moves on to other townsfolk and the other elders join in, passing out blankets to the townsfolk.]
Elders
Free blanket? Free blanket? Free blanket...
Field Reporter
Tom, it now looks as if the Native Americans are handing out blankets as a sign of good-will towards the South Park people. What an incredible display of compassion. I certainly hope there's nothing sinister behind it.
Runs with Premise
[walks up to Randy] Please. As a token of good faith.
Randy
You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
Runs with Premise
It is only a blanket, Mister Marsh.
Randy
Well, thanks. [takes the blanket and opens it up. The Chief walks away]
Runs with Premise
Oh. You're welcome.
South Park, day, later. People are anywhere from asleep to sick.
Field Reporter
[leaning to his left] Tom, it's Tuesday morning now, and the outbreak of SARS in South Park has reached epic proportions. [coughs twice and sniffs] The entire town has been quarantined by the federal government, nobody allowed in our out, which means, nobody can come to our aid. [sniffs twice] It appears this town, and this reporter, are done for. Coming up next, choosing the right hair conditioner. What you don't know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle.
Randy has taken ill and now lies under a lean-to. Sharon sits on one side of the lean-to, Shelly on the other. Stan walks up to his dad with a can of beer in his hand. Randy coughs.
Stan
It's all right, dad.
Randy
How's your... mother?
Stan
[looks over] She's hanging in there. [looks at Randy again] Here, drink some beer. [Randy turns his head aside a bit so he can take a sip, then resets his head]
Randy
It's cool on my tongue.
Stan
You're gonna be all right.
Randy
Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.
Stan
No, Dad, NO.
Randy
Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us. [coughs and sniffs] Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. [runs out of air, then turns aside and breathes in. His voice turns raspy]
Stan
What can I do?
Randy
You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.
Stan
Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!
Randy
The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellow Creek. Now go. GO! [Stan steps away, then runs. Randy relaxes and lays down]
Bellocreek Trailer Park. Stan approaches it and enters. He walks up to a trailer and knocks on the door.
Wise Man
[answers the door] What?
Stan
Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-
Wise Man
Your coming was foretold to me. You've come to save our people. Come in. [steps aside and Stan enters] Watch the cats.
Stan
Uh so, do you know how to cure SARS?
Wise Man
Me?? Huh, no. I am just a guide. Sit down.
[Stan sits down on a bucket seat from a car. Beer bottles litter the trailer floor. The walls are dingy. An open doorway reveals the man's bedroom, which shows a cross hanging on the opposite wall. A poster of a swimsuit model posing on a car hangs on the living room wall. The man sits on the couch].
Wise Man
You must find the answer yourself, by taking an inward journey. [picks up a can of paint thinner and pours it into a brown paper bag]
Stan
An inward journey? That sounds kinda gay.
Wise Man
Let the voices of our ancestors show you the way. [offers the bag to Stan] Breathe. Breathe from the bag of visions. [Stan takes the bag, looks at it, then takes a deep breath from it]
Stan
[disgusted] Ah! Oh, dude!
Three Feathers Casino, night. Chief Runs with Premise holds a meeting in his second-story office.
Runs with Premise
How much longer must we wait for our superhighway??
Elder 1
SARS has spread throughout the entire town of South Park, Chief Runs with Premise. Their wills will break soon.
Runs with Premise
Then I suppose we must be patient.
Woman
Runs with Premise, come quickly!
Runs with Premise
What is the matter, wife?
Woman
It is our son, Premise Running Thin. He is very sick.
Premise Running Thin's bedroom. He's in bed, wearing a headband with a feather attached to it. His parents approach.
Runs with Premise
Premise Running Thin, what is the matter?
Woman
He, he shared a cup with one of the people from China. He has SARS!
Runs with Premise
No! I told you not to touch them!
Premise Running Thin
Papa. Papa...
Medicine Man
[wearing a wolf skin over his head and back] I have given him herbs from the desert plant and water from the cactus of life. But nothing seems to be working.
Runs with Premise
This would not have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away! No more waiting around! Tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan! Shock and Awe!
South Park, next day. The townspeople are still sick. Stan runs up to Randy.
Stan
Dad! Dad!
Randy
Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
Stan
Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS. [reaches into the bag and pulls out each item as he names it] Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
Randy
Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! [a few hours later, everyone is standing around enjoying the soup, soda, and medicine prescribed, and chatting]
Kyle
Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
Alex
Thanks to you, we're all safe now, Stan.
In the distance the bulldozers return and a yell is heard. As the bulldozers draw near, Chief Runs with Premise is seen standing on the running board of the lead bulldozer.
Runs with Premise
Now, I will blow your weak, SARS-infested bodies off the Earth! [the townsfolk look at the coming vehicles and slowly close ranks] What the? [thinks quickly] Wait a minute. [to his men] Stop! Stop! [hops off the bulldozer and walks up to the people] Your, your SARS. Where did it go?
Randy
We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
Runs with Premise
My son... Premise Running Thin has the SARS as well. [makes a truce sign with his hands] You... you can cure him?
Three Feathers Casino, upstairs. Premise Running Thin sits in bed sipping his soup. A can of Sprite and some Dayquil are on his tray. Around his bed are the Three Feathers tribe on one side, the South Park residents on the other.
Elder 1
It is amazing. All our plants and herbs failed to heal him.
Elder 2
But your people's remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart. Perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life.
Randy
We're a simple people. All we want is to be allowed to live our lives.
Runs with Premise
You have cured Premise Running Thin. In return, I shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino. [his wife nudges him with her elbow a few times and he gets irritated] All right, all right, I will not build a superhighway through your town. And you can all have your homes back.
Townsfolk
All right! Yeah! [townspeople jump and cheer. Sheila and Gerald hug each other.] Woohoo!
Alex
Well, I guess we all learned that South Park is more than just a town. It's a community that nobody can split up.
Stan
Dude, who the hell are you?
Alex
Alex. Alex Glick. I got to come on and do the guest voice thingy.
Kyle
What?! Get the hell out of here!
Alex
Hi Mom! Hi Dad! Hi Jill!
End of Red Man's Greed

South Park is Gay!
South Park, school bus stop, morning. Stan, Cartman and Kenny wait for the bus. Stan is dressed in fishnet tank top, artsy pants, and a new, furry cap with the same colors as his old one. Cartman is dressed in a Madonna fashion shirt and artsy pants. His hair is tussled and brighter than usual. Kenny is dressed in a purple parka with light purple sleeves. A lock of his hair peeks out from under the hood.
Stan
Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
Cartman
What? Tell us?
Stan
So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
Cartman
Oh my Gosh, are you serious? That was the cutest top ever!
Stan
I know!
Kenny
(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
Stan
Oh, tell me about it, Ken doll.
Kyle
[joins them, but dressed as usual] Hey dudes. [the others glance at him]
Cartman
[begins to laugh at him] What a dork!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! [laughs heartily]
Kyle
Well, but, this is the jacket I always wear.
Stan
You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.
Cartman
Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. [Stan inspects Kyle's jacket]
Stan
Oohh my God, you got splotches on your neck. Are you using any exfoliating products at all??
Cartman
We can't let Kyle out in public like this, you guys.
Kenny
(That's the truth.)
Stan
Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! [the boys excitedly pull Kyle along to South Park Mall]
Montage
Singers (Widelife)
You... came into my life... and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
It's true. You bring out the best in me.
When you are around, when you are around, all things just keep getting better.
It keeps getting better. Life keeps getting better and better (All things just keep getting better).

The Broflovski house. Gerald and Sheila watch TV from their couch
Announcer
Coming up on HBC, it's Queer Eye for the Straight Guy!
Carson
[a shot of Queer Eye...] We have got to get you some tighter-fitting shirts!
Announcer
[the night's schedule pops up over the scene] Then it's Boy Meets Boy, followed by Will and Grace, and then, the Love Boat... with Men.
Sheila
My goodness, there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days.
Gerald
Yeah. I think it's great that gays are finally being so accepted. [the door opens and the four newly-clothed boys enter]
Kyle
[waves] Hi Mom, Hi Dad!
Gerald
[looks and jumps to his feet] HAAAAAA!!! [walks over to Kyle] Kyle! What's happened to you??
Kyle
I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! [leads the others boys out of the living room]
Gerald
Oh my God! Come on, Sheila! [she rises] We'd better go tell the other parents what's going on!! [they leave.]
The Marsh house. Gerald is pounding on the front door and Sharon answers.
Sharon
Oh hi Gerald, Sheila.
Gerald
Hi Sharon. Uh, we need to talk to you about the boys.
Sharon
Sure. Come on in. The guys are all watching TV.
Gerald
Oh, is the game on or something? [they move towards the sofa, where a bunch of the men are watching]
Randy
[moves over to Gerald and hugs him] Heeey Geraaald! How are youuuu!! [the other men greet him as well]
Other Men
Geraaald! Hi Gerald.
Stuart
Sit down, Jer-Jer! Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is on.
Gerald
Oh no! Y-you guys all turned gay too?? [the other men laugh]
Randy
Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.
Gerald
What's that?
Skeeter
Just because a guy cares about how he looks and is in touch with his feminine side doesn't mean he's gay anymore.
Stuart
Yeah. Metrosexual means you're straight, but you appreciate the gay culture.
Randy
It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?
The ladies look on from the kitchen.
Sharon
Don't our men look
Linda
Haven't you seen Queer Eye For the Straight Guy, Sheila? These five gay men go around and show straight men how to better themselves. It's the best.
Sheila
It is?
Sharon
Well sure, Sheila. Our husbands are all so clean and neat. My Randy irons his clothes and even has pedicures.
Linda
And they like to talk about their feeling now and drink wine and decorate the house.
Sarah
My Steven shaved his chest and his balls. Oooh, I love it!
Sharon
And how about our boys, huh? Ever since gay culture became cool, our boys bathe every night and brush their teeth three times a day. This is the greatest thing ever.
Sheila
I don't know. Sometimes boys take cultural fads too far...
South Park, day. The boys go to school in their new threads. They stop at the main entrance.
Stan
Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
Cartman
That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
Kenny
(Woohoo!!)
Stan
All right. Let's work it! [shimmies a bit. The boys turn and pass through the entrance, but stop in their tracks.] What the...?
Butters
Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classes.
Connor
Okay, sweetums. [they part ways. Butters goes off to his right. Farther away, near the drinking fountains, stand Timmy, Jimmy, Kevin, and Pip]
Clyde
Oh my God, where is my homework?! I am freaking out! [turns right and follows after Butters. The boys look on in stunned silence]
A Boy
Hey dudes. [the boys look and it's Craig with Token, Jason, and Tweek]
Stan
Hey Craig.
Craig
You guys look pretty gay.
Kyle
[happily] Thanks.
Craig
[him and his group are not happy about it] Not as gay as us, though.
Cartman
[moves in front of Kyle] Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
Craig
Oh yeah?! We're super duper triple-dog gay!
Cartman
Oh yeah?! We're all ultra super stamp it stamp it no erasies mega gay!
Chef
[arrives] What's all this fightin' about, children?!
Stan
These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
Chef
Aw nah. Don't tell me you children have taken up this whole metrosexual fad, too.
Stan
Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
Chef
No it isn't. Last year you children were all trying to be black, and now you're trying to be gay!
Stan
We're metrosexual!!
Craig
Maybe. But you'll never be as metrosexual as us! Come on, fags! [snaps his fingers and his group follows him away]
Cartman
GOD I HATE CRAIG!! [Stan and Kenny turn to leave] That son of a... djah!! [leaves. Kyle turns to leave, but has second thoughts.]
Kyle
Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.
Chef
Well, then, don't buy into this fad, Kyle. Be who you are, not what's cool.
Mr. Garrison's class, next day. He enters. On the blackboard are two math problems: one addition, one subtraction.
Mr. Garrison
All right children, let's take our seats.
Class
[in unison] Good morning Mr. Garrison. [their dulcet tones get his attention, and he turns around]
Mr. Garrison
Well, uh d-don't you all look nice.
Timmy
[responds, gestures gaily with his hands] Oooo, Timmy. [the door opens and Kyle enters. A closeup of the boys as Kyle goes to his seat]
Stan
Dude! W-what are you doing?
Kyle
I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
Craig
HA! Told you you guys were straight!
Stan
We're not straight! You're straight!
Jason, Craig, Tweek, Token
You're straight!
Cartman
You're straight like a freeway!
Mr. Garrison
What the hell is going on??
Cartman
You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
Craig
I'm not just gay, I'm a catamite. [Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny stay silent, looking at each other]
Cartman
...So? I'm half bisexual!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!
Cartman
I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
Mr. Garrison
WHAT??
Nighttime. Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave walk down the street.
Mr. Garrison
It was the craziest thing I've ever seen, Mr. Slave. All the children were suddenly acting like being gay was cool. I mean, maybe we're not the only gay couple in town anymore. [they cross the cross street and enter the bar at the corner]
Mr. Slave
Oh, Jesus Christ.
The bar, inside. Disco music is playing. Mr. Garrison looks in awe at the metrosexuals now milling about.
Mr. Garrison
Look at that, Mr. Slave. [a pan shot of the people there. He puts his hands over his mouth] Our cup runneth over.
Mr. Slave
[puts his right hand over his mouth] Jesus Christ.
Jimbo
[standing with Ned at the bar] Mr. Garrison, those are great pants.
Mr. Garrison
Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too. [cuddles up to him] Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?
Jimbo
Uh, for what?
Mr. Garrison
Well, you know...
Jimbo
No.
Mr. Garrison
Huh.
Randy
Mr. Garrison! [Garrison and Slave walk over] Hey doll.
Mr. Garrison
Oh hey Randy.
Randy
You're looking ultra-fabulous.
Mr. Garrison
Well thanks. You too. [leans in a bit] So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?
Randy
[turns his back to Mr. Garrison and walks away] Nuno, thanks, I'm, I'm not like that.
Mr. Garrison
Not, not like that?
Richard
[approaches, carries some glasses of wine] How about some shirazz, guys? [Garrison and Slave each take a glass]
Mr. Garrison
Uh-Oh, thanks, Mr. Tweek.
Richard
My pleasure, silly-buns.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, wuh, well uh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.
Richard
Why?
Mr. Garrison
Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.
Mr. Slave
Woohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ.
Richard
Wohohoho, goodness no. I, I'm straight.
Mr. Garrison
Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!
Patrons
Huh?
Mr. Garrison
Why won't anybody pound Mr. Slave's butt?!
Randy
Well, we don't "pound butt," Mr. Garrison, we're straight.
Mr. Garrison
Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
Jimbo
Hey, now that's not true. My shoes don't say I pound butt.
Mr. Garrison
No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!
Skeeter
So, Mr. Garrison. We learned that gays are totally cool. You're just one of us now.
Patrons
Yeah.
Mr. Garrison
One of you?! [throws his glass down] We've spent our whole lives tryin' NOT to be one of you! You can't do this to us!!
South Park Elementary, playground, day.
Cartman
Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
Stan
Wow, is that from Origins?
Cartman
Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
Kyle
[approaches with a football] Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
Cartman
Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second? [pulls Stan and Kenny away from Kyle] Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
Stan
Well, what can we do about it?
Cartman
We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
Stan
What?? That's stupid. We wouldn't have to kill Kyle! We would just to tell him not to hang around us anymore.
Cartman
Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
Stan
Yeah. Wait, what?
Cartman
You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
Craig
[approaches with his friends] Hey, butch boy. Nice football you got there. [they laugh at him]
Token
When was the last guy you had a manicure, straight man? [Kyle picks up his football]
Jason
Yeah, let's see that hair. [lifts up Kyle's hat] Look, he's not even using any product! [he and the others laugh at him. Other boys gather in and join in the laughter]
Stan
[returns with Cartman and Kenny] Hey, what's goin' on?
Craig
Oh, here come the butch boys to help their butchy little friend!
Cartman
He's not our friend. [Stan's jaw drops a bit. Cartman looks at Stan and walks away. Kenny follows]
Kyle
Stan? [Stan looks at Kyle, sighs, and walks away]
Jason
[shoves Kyle a bit] This playground is for metrosexuals, macho man!
Craig
Take your non-flaming ass to some other school! [the other boys gather round Kyle and gang up on him]
Kyle
No! Ah!
South Park sign, now with a bed of flowers under it.
The Broflovski house. Kyle returns with bruises all over his body. His mom is dusting.
Sheila
[sees him and drops her duster to kneel next to him] Kyle! What happened to you?!
Kyle
[sniffs] I got beat up at school... for being different.
Sheila
WHAT?? Your classmates beat you up for being a Jew?
Kyle
No! For not being a metrosexual.
Sheila
Gerald! Gerald, get down here!
Gerald
[upstairs. Disco music plays] Here I come! [dances down the stairs, then moonwalks right back up, then strikes a pose.]
Kyle
Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
Gerald
Kyle! You look terrible! [walks down and approaches him]
Sheila
The boys at school beat him up, Gerald.
Gerald
Oh, really?! Well, don't you worry, Kyle. We can cover that black eye up with some cream base, and the coat and pants we'll bleach with an acid wash for a fun vintage look.
Kyle
Gah! Just leave me alone! [walks away and passes the TV]
A voice
There you go! Now you look fabulous.
Kyan
You see that? A spray-on tan does wonders for your look.
Kyle
GRRRRR!!
Thom
Now let's get down to the tango class and learn some new steps. [the straight man smiles]
Kyle
That does it! I know what I have to do! [walks off]
Chef's house, day. Mr. Garrison rings the bell.
Chef
Oh, hello, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
[sadly] Chef, can I talk to you?
Chef
Sure. Come on in.
Mr. Garrison
Thanks. Come, Slave. [yanks Mr. Slave in by a leash around his neck. Both men sit on Chef's couch. Mr. Slave buries his face in his hands] Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!
Mr. Slave
[sobs] Oh Jesus! Jesus Christ!
Chef
Well, what do you want me to do about it?
Mr. Garrison
Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?
Chef
Oh. Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.
Mr. Slave
[straightens up] How did you do that?
Chef
Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, "I'm in the house" instead of "I'm here." But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying that, and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."
Mr. Garrison
[slumps forward] We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing. [thinks] Wait. [rises] That's it! I know exactly what to do! [yanks on Mr. Slave's leash] Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. [exits the front door with Mr. Slave]
Chef
Oh no! Damnit! Don't call it that! [the door closes]
South Park Train Station. Kyle approaches a ticket booth.
Kyle
One ticket to New York, please.
Clerk
[handing a ticket over] You're going to New York alone?
Kyle
I'm going to see the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people.
Clerk
Oooo, great idea! They can help you with those dated clothes.
Kyle
Mrrh.
Kyle walks away, then unsheathed a sharp knife. He enters the train. Inside, he walks down the aisle until he sees a bench. He hops onto it and sits down. A few seconds later, he notices the two men to his left, then looks up in recognition: they are Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave. Mr. Garrison is carrying his own knife.
Kyle
Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
Kyle, what are you doing here?
Kyle
I'm going to New York to kill the Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people!
Mr. Garrison
What?? That's what I'm doing!
Kyle
Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
Mr. Garrison
They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
Kyle
I thought of it first!
Mr. Garrison
No you didn't! No you didn't!
Kyle
Did so! Did so!
Mr. Garrison
I thought of it yesterday!
Kyle
I thought of it two days ago!
Mr. Garrison
I thought of it before you were born!
Mr. Slave
Stop it, you two! Stop it! Don't you see how crazy this is?
Mr. Garrison
Oh. [sigh] You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.
Kyle
Cool.
South Park Mall, day. The boys are at a clothing store.
Stan
Wow, we look great!
Cartman
Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
Randy
Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men! [leaves. The boys follow him out. Randy calls out to the other men in the mall] Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! [their wives sit on benches in the center of the mall with nothing to do]
Richard
Oh my God!
Man
Let's go! Let's go!
Ryan
[walking down the far side of the mall] You guys have got to see these shoes I bought!
Gerald
Hurry, you guys! The mall closes in seven hours!
Jimbo
Oh, why can't we all live at the mall?!
Sharon
You know, I'm starting to think this whole metrosexual thing isn't so great.
Linda
I know what you mean. All my husband ever does now is look at himself in the mirror. He cares more about how he looks than how I look.
Mrs. Tweek
I hope something happens soon to put an end to this whole fad.
HBC Television Headquarters, New York. The head of programming is with the Queer Eye guys.
Head of Programming
Guys, you've done a terrific job. Queer Eye For the Straight Guy is our number one show! [the guys cheer]
Carson
What can I say? We're fabulous.
Head of Programming
You guys are changing the world! And tomorrow, we're gonna have you make over the President of the United States!
Jai
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna faint. [a knock is heard at the door, then it opens]
Mr. Garrison
Room service. [a service cart rolls in]
Head of Programming
What? We didn't order any room service.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, well, the woman at the front desk sent it up.
Head of Programming
Carol? [lifts the platter's lid for a brief peek, then lowers it] Well, I'll have to check on this. Excuse me a minute, fellas. [leaves. Mr. Garrison continues inside the office when the coast is clear. He takes the cart to the desk and parks it there. Kyle pops out and rushes to lock the door]
Kyle
Clear!
Mr. Garrison
[whips out his walkie-talkie and speaks into it] Okay, Mr. Slave! [From a nearby building Mr. Slave swings down like Spiderman and crashes through the window, but passes out on impact. His body collapses on the floor]
Mr. Slave
Unh, Jesus [a chunk of window falls onto his ass] Christ.
Mr. Garrison
Well crap, that didn't work.
South Park Mall, day. Stan and his group face off against Craig and his group at the center of the mall.
Stan
You'd better shut up, Craig.
Craig
Everyone knows it's true!
Stan
It is not!
Craig
Is so!
Tom
Craig! Behave yourself!
Randy
Yeah, Stanley. What are you fighting about?
Stan
Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
Randy
What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
Tom
Yeah. Everyone already knows I dress better than Randy.
Randy
Oh really?!
Tom
I mean, you do have the fashion sense of a Japanese woman.
Men
Ooooo.
Randy
Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.
Other men
Oh no, errrr!
Sharon
Oh, stop it! Will you all just stop it?! [the men fall silent] Look, you guys are carrying this fad too far! Will you please stop acting this way?!
Tom
You don't... like us being metrosexual?
The Women
NO!
Randy
Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
The Males
Yeah!!
Linda
What?
Jimbo
We shouldn't be fighting amongst ourselves, we should be uniting against metrophobes like these!
Sharon
This is crazy!
Randy
[steps forward, past the boys] Crazy? Different? Outcasts? Call us what you want. But us metros are real people, just like you!
Tom
[steps forward, past the boys] You can metrobash us all you want, but we're here to stay!
Craig
[steps forward, past his father] Yeah Mom! We're proud of who we are.
Cartman
[steps forward] That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
Ryan
Great idea, Eric! Raise metrosexual awareness!
Stuart
We can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers!
Kenny
(Woohoohoo!)
Randy
Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
The Males
Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets! Out of the malls and into the streets!
Mrs. Tweek
What the hell did that show do to them?
HBC Television Headquarters, New York. Police have been called in and have apprehended Mr. Garrison, Mr. Slave, and Kyle.
Officer
You sure you don't want to press charges?
Kyan
That's okay, officer. I think they learned murder is wrong.
Carson
Especially in those pants.
Mr. Garrison
[the cops leave] Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!
Jai
Are you crazy?! We're the hottest thing on TV!
Mr. Garrison
But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.
Kyan
Sorry Charlie, no sale. [he and the others turn and walk away]
Mr. Garrison
Buh... but... this doesn't make sense! [grabs his head] How can gay men do this to their own people?? [the Queer Eye guys reach the exit] Unless... you're not gay at all... [the guys stop, turn around, look at Garrison angrily, then return]
Thom
You just had to push it, didn't you?!
Jai
Just had to keep asking question!
Carson
[locks the exit] Now you know the truth!
Kyle
They aren't gay? Then what are they?
Kyan
For a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earth's crust! Banished by man in the Kindling Wars.
Mr. Garrison
Oh my God. [Kyan steps forward and begins to crumble. A walking crab pops out]
Leader
We are the Crab People!
Kyle
AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Mr. Slave
Jesus Christ!
The Queer Eye Guys
[they too crumble and advance] Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!
A subterranean cave. The crab people lead their hostages to their camp.
Crab People
Crab People! Crab People! Crab People!.
Crab Leader
[entirely red] See now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years! But soon we shall rule the land above, and mankind will be gone!
Mr. Garrison
Gone?? ["Crab People! Crab People!"]
Crab Man 2
Crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force, and so we came up with our perfect plan! [another crab person walks over to a closet full of human shells, all of them replicas of the Queer Eye guys. The crab person climbs in a Carson replica and closes the shell behind him. Carson's replica comes to life]
Carson replica
If you can't beat man, [drops down from his hook] change man!
Mr. Garrison
I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! [some crab people restrain him and Mr. Slave]
Crab Leader
When all the world is metrosexual, the crab people shall finally reign supreme!! [raises his pincers and claps. The other crab people join him and clap]
Crab People
Crab People! Crab People!
Crab Solo
Taste like crab, talk like people.
Crab People
Crab People!
Kyle
You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
Crab Man 2
[approaches] Very well. If we can't make you into metrosexuals, then we will make you into crab people! Take them!! [the crab people swarm in and separate the hostages. Some of them take Kyle into Crabwear and select a crab outfit for him to wear. Then they take him to Crab Salon and put antennae on his hat, then they take him to get a facial, then they march him down the underground road]
Singers
(Crab People)
All things just keep getting better
You... came into my life
(Crab People)
and my world never looked so bright. Yeah.
(Crab People)
It's true. You bring out the best in me.

When you are around, when you are around,

All things just keep getting better.

South Park, day. A Metrosexual Pride Parade moves down the street in the background, and News 4 is covering it.
Reporter
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the first Metrosexual Pride Parade is underway! [in a rainbow peacock float Randy, Jimbo, Skeeter and Stuart ride and cheer. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny ride in a banana float which features an ocean wave and a palm tree. On the tree waves a rainbow flag that says "Here to Stay"
The Boys
We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!
We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!

Sharon
[as the boys' voices fade away] That does it! I can't take it anymore!
The Boys
We're here! [clap clap]
We're not queer! [clap clap]
But we're close! [clap clap]
Get used to it!

Linda
I should have never wished for a cleaner, neater husband.
Sharon
Ladies, get your things! I know what we have to do! [leads the ladies away. Randy's float hits a pothole and veers to the right. It hits the sushi restaurant as the spectators back away quickly]
Jimbo
Whoa, look out! [the float hits the building and breaks a window. A small fire is heard]
Randy
Oh my God, it's on fire! [the men jump out of the float and run to the other side of the street]
Skeeter
Put it out! Put it out!
Randy
I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
Skeeter
The heat could really damage our hair. We'd better let the police handle this!
Officer Barbrady
[seated on his patrol car, buffing his nails] Are you crazy? I just had my uniform pressed!
Jimbo
[the float and building are now fully engulfed in flames] Oh Jesus, it's burning! Oh my God!
Skeeter
Eeeek!
Randy
Put it out! Put it out! Fire!
HBC Headquarters, New York. The Queer Eye guys work on President Bush on their show.
Carson
Mr. President, it is such an honor to make you over!
Kyan
Now, we've got to do something with your hair.
Thom
And your nails are filthy. Let's get those clean.
Head of Programming
This is gay gold! [Mr. Garrison, Mr. Slave, and Kyle look down from the sound booth]
Mr. Garrison
Stop them! They're crab people!
Crab Man 3
They cannot see or hear us, foolish man. Now stand by and watch as your pitiful race becomes helpless!!
Carson
That is very good, Mr. President. Now, put on this silk jacket. [Kyan, Jai, and Thom remove the President's coat and Carson hands him the jacket]
Kyle
No Mr. President!! Don't do it! [the crab man holding him quickly covers his mouth] Help!
Mr. Garrison
You bastards!
Kyan
That looks great! Now, how about some moisturizer. [Bush and the guys smile. The studio door bursts open and the women flood into the studio wielding bats]
Sharon
There they are! Get 'em!
Kyan
What? [their smiles vanish]
Linda
You turned our husbands into whiny little wusses!!
Sarah
It's payback time! [the women rush in and start beating up the Queer Eye guys]
Head of Programming
Oh my God, what are they doing?!
Crab Man 3
Oh noooo!! [Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave react and crack the crab people in two in the booth as the women finish Queer Eye guys off below]
Head of Programming
[kneeling at the corpses of Carson and Kyan] Wha? What have you done?
Sharon
We're sorry, but we didn't have a choice. You see, at first we liked having our men be clean and neat. We thought that having them use product in their hair and wanting facials would make them sexier. But it doesn't.
Linda
That's right. Event though my Steven sickens me out sometimes, it's his rugged manly grossness that I'm attracted to.
Sarah
We're sorry, but we knew that the only answer was tuh kill the Queer Eye guys.
Head of Programming
Well you're going to jail for thi-! [Kyan's body begins to move, and the HoP looks down] Wait a minute. [a crab man crawls out] What is that?
Crab Leader
No! Our evil plans! Noooo... [dies]
Head of Programming
Oh my God. They were crab people.
Mr. Garrison
[enters the studio with Slave and Kyle in tow] Yes! They were trying to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
Kyle
Mom!
Sheila
Kyle!
Head of Programming
I should have known they were crab people. They tried this before with The Jefferson.
Mr. Garrison
So now, can you please change your network's programming?
Head of Programming
Yes. Yes, I think this gay fad is over. Gentlemen, back to Studio 12! We're gonna bring back the Latin fad.
South Park. The sign has been redrawn with a barrio graffiti font.
The McCormick house, day. Randy, Jimbo, Skeeter, and Stuart are now dressed as cholos on the porch. Two six-packs of Coronas are on the ground. Some of the bottles are already empty.
Randy
Hey eses.
Stuart
Hey hefe. You want some cerveza? [hands Randy a beer.]
South Park Elementary, day. Kyle walks into view in the school hall.
Stan
Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
Kyle
What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
Stan
Yeah. It's cool, holmes.
Kyle
No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
Stan
Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. [turns and walks away]
Cartman
Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! [turns and walks away. Kenny just looks at him and walks off. Kyle looks away, then back at the boys, then walks away in the opposite direction. He stops, thinks for a while, then turns around and hurries to them]
Kyle
God-damnit!
End of South Park is Gay!

Christian Rock Hard
Stan and the boys are in the Marsh garage belting out tunes, but their musical styles are scattered. Cartman sings lead, Stan and Kyle on are guitars, Kenny is on the drums.
Cartman
God dammit! [hangs his head and lets the mic stand fall into his left hand. All stop playing and the side door opens]
Randy
[looks in] Stan, are you okay?
Stan
Yeah, dad. We're just rehearsing our band. [Cartman straightens up]
Randy
Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. [steps back and closes the door]
Cartman
[cackling] Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
Kyle
He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
Kenny
(What? Is it?)
Stan
Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. [Cartman paces the floor with arms behind his back]
Kyle
I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
Cartman
[stops] Inspiration. Wait a minute, [turns right and walks away from them] that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
Stan
See what?
Cartman
[turns around] Our band should play Christian rock! [beams with pride]
Kyle
Christian rock?!
Cartman
[races back to the band] Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
Kyle
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
Cartman
[protests, takes a step towards Kyle] It worked for Creed!
Stan
I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
Cartman
[steps towards Stan] You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
Kyle
[pointing to an exit] Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
Cartman
Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
Kyle
You're on, fat boy!
Cartman
Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! [runs out as fast as his fat little body will let him, and pants]
Kyle
[after a few seconds of watching the door] What a stupid asshole!
The neighborhood, day. Cartman runs through the streets. He appears over a rise on one of the streets.
Cartman
Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! [runs up to a house and pounds on the front door. The door opens up and it's Butters who answers]
Butters
Oh, hi Eric.
Cartman
Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! [dashes off]
Butters
[watching Cartman run off] ...Ohhh!
Token's mansion. Cartman runs up to the front door.
Cartman
No time to waste! Platinum album! Must beat Kyle! [pounds on the door and Token answers] Token! Get the bass guitar out of your basement and meet me over at my house! [turns around and dashes off]
Token
What?! We don't have a bass guitar.
Cartman
[spins around] Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! [runs off. Token gets annoyed and shuts the door]
Cartman's house. He and Butters are in the living room. Cartman is at the piano, Butters is on drums.
Butters
Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... inspiration.
Cartman
Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. [makes changes to the sheet music on the piano's sheet music holder]
Token
[arrives with a bass and a small amplifier] Hey, there was a bass guitar in my basement.
Cartman
I told you, Token.
Token
So, what are we doing?
Cartman
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
Butters
Wow!
Cartman
We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
Butters
[his smile vanishes and he slumps in his chair] Awww.
Token
[moves towards the front door] I'm out. [picks up his amp]
Cartman
Wait! [Token stops, Cartman rushes over] Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- [points to Butters]
Butters
Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
Cartman
Still want to leave, Token? [Token thinks a bit, then resumes his place] Thank you.
The Broflovski house, living room. Gerald and Sheila are on the sofa. Gerald reads a book, Sheila is knitting.
Kyle
[enters and stands before them] Dad, can I borrow three hundred dollars?
Gerald
Three hundred dollars?? What in the world for??
Kyle
Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
Gerald
Sorry Kyle, we gave you your allowance already.
Kyle
Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
Gerald
It wasn't your life yesterday. [resumes reading]
Kyle
Hold it. [plaintive] Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
Gerald
The answer is no, Kyle.
Kyle
Aw, come on Dad, don't be such a Jew!
Sheila
Kyle, don't belittle your own people!
Kyle
[turns and walks off in frustration] Aaaargh! [heads for the front door and opens it. Stan and Kenny approach the entrance. It's night out.]
Stan
Hey dude.
Kyle
It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
Stan
No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
Kyle
Really?
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Stan
You got a computer?
Stan's Dad's den, moments later. The boys are at the computer. Stan works the keyboard as Kyle and Kenny watch.
Stan
See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
Kyle
All right, cool. [takes over] Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. [with each name, he clicks on some songs and a download indicator shows download progress for each one. It's an extremely fast connection]
Kenny
(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
Stan
Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
Kyle
[types in the search box] Judas Priest. [a two-tone bell sound indicates a successful download] Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! [immediately, helicopters are heard coming and the light outside turns bright white. A night sun hovers overhead and stops at a position in which the helicopter pilots can see inside the den. Police sirens are then heard]
Stan
What the hell is that?
Kyle
I don't know. [drops from the bench and walks over to a window] Let me go check. [an FBI agent crashes through the window, falls and rolls into a standing position, then aims his firearm at the boys. The boys are startled and jump]
Agent 1
Freeze!! FBI!! [a second agent crashes through the other window and rolls into position as well. A third agent leaps in through the second window]
Agent 2
Down on the ground! Down on the ground! [the boys are herded closer together. Three thumps are heard on the door and more agents break in with a battering ram.]
Agent 3
Hurry up! Let me see those hands! [the boys quickly raise their hands as more agents pour in. The boys are handcuffed]
Agent 2
[into his walkie-talkie] Tango Teamus to Point Bravo! Suspects in custody! [the boys are escorted out of the room]
Agent 4
Move move move move move move! All clear, men! [to the boys] Get your ass going!
Agent 5
Move move move move move move! Move!
Gerald
[appears at the door with Sheila] Kyle, what did you do?!
Kyle
[being herded into an FBI van with the other boys] I don't know!
Cartman's house. He, Token and Butters begin to practice.
Cartman
All right, guys, this is gonna be so easy. All we have to do to make Christian songs is take regular old songs and add Jesus stuff to them. [some sheet music is shown. Cartman has already crossed out the original author's name] See? All we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "Darling" and replace them with [writes next to "baby"] Jesus. All right, Butters, give me a beat. [Butters doesn't understand, but starts drumming. It's rather good] Okay, nice. Very nice. All right, Token, give me a smooth bass line.
Token
I don't know how to play bass. [Butters stops]
Cartman
[Sighs, has his left fist on his forehead, eyes shut] Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
Token
I'm gettin' sick of your stereotypes!
Cartman
Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! [Token begins to play a bass line, then is surprised that he can actually do it, then realizes that Cartman is right]
Token
God-damnit! [Butters joins in and their sounds flow together]
Cartman
 All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. [begins to sing]
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.

Butters
Well done!
United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, day. Inside, a detective reviews some reports on the boys' Internet activity. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny wait on the other side of the table.
Kyle
[some seconds later] Um, sir-
Detective
Shut up!! [the boys jump in their seats, then look down, chagrined] You downloaded a lot of songs! Says here you even downloaded Judas Priest? That's hard time you boys are lookin' at. You got anything to say for yourselves?
Kyle
[rubs the table a bit] We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
Detective
[pissed off] Not a big deal! You think downloading music for free is not a big deal?! Put your coats on! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it!
A mansion, unknown location, day. The agent has taken the boys for a ride and arrived here. He leads them to the main gate.
Detective
This is the home of Lars Ulrich, the drummer for Metallica. [they approach a bush] Look. There's Lars now, sitting by his pool. [he's seen sitting on the edge of a chaise longue, his face in his hands, softly sobbing]
Kyle
What's the matter with him?
Detective
This month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool, but thanks to people downloading his music for free, he must now wait a few months before he can afford it.
Detective
[a close-up of Lars sobbing] Come. There's more. [leads them away. Next seen is a small airport at night] Here's Britney Spears' private jet. Notice anything? [a shot of Britney boarding a plane, then stopping to look at it before entering] Britney used to have a Gulfstream IV. Now she's had to sell it and get a Gulfstream III because people like you chose to download her music for free. [Britney gives a heavy sigh and goes inside.] The Gulfstream III doesn't even have a remote control for its surround-sound DVD system. Still think downloading music for free is no big deal?
Kyle
We... didn't realize what we were doing, eh...
Detective
That is the folly of man. Now look in this window. [they are at another mansion, and they look inside a picture window] Here you see the loving family of Master P. [He's shown tossing a basketball to his wife while his kid tries to catch it] Next week is his son's birthday and, all he's ever wanted was an island in French Polynesia. [his mom lowers the ball and gives it to the boy, who smiles, picks it up and drops it. It rolls away and he goes after it]
Kyle
So, he's gonna get it, right?
Detective
I see an island without an owner. If things keep going the way they are, the child will not get his tropical paradise.
Stan
[apologetically] We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
Detective
[somberly, dramatically] Man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else... I fear... recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury.
Some bluffs by a beach, dawn. Cartman, Token and Butters scramble over some boulders to get to the beach. Seagulls fly overhead.
Cartman
Almost there, you guys.
Butters
Ow...
Token
Why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here?
Cartman
Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover. [sets up his camera on a tripod] The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
Butters
Wow, neato! An album cover! [walks out onto the sand]
Token
[follows Butters onto the sand] This Christian album better make as much money as you said it would, tubby!
Cartman
[when Token seems out of earshot] I'm going to kill you one day, Token.
Token
[spins around] What did you say?! [Cartman is startled]
Cartman
Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. [begins to focus the shot. Butters and Token stand together]
Butters
Cheese!
Cartman
No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! [Butters and Cartman move apart. Token moves off to a boulder a little farther away, Butters moves a bit closer to the camera]
Butters
Cheese!
Cartman
No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
Butters
Oh...
Cartman
Token, look away to the right. [Token looks off to the right] More. [Token turns his head to the right] More!
Token
[turns all his body to the right] Why the hell would I be looking way over there??
Cartman
So it looks like you're too cool to care that you're on an album cover, you black asshole! Now just hold it! [starts the timer, then steps into the shot] Our first album cover.
He raises his hands and head in praise and closes his eyes. The first shot is taken. More album covers. First, the three boys looking down at the camera as if in a football huddle. Next, a shot of the three of them standing in line, frowning. Next, a shot of Cartman making more changes to sheet music, Cartman in his room/home studio making changes with a reel-to-reel player beside him, Cartman on a bus writing new lyrics onto his left palm: "Jesus is awesome. I love him so much. Jesus is great." Cartman playing his changes on the reel-to-reel player to his band-mates. At Butters' house Butters presents Cartman with a fresh print of their first album wrapped in cellophane. Token uses a hair dryer on the CD to shrink-wrap the cellophane in place, and the camera zooms in. While the scenes roll by, Cartman sings.
Cartman
Don't ever leave me, Jesus. I couldn't stand to see you go.
My heart would simply snap, my Lord, if you walked on out that door.
I promise I'll be good to you, and keep you warm at night.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why don't we just... shut off the lights.

The FBI building, next day. The parents have shown up to retrieve the boys.
Gerald
Thanks for releasing them to us, detective. Sorry for all the trouble they caused.
Detective
It's all right. I think these boys learned their lesson.
Stan
Boy, I'll say!
Detective
If you parents will just step over here, you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees.
Randy
Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
Detective
Not a big deal, huh?! Come with me! I'm gonna show you something! And I don't think you're gonna like it! [leads the parents away]
Stan
[walks off in the opposite direction] Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
Kenny
(Yeah)
Kyle
No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
Stan
Oh yeah.
Kyle
Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Kyle's house, day. A reporter stands in front of it waiting to make his report. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny sit on the steps with a sign beside them: "Musicians on Strike".
Field Reporter
Tom, I'm standing in South Park, Colorado, where the rock band, MOOP, has refused to play. The strike started yesterday and could go well into next week.
Cartman
[walks up] Oh hey guys. How's it going?
Kyle
We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
Cartman
[brushes off Kyle's comment] I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band, [brings out the CD] Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
Stan
It is?? [Kyle's jaw drops]
Cartman
That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya! [tugs at one of the lobes on Kyle's hat] Hahahaha ha ha!
Kyle
You get a platinum album for selling one million copies, you fat turd!
Cartman
It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
Kyle
You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
Stan
Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
Cartman
I know enough to exploit it. Just get that ten bucks ready, Kyle. Ta-ta! [walks off]
Kyle
Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
Stan
What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Christ-fest, night. A stadium's parking lot is crowded with all sorts of booths selling stuff.
T-Shirt Vendor
Psalm T-Shirts! Get a T-Shirt with your favorite psalm!
Bible Vendor
Leather-bound bibles. Show your faith.
Cartman
Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
Elderly Woman
Oh, this will be great for my grandchildren. They need hip cool music, but with inspirational lyrics.
Cartman
[takes the woman's body and puts it in the treasurer's box] I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
Butters
Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. [Cartman flashes an angry look at Butters. The woman looks deceived, but she takes the album with her anyway]
Cartman
Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
MC
[the boys look up] All right, everyone! Welcome to Christfest 2003! [the boys leave their booth and enter the stadium] are you ready for some live music? [the crown inside begins to move]
A Man
Yeah Jesus!
MC
Then let's give it up now for one of Christian rock's biggest bands! Trinity! [the lights come up on them]
Trinity
The Shepherd and the Light, and His Word lifted me up
And I praise His Holy Name wherever I go.

Cartman
[listening backstage, moves away a big] Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! [a group of men walk by]
Band Member 1
Hey is this the way to the backstage?
Cartman
Who are you?
Band Member 1
We're the band Sanctified. We play metal and punk, but with lyrics that inspire faith in Christ.
Band Member 2
Yeah. We proved that Christian music can be tough and hard core.
Cartman
Yeah, you guys are real hardcore.
Band Member 1
You bet your gosh-darned rear end we are!
Stage Hand
[stepping in] All right, uhh, Sanctified, you guys are up next.
Band Member 3
Yeah! Let's do it!
Band Member 2
Sent down from Heaven! The Spirit and the Glory!
Cartman
Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
Band Member 2
Well, that, that's cool.
Band Member 1
Always good to be praying before you're playin'.
Cartman
[edges over to a storage room with an open door] Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better. [enters. The members of Sanctified follow him in] Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... [quickly runs out and locks the band in, then props a chair up against the doorknob so the band can't get out]
Butters
Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. [a shot of the stadium's exterior, then of the stands and stage]
MC
All right, Christians, how are you feeling tonight? [the crowd cheers]
Fans
Praise Jesus! Praise him! My Lord!
MC
Let's keep this salvation train going with the hot band, Sanctified!
Stage Hand
[walks up and whispers] That's Faith + 1.
MC
Uh. Uh apparently there's been a change. Give it up for ... Faith + 1! [steps away as the house lights converge on the group. They begin to play]
Cartman
You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
[the fans sway back and forth]
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!

Kyle's house, day. The MOOP boys are still sitting on the steps, sulking, striking.
Stan
[sighs] Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
Kyle
Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
Field Reporter
[the News 4 crew is still there, too] Tom, we're now entering the second day of the rock band MOOP's refusal to play, and the second day of absolutely no other news to report on. In a recent poll we asked people if MOOP's refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the Internet. One percent said yes. Two percent said no. And ninety-seven percent said, "Who the hell is MOOP?!" Back to you, Tom.
Lars Ulrich
[the guys from Metallica approach] Hey, are you the guys protesting free Internet music downloading?
Stan
[awed] Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!
Lars Ulrich
That's right. Metallica is behind you dudes a thousand percent!
James Hetfield
We're gonna sit here and protest with you until free downloadin' stop, hyeah!
Field Reporter
Tom, it appears now the musicians' strike is growing! As I'm speaking, more musicians are arriving! It looks like Alanis Morissette, Blink 182, Britney Spears, and dozens of others are going to join MOOP in not playing music. This is a veritable Strikapalooza!
Faith Records. Doves fly across the view. The building is bathed in bright sunlight.
CEO
Guys, we here at Faith Records were very moved by your performance at Christfest. You're one of the most talented Christian rock bands we've ever heard!
Cartman
Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
Butters
[tickled by Cartman's line] Heeheeheeyeah.
Executive 1
[looking at some papers, starts off hesitantly] We just have one question, though. We were looking over some of your lyrics, uh... "I want to walk hand-in-hand with Jesus on a private beach for two./I want him to nibble on my ear and say 'I'm here for you.'" It...it seems you really love Christ.
Cartman
Yes, we sure do.
Executive 1
Eh no but it appears you are actually... in love with Christ. [the boys look at each other confused]
Cartman
[turns the tables] Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
Executive 1
[on the defensive] Well uh of course I do. I mean I just-
Cartman
Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
Executive 1
Uh, we'd just like to make sure the bands we sign are in it for God, and not for the money.
Cartman
I resent that, sir! I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I'm lying may the Lord strike me down right now.
Butters
[slowly moves away] Uhm, oh. [leaves his chair]
Executive 1
That's- all we needed to know. Just, sign here and we'll get your album sold.
Commercial. A partly-cloudy sky is shown.
Announcer
K-tal Records [its logo descends from the sky and drops below the screen] presents the most inspirational Christian rock band in the world! Faith + 1, [The CD cover appears] featuring the very best in good, wholesome Christian music.
Cartman
Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
Announcer
[speaking over Cartman] With great inspirational songs like "I Wasn't Born Again Yesterday,"
Cartman
Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
Cartman
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
Announcer
[a shot of a home library, with fireplace and the CD propped on an end table] The CD is filled with instant classics. Who doesn't remember... [the titles scroll by: "The Body of Christ," "Christ Again," "A Night With the Lord," "Touch Me Jesus," "I Found Jesus (With Someone Else)," "Savior Self," "Christ, What a Day," "Three Times My Savior," "Jesus Touched Me"]
Cartman
The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...

Announcer
["Quantities Limited!!!" cycles on the screen] This album is not available in stores and limited quantities are available, so order now!
Kyle's house, day. Various musical acts, some of them from Chef Aid, have gathered to strike against free music downloads with MOOP, including the Lord of the Underworld!
Stan
I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
Kyle
You guys, we can't give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we're gonna be the biggest band ever!
Lars
Yeah, if we all give in now, people might never stop downloading our music for free!
Kyle
I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. [a vehicle is heard pulling up. It's a U.S. Mail van. The driver steps out and approaches the crowd]
Driver
Certified letter for the rock band MOOP?
Kyle
[steps down to get the letter] That's us! [the driver hands him the letter and leaves. Kyle opens the envelope and reads] "Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies."
Stan
What??
Kyle
"We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha." [stands silently for a moment, then hands the letter to Stan and walks forth a bit] He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
Stan
Is this for real?? This is for real!
Kyle
He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
Lars
But why play if we're not gonna make millions of dollars.
Kyle
[turns around and addresses the crowd] Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
Stan
[joins Kyle and faces the crowd] Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. [shots of Rick James, Ozzy, Britney and two other acts.]
Kyle
From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! [grins, but gets no response]
Britney
...We're just about the money.
Other acts
Yeah, yeah.
Kyle
[casts his eyes down] Oh.
Stan
So... Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman. Are you- gonna pay 'em?
Kyle
I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say "Congratulations. You were right" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
Platinum album award ceremony, South Park, next day. Cartman has spent plenty of money to make this possible. He brings forth a parade complete with elephants, clowns, jugglers, a marching band, carnival rides, the works. Cartman stands on stage with Token and Butters before a curtain with a large image of his album cover printed on it.
Cartman
Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
Token
Cartman, what the hell is all this?
Cartman
Our platinum album ceremony. I spared no expense.
Token
But you spent all the money we made!
Cartman
We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole. [addresses the milling crowd] There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone! [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive and join Cartman onstage] Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
Kyle
Let's just get this over with, Cartman. You won the bet, here's ten dollars.
Cartman
[deferring] Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on. [grabs the mic and addresses the crowd] Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? [the crowd cheers wildly]
A Fan
We like to praise Christ!
Cartman
Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. [Kyle is awfully pissed. A technician lowers a lever and stage lights bathe the boys]
Announcer
[a power chord is played, with angelic accompaniment added] Welcome to the presentation ceremony for Faith Plus One. [the crowd cheers] And now to present the award, here's Michael Collins. [he walks up with a plaque]
Kyle
This is the worst day of my life.
Cartman
Ahhh, this is the best day of my life. [basks in the moment]
Michael Collins
Boys, in recognition for over one million records sold, the Christian Recording Industry is please to present you with this Myrrh album. [presents the album plaque to Cartman. The crowd cheers]
Cartman
[takes the album] Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?
Stan
I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
Michael Collins
Nono, in Christian rock, our albums go gold and frankincense and myrrh. Congratulations!
Kyle
Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don't owe you anything, fat boy!
Cartman
You mean to tell me I could never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!
Michael Collins
No, but you can go double myrrh. [Kyle walks off and Cartman gets pissed]
Cartman
GOD DAMMIT!! [throws his plaque onto the ground, where it shatters. The myrrh album falls away and the crowd is stunned]
Michael Collins
[tries to calm Cartman down] Oh, please don't take the Lord's Name in vain.
Cartman
Who cares?! I can never win my bet because you stupid assholes don't give out platinum albums!
Michael Collins
But you spread the Word of the Lord. You've brought faith in Jesus.
Cartman
OH, FUCK JESUS!! [deep gasp from the crowd. A woman screams loudly in disbelief]
Butters
Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
Token
Yeah. You're gonna hurt the band.
Cartman
[pounces onto him] Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! [The crowd screams in disbelief and scatters about]
A Man
My ears are bleeding!
Token
Good job, dickhead! You lost the entire audience!
Cartman
Ah, fuck you, Token! You black asshole!
Token has had enough of that. He smacks Cartman with a left fist, a right fist, and a kick to the head. Cartman is laid out on his back and Token walks away. Cartman rises, but ends up on all fours coughing. A shot of Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. They turn to leave.
Stan
Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.
They walk away, leaving Butters. Cartman is still coughing and Butters is unsure what to do. He rubs his fists past each other tentatively. Then he farts on Cartman's head and flips him off.
Butters
Fuck you, Eric. [He walks away.]
End of Christian Rock Hard

Grey Dawn
South Park Farmer's Market, Day. A crowd is gathered under this banner and listens to Father Maxi as he delivers a service.
Father Maxi
Friends, we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterday's tragedy: nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver. [the four boys are shown in their funeral best]
Cartman
[yawns] Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
Kyle
[jabs Cartman and says in hushed tones] You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!
Cartman
Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
Father Maxi
It is sometimes hard, in times like these, to understand God's way. Why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who, perhaps, shouldn't be driving? It is then that we must understand, God's sense of humor is very different from our own. He does not laugh at the simple "man walks into a bar" joke. No, God needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me. All that we can hope for is that God got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again. [screeching tires are heard]
Mr. Garrison
[rushing into the crowd] Look out!! [everyone turns to see. An elderly driver approaches them]
Elderly Driver
[somewhat short, nearsighted] Huh? Was that a stop sign back there? [the banner recedes behind him. Everyone screams and the driver begins mowing people down. He crashes into a light standard at the other end of the market] Ooooh, I think I hit a pothole.
Stan's house, night. The family is eating dinner.
Stan
Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
Randy
Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.
Stan
But they kill people.
Randy
Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.
Marvin
[enters in his motorized wheelchair] I'll be Goddamned if they think they can take my license away! [stops at his place at table]
Sharon
Oooh, Hi Dad.
Marvin
[to Randy] I heard what you said! You wanna take drivin' privileges away from seniors! Well let me tell you something, peckerface! I worked fifty five years in the steel mill!
Randy
Yes Dad.
Marvin
And I flew Spitfires over Germany in World War II!
Randy
Yes I know.
Marvin
And I will be God-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive!
Stan
I think old people should have rights, Grandpa. I just don't wanna die.
Stark's Pond, night. A lone man is fishing in the middle of the pond. He senses something ominous and looks around. On the road nearby, a brown Buick drives by slowly. A short old woman is at the wheel.
Elderly Man
Damnit Mona, this isn't the fastest way to Country Kitchen Buffet!
Mona
No, but it's the shortest. I save the most gas that way. [back at the pond the fisherman casts his line and looks back at the car]
Elderly Man
You save the most gas if you take the highway to Country Kitchen Buffet!
Mona
Less miles means less gas, you old fool. [back at the pond the fisherman catches something and is reeling it in, but looks at the car in doing so]
Elderly Man
There's Country Kitchen right there!
Mona
Where?
Elderly Man
Right there! You're gonna miss it! [the woman steps hard on the brake and spins the car out of control. The fisherman is about to put his catch into his little boat. The car smashes through the guard rail over a bridge and lands directly on the fisherman, killing him.]
Mona
Is this the parking lot?
Elderly Man
I think so.

Anchor
Another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist. Carl Zorn of Pine Junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by Pete and Lydia Malman, who were trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. This latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in Deer Creek, where three construction workers and a bulldozer [shown] were run down by senior citizen Paul Thom [shown, irate], who was trying to find Country Kitchen Buffet. Public outcry is forcing the DMV to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy, though no decision has yet to be made.
Park County Community Center, day. The seniors have gathered there for a meeting.
Marvin
Seniors of South Park, I don't know about you, but I am mad as hell!
Seniors
[randomly] Yeah!
Elderly Woman 1
[rises] I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
Elderly Man 1
[waving his cane] We need to let everyone know we're pissed off, and we're not gonna take it anymore!
Seniors
[randomly] Yeah! Yeah! That's right, Pete!
Marvin
That's right! Now, ...can anybody remember what we're pissed off about? [everyone seems to have lost a clue] Now, remember we're all pissed about something and uh... that's why we had this meeting, but I... can't for the life of me re-
Elderly Woman 2
[rises] Oooo. Was it the kids skateboarding on the sidewalks? No? [sits down]
Elderly Man 2
[seated behind a walker] Oh, I remember! They're gonna take our licenses away!
Seniors
[randomly, suddenly animated] Yeah! Yeah! That's right!
Marvin
That's right! They're gonna try and take our licenses away! And I, for one, am mad as hell!
Seniors
[randomly] Me too! Yeah, that's right! And mine too!
Elderly Woman 1
I'm sick of having my mental condition come into question!
Marvin
So now, what are we gonna do about it?
Elderly Man 3
Do about what?
Elderly Woman 3
They're gonna take our licenses away.
Elderly Woman 1
They are?? They can't do that! [brief argument ensues]
Marvin
That's right. So you know what I think we should do? I think we should have a senior citizens' meeting! Get all the seniors together at the community center and unite!
Elderly Man 3
Great idea, Marvin!
Elderly Woman 4
Wait, ah I think we're having that meeting right now.
Marvin
...Oh, right, this is the meeting.
Elderly Man 4
Right. To get those damn kids to stop skateboarding on the sidewalks!
Seniors
[randomly] Yeah! Yeah! That's right! Someone's gotta stop them!
The Marsh house, day. Sharon and Shelly are making construction paper cutouts in the kitchen. Shelly has finished some eyes.
Randy
[steps into the kitchen] Sharon, have you seen Dad?
Sharon
He's not here, hon. He's having a meeting with all the seniors in town at the community center.
Randy
Oh. [steps back out] Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...
Sharon
Every senior in town will be driving home...
Randy
[with rising alarm] At the same time. [closeup] Oh My God!
Downtown South Park. People are milling around. Randy runs into the scene.
Randy
Get inside! Get inside! [people begin taking heed] Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! [everyone moves off the streets in panic]
Someone
Oh my Goddd!
Park County Community Center, day. The seniors exit the center and head for their cars.
Marvin
[amid the crowd] All right, great meeting everyone. Let's do it again sometime.
Elderly Woman 1
So long, everybody.
Elderly Man 5
Goodbye, Missy. [other seniors say their goodbyes. They drive off slowly, some bumping into other cars on their way out]
Downtown South Park, at the farmer's market. Randy runs in.
Randy
Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving! [everyone runs off in a panic. Randy finds Gerald and grabs him] Gerald! Where are the boys?!
Gerald
We've gotta get out of here!
Randy
The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!
Gerald
They, they're... they're playing street hockey!
Randy
[closeup] Oh My God!! [lets Gerald go and runs off]
The neighborhood. Stan and the boys are playing street hockey. Cartman is the goalie, a trashcan his goal.
Cartman
[providing his own play-by-play] With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again [the ball bounces off Cartman's girth], proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
Kyle
It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
Cartman
I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
Randy
[in the distance] GET OFF THE STREETS! [Cartman perks up a bit] GET OFF THE STREETS! [the other boys listen, then turn to face the source of the sound]
Kyle
Dude, look!
Randy
[running across empty fields] GET OFF... THE STREETS! GET OFF THE STREETS!
Stan
What is that?
Kyle
I don't know.
Randy
[coming closer] GET OFF... GET OFF THE STREET!
Kyle
Dude, is that your dad?
Stan
I think so.
Cartman
Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
Randy
-STREETS!! OFF-
Stan
What is he saying?
Kyle
I can't understand him.
Randy
GAAAAAH!!
Cartman
[slowly] Calm down! We cannot understand you!
Kenny
[Looks to his right] (Ohhhhh, look!) [a phalanx of slow-moving cars cruises down the street towards them] (You guys!)
Stan
Oh! [drops his hockey stick and holds his hands to his face]
Cartman
Old people!
Randy
[scoops them up and away] Come on! [the cars get closer, Randy and the boys head for a an abandoned lodge]
Cartman
Oh God, they're coming! [the other boys mutter other things]
The Lodge. The group enters, Randy shuts and blocks the doors.
Randy
Get over there! Stay low! [the boys go to the far wall and turn around]
Kyle
Why are they all out driving at the same time?
Randy
Shhhh! [lowers the blinds, closed them, and peeks out. Seeing nothing, he closes the blinds and sighs in relief] It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find- [a blue car crashes through the large picture window the blinds were covering and stops. Randy jumps in alarm] AWWWW!!
Elderly Driver
[a man] I don't remember there being a building here.
Randy
RUN! [they all gather at a corner, but another car crashes through the wall]
Elderly Passenger
[a woman] I told you to turn left, Larry.
Randy
Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! [he and the boys run up the stairs]
Kyle
Aah! There's another one!
Randy and the Boys
AAAHH!!
Elderly Driver
[follows them up the stair in her car] Excuse me, is this Costello Avenue? [Randy and the boys reach the second floor]
Randy
In here! [Randy opens a door and a bloody body drops down, dangling by its feet. They move on to the next room and close the door]
Cartman
They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
Randy
Quiet! Keep quiet! [a few seconds of silence pass]
Stan
Dad, I'm scared.
Randy
Just, keep your voices down. We'll stay the night in here. We'll stay the whole winter if we have to. [looks for a light switch to flip on]
Stan
I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
Randy
Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. [finds the switch and flips them on, revealing a car]
Elderly Driver
How the hell did we get up here?
Randy and the Boys
AAAAAAAHH!! [quickly exit the room]
Elderly Passenger
I told you this was the wrong way!
News 4. A splash screen shows various correspondents and anchors, and a globe spins in front of the montage.
Field Reporter
Tom, I'm standing outside of the Department of Motor Vehicles, where senior citizens have until three p.m. to hand over their driver's licenses. The new law was passed just three days after the Night of Horror, in which all seniors were out driving at the same time, causing fourteen deaths and three million dollars in damage.
DMV, inside. A poster on the wall says "Drive 65 MPH. Stay alive." Two men and a woman sit at a table taking the licenses seniors standing in line give them.
DMV Official
[seated in the middle, takes a license from an elderly man] Alrighty. [cuts it in two and drops the halves into a box] There we go. Next? [a fat elderly lady approaches, then the elderly man with the walker]
Elderly Man 2
It ain't right what you're doin'! I never had an accident in my life!
Elderly Woman 6
That's right. You shouldn't punish all of us. [the senior with the walker leaves the table]
DMV Official
We're sorry, but this is the only way to be sure. Next please. [cuts up another license] There we go.
Elderly Man 6
But how am I supposed to get to the grocery store? Or the pharmacy to buy medicine?
DMV Official
Well, maybe you should be in a nursing home. Hmmm?
Elderly Man 7
Some of us would rather die!
DMV Official
Well, we can certainly help you with that, too.
Elderly Woman 7
We aren't second-class citizens!
Elderly Man 8
That's right! You can take our licenses, but you'll never take our pride!
An Elderly Man
Yeah...
Stan's house, day. The boys leave the house.
Cartman
Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
Marvin
Billy, get in the car! I need you boys to help me pick up my new Hov-Around.
Stan
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
Marvin
God-damnit Billy! You're supposed to listen to your dad, right?! Well I'm your dad's dad, and that means you get in this car before I tan all your hides!
Kyle
[to the other boys] Well, look at it this way: statistically speaking, we're safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside.
Cartman
My God, he's right. [the boys climb in, strap themselves in, and Cartman offers a quick prayer] Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death. [Marvin starts up the car and groans a bit] Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys. [a few moments later] Except for you, Kyle.
Marvin
Okay, all set? [he backs out of the a driveway, and an oncoming car honks at him. The driver screams something at him. Pretty soon, other cars and trucks are doing their best to avoid him. Cars begin crashing and flying through the air. The boys wince at every accident]
Kenny
(Oooooo my God!) [a police cruiser catches up to them]
Stan
Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
Marvin
Eh? [signals to the officer] Go around. Go around, you moron!
Barbrady
Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over!
Cartman
I believe that's us... thank God. [Marvin pulls over to the side and stops. Barbrady stops as well and approaches the driver side.]
Barbrady
Could I see your license, please?
Marvin
I ain't got one! You peckers took it!
Barbrady
Well then, I have to take you to jail.
Marvin
You just try taking me to jail, scrotum-head! You just try!
The police jail. Marvin sits behind bars with a cane.
Marvin
Stupid son of a- God damnit!
Barbrady
I just got him right here, Mr. Marsh.
Randy
Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!
Marvin
Oh God damnit, don't you lecture me you son of a bitch!
Randy
You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!
Marvin
Now my son is gonna talk to me like I'm twelve.
Randy
We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm? [wags his left index finger at Marvin] Who's the sorry-sorry?
Marvin
Kiss my sagging ass!
Randy
Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!
Marvin
Well I won't be sitting here long! I've already called the AARP!
Stan
What's that?
Marvin
The American Association of Retired Persons! The largest political group in the country! When seniors like me are bein' discriminated against, the AARP comes and sets it right! [points to Randy] And you're gonna be sorry when they get here!
Mr. garrison's Classroom, day. He is giving a history lesson to the class.
Mr. Garrison
And so you see, children, Genghis Khan was a "Mongol," not to be confused with a "mongoloid" like the actor, Nicholas Cage. Okay now, who can tell me in what [notices something outside and goes to the window, his voice fading off] the ...first ...film by a... mongoloid...
Mr. Garrison
[What he sees is elderly paratroopers drifting down onto the school grounds. The kids' eyes follow him and then the kids gather at the window with him] That's odd. [the AARP has landed] Those ROTC guys are way off course. [the paratroopers open their cargo boxes and unload some firearms]
Cartman
More old people!
Stan
The American Association of Retired Persons.
Mr. Garrison
Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.
AARP leader
Set up a perimeter! Bring Bravo Team to Point Delta!
AARP member 1
[a heavyset woman] Bravo Team is go.
AARP member 2
[a light-skinned black man] Move! Move! Move!
AARP member 3
[a woman in purple dress] Let's go! Let's go! [Mr. Garrison comes out to meet them.]
Mr. Garrison
Uh, can I help you folks find something? [the woman smacks him across the face with the butt of her semi-automatic.] Oowww! [goes down in pain on one knee. The seniors begin firing away, with rifles, semi-automatics, whatever. The kids look on and gasp]
Cartman
Old people gone mad!
U.S. Geological Service. Randy sits at his desk making notes when he hears the soft rustling of tarp on snow. He spins around in his chair to see more AARP paratroopers. He rises in disbelief. A gas canister flies through the window and unleashes its fumes. Randy starts coughing. The door flies open and some AARP paratroopers walk in wearing gas masks.

[woman wearing a flower-design dress] Contact. [quickly aims her machine gun at Randy] Put your hands up, young man!
South Park Jail. Marvin is looking out his small cell window when the AARP enters the jail and approach the cell.
AARP leader
Marvin Marsh?
Marvin
[turns around] Yes?
AARP leader
I'm Bill Stewart, President of the AARP. Hu-we've come to help the seniors in this town fight back.
Marvin
Oh, it's nice to meet ya, Bill.
Stewart
Huh?? We came as fast as we could. We just had to stop by Country Kitchen Buffet first.
Shady Acres, a Retirement Community. The AARP has arrived.
AARP leader
[a black man] It's the nursing home! Liberate our comrades!
Shady Acres, inside
Male Nurse
There now, Mr. Johnson. [wheels a senior across the room] We can go to the cafeteria and get you some creamed corn and toast. [the front doors swing open and the nurse stops in his tracks. The AARP members swarm in] Can I help you?
AARP leader
Help this! [jams the butt of his gun into the nurse, and the nurse falls.] The revolution is on, brother! [hands Mr. Johnson a semi-automatic] We're taking control of the town!
Mr. Johnson
Well, alright, well it's about damn time! [addresses the nursing home residents] Hey everyone, we're taking the town. [other seniors look at him and express their approval]
The television room. More seniors there are watching TV.
AARP member
[enters with the black leader] Seniors, we're taking the town over.
AARP leader
The revolution is on! [walks away]
Elderly Woman
The revolution?
Elderly Man
Oh, I'd better get my other sweater. [goes to change while the others leave the room]
A convalescent room.
A Nurse
[distributing weapons] Mrs. Wyland, seniors are taking over the town. Would you like a gun?
Mrs. Wyland
Oh, I suppose so.
Downtown South Park, day. One of the members brings Randy forward.
Randy
What the hell is going on?!
AARP member
Shut your piehole and get over there! [Randy joins Gerald and other adult hostages]
Gerald
Randy, what is this?
Stewart
Hey! You are now under the authority of the AARP!
Marvin
Ha! There you go, Mr. Smartmouth! Look at you now!
Randy
Dad, what are you doing??
Marvin
The AARP is gonna help us take this town until we get our licenses back!
Elderly Woman
[in dark-blue dress] Yeah, and we're gonna ask for more money in Medi-Care, too!
AARP leader
[black] That's right.
Elderly Man
Yeah.
Man in Vest
[handcuffed in front] Have you all got Alzheimer's? The-they're not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked out senior citizens.
Stewart
[puts hand to ear] Heh?? [lowers his hand] We'll tell them if they don't give us our demands, we'll start killin' hostages!
Man in Vest
Huh, right. They're gonna really believe that. [the elderly woman next to him simply lifts her gun and fires at the man point blank. The man falls down dead]
Marvin
Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?
Stewart
[puts hand to ear] Heh?? [lowers his hand] No, we gotta be tough! Just like with those damned Japs!
Randy
This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!
Marvin
The time when you can tell me what to do is over, pucky-boy! We're in charge now!
South Park, day. The town is now an encampment, protected by barbed wire, sandbags, and metal shields. A woman with an IV unit stands behind some sandbags.
Marvin
All right, we've got control of the Mayor's office and the fire station.
AARP member
Reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in Conifer.
Stewart
Good! Hell, us senior citizens could take over the entire country!
AARP lookout
[a black woman] We've got company! [the military arrives]
Tank Driver
[over a PA system] Attention seniors: lay down your weapons and turns yourselves over!
Stewart
Mrs. Applegate, show 'em we mean business.
Mrs. Applegate
[holding an RPG launcher] All right. [fires the rocket and falls back from the recoil. The rocket heads for a Jeep full of troops. The troops scramble off. The rocket strikes and demolishes the Jeep, killing one of the soldiers]
Tank Driver
What do you want?
Stewart
[puts hand to ear] Heh??
Marvin
We want our licenses back!
Other Seniors
Yeah!
Elderly Woman
That's right. And we want more money in Medi-Care!
Other Seniors
Yeah!
Elderly Man
And we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin' on the sidewalk!
Other Seniors
Yeah!
Nighttime, the drive-in. All adults who are not senior citizens have been gathered into an enclosure around the massive screen. Two seniors stand guard at the gates, other seniors keep the adults in line. The adults are cold. Some cough, some try to keep warm by burning tires inside empty gas drums. Randy is one of those warming his hands over a fire. He moans. The boys arrive, having not been arrested.
Stan
Hey Dad.
Randy
[runs to the fence] Stan! Boys! You're safe!
Stan
Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
Randy
They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
Kyle
They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
Randy
[exasperated] Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
Stan
No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
Randy
No, son. We... like to sleep in.
An Elderly Woman
Two hostages come front and center! [Randy looks back, alarmed].
Randy
They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!! [the boys turn and leave] Boys, avenger me! AVENGE ME!!
The woods. The boys have set up a little camp there for the night.
Stan
All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here [south entrance] and here [west entrance]. The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
Cartman
So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
Kyle
We can't fight them, Cartman.
Cartman
No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply. [runs his finger along the map to its destination] Here.
Kyle
Country Kitchen Buffet?
Cartman
Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
Kyle
That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
Cartman
Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
Stan
Yeah, I remember hearing about that.
Kyle
Even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
Cartman
I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.
Cartman
We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people. [they appear from the sides of buildings dressed in black and then gather in front of one of them] At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town. [they head for a train at the South Park Train Station and climb into a caboose. Kenny pulls on the horn] Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office[the elderly guards sleep standing up and fail to take notice of any sound] and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed.
Cartman
Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside.
Cartman does all the strapping, and he brings out a remote-control trigger as Kyle approaches the restaurant's front door. He presses the button and the buffet blows up. Kyle's charred hat drops back in front of the boys. The boys cheer.
Cartman
Yeah!
Stan
All right!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Cartman
Aw yeah!
Stan
We did it! [Cartman is finished and the others look at him like he's crazy]
Stan
...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
Cartman
Well, right, or we could always do that.
South Park, day. The old people have the run of the town, and they're bringing in heavier artillery.
Stewart
All right everyone, round up your ammunition and get ready to move! We're takin' this war further out!
AARP Members
[amid other cheers] All right!
Marvin
Uh, I appreciate what the AARP is tryin' to do for us, but uh, all we want is our licenses back.
Stewart
[puts hand to ear] Huh?? [lowers his hand] Heck no! This is goin' too well.We're gonna take the whole country back. Wipe out everyone below the age of sixty five!
Marvin
Wipe 'em out?? What are you? Senile?
Stewart
[approaches the front door of Country Kitchen Buffet] Come on, everyone! It's time to plan for Phase 2! [tries to get the doors open, but finds they're locked. He scratches his head] What the heck? [checks again, but the doors remain locked] Huh? What is this?! It's 6 a.m. C-Country Kitchen should be open!
Elderly Man 9
It's not open? It has to be! [each man takes a door and tries to open it, but the doors won't budge]
Elderly Man 10
Try a window.
Elderly Man 11
[bangs on a window, to no avail] They're blocked from the inside.
Stewart
No... [bangs frantically on the double doors] Let us in! Let us in!
Elderly Man 9
Open the door! It's six a.m. [the other seniors come up and bang on the windows]
Elderly Woman
Open the Country Kitchen Buffet for us!
Elderly Man
You have to let us in! [a few hours later and all the seniors are sprawled out on the snow. One of them is still trying to crawl. A few more hours and all movement has stopped]
Army Official
All right everyone, area secure. Collect their weapons and free the hostages. [walks up to the boys] That was a great strategy, boys. You may very well have saved this entire country. [Randy and Sharon arrive rubbing their eyes. Gerald and Sheila arrive also]
Randy
Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?
Army Official
Everything is fine. Control of the town is back to you folks.
Stewart
[two soldiers escort his fatigued self away] Country Kitchen... wha-what happened?
Soldier
[one of two escorting Marvin] Sir, what should we do with this one?
Army Official
It's up to the townspeople.
Randy
Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
Stan
Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
Randy
Huh?
Stan
Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
Marvin
That's right.
Stan
And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
Marvin
I know. I guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we don't put the responsibility on our families.
Randy
Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.
Marvin
Sure. I'll drive.
Randy
[laughs and goes to wheel Marvin off] That's our Grandpa. [both men and Sharon laugh]
Stan
[to his friends] Dude, I hate my family. [looks down embarrassed and walks away]
End of Grey Dawn

Casa Bonita
Stan's house, day. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman watch TV from the couch. Cartman is eating a bowl of chips.
Stan
Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.
Cartman
Maybe he caught a disease and died. That'd be so awesome.
Stan
Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Cartman
Who's joking? [a door opens and closes offscreen]
Kyle
[enters excitedly, his arms up in the air] You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
Cartman
You have AIDS?
Kyle
No. This Saturday, for my birthday, my Mom says she's takin' me to Casa Bonita, in Denver, and I get to invite three friends!
Cartman
[stands up] Wow! Casa Bonita?!
Kenny
[stands up] (Woo-hoo!)
Stan
[stands up] What's Casa Bonita?
Cartman
Dude, haven't you ever been there?! It's a big Mexican restaurant where they have, like, cliff jumpers and Black Bart's Cave and [holds out his hand wide] all kinds of stuff!
Kyle
It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
Cartman
This Saturday! Awesome! [begins to sing to "La Cucaracha"] Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita! Food and fun in a festive atmosphere. [begins to snap his fingers] Casa Bonita!
Kyle
Who said I'm inviting you? [this freezes Cartman for a few seconds]
Cartman
You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
Kyle
Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
Cartman
Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
Kyle
I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
Cartman
Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
Kyle
Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
Cartman
I have never been a dick to you.
Kyle
[rolls his eyes] Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
Cartman
Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
Kyle
[thinks back and counts the number of times Cartman has ripped on him for being a Jew]
[in the playground. Craig is there instead of Kenny] Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew!
[in the playground, by the school's back doors] You're a Jew!
[in Cartman's room. Cartman is wearing a crown] Shut your God-damned Jew mouth!
[at Kyle's house, on the front steps] Good job, Jew!
[singing the Dreidel song with Kyle's family and Stan] Jew...
[leaving his seat in class] Shut up, Jew!
[at Cartman's house, with outfits] You're Jewish!!
[seated on a curb with the other boys] Dude, he's Jewish!
[staking out a house] Jew!
[on Nightline, seated next to Stan] Jew!
[in Cartman's dining room] Jew!
[at the side of a road, with Tweek and with their parents] Jew!
[next to stacks of lumber, as Kyle is about to whack him] Jew!
[at a barn, through a hole on the roof] Jew!
[Stan's room. Kyle reads a Bible] Jew?!
[At the Costa Rican rainforest, during practice] "I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm." "Fuck off, Cartman!"
Cartman
[Cartman thinks back as well] Okay, except maybe for that one time.
Kyle
You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. [turns and walks away, but Cartman stays close]
Cartman
Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place [Kyle turns around] in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! [holds his hands together in a sign of pleading]
Kyle
[crosses his arms and avoids Cartman's eyes] Sorry, my mind's made up.
Cartman
[turns irate and flips him off] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day! [shoves the middle finger close to Kyle's face] Kiss my balls, asshole!!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, closes, and opens again. Cartman returns and apologizes] Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle. I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
Kyle:
[clearly annoyed now] I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
Cartman
[turns irate and flips him off again] Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! [turns and walks away. The front door opens, then closes]
Cartman's house, night. Cartman sleeps...
Cartman
Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys! [waves them on. Next scene is him getting a large platter of food] Oh, awesome!! [next scene is him waving his friends to a cave] Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave! [next scene is him by a waterfall] Wow, cliff divers! [a cliff diver takes a dive from the top of the waterfall. Next scene is Cartman on his third dish] More sopapillas, please! [next scene has him dancing in front of a low stage, on which a mariachi quartet plays its songs. An image of Kyle floats through his dream]
Kyle
I'm not inviting you, Cartman. You can't go.
Cartman
[with more foods on his plates, the dream dissolves. He's pulled up and away] No! Noooo! [he's pulled out of Casa Bonita and floats away] Casa Bonita! Noooo! [startled out of his dream] AAAAH!! [catches his breath] Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
Kyle's house, next day. Cartman approaches the front door in a nice sweater and rings the bell. Kyle answers.
Cartman
[looking quite presentable] Hi Kyle. [smiles]
Kyle
[studies Cartman a bit, but isn't impressed] That isn't it, Cartman.
Cartman
What isn't it?
Kyle
That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
Cartman
...I don't understand the difference.
Kyle
I know you don't. [steps back and slams the door on Cartman's face]
South Park Elementary, day. The kids head for class: Bill, Craig, Wendy, then Jimmy. Cartman enters and rounds the corner, sees Jimmy and runs up to him.
Cartman
Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up! [Annie and Red walk by at the far end of the hall. Jimmy stops] Dude, uh I need your help on something.
Jimmy
Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-problem?
Cartman
Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how "do" you act nice to people?
Jimmy
Well, the best thing is not to act nice, Eric. Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.
Cartman
Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
Jimmy
Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
Cartman
Like what?
Jimmy
Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.
Cartman
Who's there?
Jimmy
Ing-mar ...Bergman. [Cartman jumps, but not because of the joke. Kyle approaches them from the other end of the hall.] Now you say, "Ingmar Bergman who?" [Cartman quickly punches Jimmy in the face]
Cartman
Take that, Jimmy! [strikes him again, and Jimmy falls away] And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again! [Kyle stops by and looks. Cartman glances at him] Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?! [looks at Kyle] Oh, Kyle. Hey.
Kyle
Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? [turns and walks on his way]
Cartman
Uh... [turns and runs towards Kyle] He-hey Kyle! Knock knock. [follows him around the corner] Knock knock, Kyle!
The school cafeteria. Cartman is looking at a picture. A tear wells up in his left eye. The picture's frame reads "I Had A Good Time at CASA BONITA," and the picture within is one of Cartman, his mom, and the mariachis in the background. He hears Kyle's excited voice.
Kyle
Yeah, Casa Bonita, this Saturday! [approaches a table with Kenny, Stan, and Butters]
Butters
Wow, that's gonna be so fun!
Stan
Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
Kenny
(Yeah!) [Cartman sits at his own table, alone.]
The school hall, the bell rings. Red and Annie walk one way, Kyle and Craig the opposite way. Keven opens up his locker. Kyle stops at his locker, and Cartman walks up.
Cartman
Hey Kyle.
Kyle
Well?
Cartman
Well what?
Kyle
How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
Cartman
I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
Kyle
Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
Cartman
So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
Kyle
I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
Cartman
I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. [turns and walks away]
Kyle
Eh... hey, Cartman? [Cartman turns around] You really don't care that you can't go?
Cartman
I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
Kyle
That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
Cartman
Good.
Kyle
And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
Cartman
Sweet, whatever. [walks on, then mouths to himself] Bingo!
Cartman's house, Friday night. Cartman leads Butters into his bedroom.
Butters
What's this all about, Eric?
Cartman
[leads him to a telescope, then turns] Butters, can you keep a secret?
Butters
Well, sure I can!
Cartman
For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
Butters
Nnn-how terrible?
Cartman
A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
Butters
What?? [begins rubbing his hands together nervously]
Cartman
Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think. [backs up and looks through the eyepiece] Do you see anything?
Butters
I just see stars. [Cartman hops onto a chair and fishes in his left jacket pocket. He pulls out a wad of junk hanging from a string]
Cartman
Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
Butters
Nope, uh I don't see any... [Cartman holds up the wad against the objective lens] Oh wait. Oh my God! I see it. I see it! It's a meteor! Oh my God!
Cartman
Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? [Butters looks through again and Cartman holds up the wad, moving it closer to the objective lens.]
Butters
It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
Cartman
Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
Butters
When do you think uh it'll get here?
Cartman
I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations. [heads for his desk and pulls out a calculator] 10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
Butters
What??
Cartman
According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
Butters
Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!
Cartman
No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
Butters
Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
Cartman
Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! [heads out the door]
Butters
AAAAHH! [follows him out]
Jimbo's house. Cartman and Butters head for the bomb shelter.
Butters
Oh Jeez!
Cartman
Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! [opens the shelter's lid]
Butters
[enters and climbs down the ladder within] Oh God! Oh Jesus! [Cartman watches him, then follows him down the ladder]
Cartman
[reaches the shelter floor] All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
Butters
But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
Cartman
No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
Butters
Are you sure?
Cartman
[looks away] I'm not sure of anything anymore. [turns and climbs up the ladder. He makes it out and looks down] Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
Butters
But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
Cartman
Well, you know, with your wiener. [Butters just stares back] Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. [leaves and closes the lid, then locks it]
Butters
[in darkness] Oh God, oh God!
Kyle's house, Saturday night. Stan and Kenny are dressed in stripes, Sheila waits in a fur coat, Kyle is in his Sunday best checking his watch.
Kyle
Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
Sheila
Well I think we better just go without him, Kyle. It's getting late.
Kyle
Yeah, screw him. Let's go. [the door bell rings and Kyle looks at the door] Oh, finally! [walks to get the door, but sees Cartman instead]
Cartman
[bearing a gift] Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
Kyle
Oh. Thanks, dude.
Cartman
Hope you have a good one. See you later. [turns around and walks toward the street]
Kyle
Oh wait. Cartman.
Cartman
Yes?
Kyle
Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
Cartman
[enters the house] Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
Kyle
I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
Cartman
Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
Kyle
All right, let's go.
Sheila
[heads for the front door] Okay, boys. Get in the car.
Cartman
[gets excited] Casa Bonita, here we come! Casa Bonita! Casa Bonita!
Sheila
[finds Butters' parents approaching] Oh, hello Chris, Linda.
Chris
[misty-eyed. Linda sobs silently] Hello everyone. Have any of you seen our son?
Kyle
Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
Chris
We know, but... he hasn't been home since last night. The police have been looking everywhere, but... [Linda cries audibly] Well, thank you. Uh, please, let us know if you find out anything. [they leave. Linda is sobbing hard]
Linda
Oh Butters!
Kyle
Aw dude, weak.
Cartman
[lowers his head and walks towards the front door] Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters. [brightens up] Well, let's get going, shall we?
Kyle
Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
Stan
Yeah, it's kinda weird.
Cartman
[a little stunned] Ee-yeah yeah. I think you're right, but, on the other hand, I think Butters would want us to go. You know Butters...
Kyle
Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
Stan
Yeah.
Sheila
That's very good of you, boys. We can postpone Casa Bonita until next Saturday.
Cartman
Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the... [catches himself and waits for a reaction. None comes] In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
Stan
Dude, we should check over at Stark's Pond. Butters always hangs out over there. [exits]
Kyle
Yeah. And then we can try the football field. [exits]
Sheila
I'll drive you boys. [exits]
Cartman
[left alone] Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
South Park, Sunday. In front of the police station, Officer Barbrady stands by while one of his men issues the report to the crowd standing before the dais.
Captain
All right, folks, this is the little boy we're looking for: [holds up a picture of Butters] Leopold Stotch, also known as Butters. He's been missing for two days and was last seen at the school. Let's go find him.
The bomb shelter. Butters has found the light switch and is enjoying the rations stored on the shelves along the wall.
Butters
[reading some directions] "Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square..." [the lid opens up above him] Hello? [rises and looks up] Hello??
Cartman
[suddenly looks in, looking terribly roughed up] Butters!
Butters
[jumps back, startled] Hwaaaah!!
Cartman
Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
Butters
Wuh, wait, well, what happened??
Cartman
[faking fatigue] The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
Butters
What about my parents. Did you see them?
Cartman
There was mass confusion! Pa... panic! People were crawling all over each other in the streets! It was... awful! When it hit, millions were evaporated instantly. The rest of us... walking around in a... cloud of... toxic... radiation. [coughs]
Butters
[heads for the ladder and begins to climb] Oh my God, let me see!
Cartman
No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
Butters
[off the ladder] How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
Cartman
We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. [strains a bit, like he's gonna cough]
Butters
Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
Cartman
Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild. [coughs] I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday. [moves off] G-goodbye! [locks the lid down once again] All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
Police station, night. News 4 is covering another announcement by the police.
Field Reporter
Tom, it has now been three days since the Stotch child has gone missing. Townspeople continue to search, but hope... is dwindling.
Captain
All right, folks. I wanna thank you for all your efforts. Three days is a long time, but we've got to keep going if we're gonna find him.
Cartman
[not spoken, he's thinking this while the captain speaks.] Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. [closes his eyes and begins anticipating. Three images come up. The first is of his waitress bringing him food, the second is of him dancing before a mariachi band, the third is of the cliff divers. He begins to dance while he daydream]
Captain
Many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves. It is important that we spread our search to duct pipes, wells, and bomb shelters. [Cartman's dance is rudely interrupted by this]
Cartman
What what what?
Captain
I say we need to move the search to ducts, wells, and bomb shelters. Let's move out, people! Every second counts! [the crowd breaks up and begins the search]
Cartman
UUuuugh!! [runs off]
Butters
But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.
Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,
Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl. [the shelter lid opens again] Eric? [rises and looks up the shaft] Eric, is that you?
Cartman
[scrambling down the ladder] Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
Butters
Who's coming this way?
Cartman
The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
Butters
Oh God! I hate cannibals!
Cartman
They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
Butters
Noooo!
Cartman
We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box! [picks it up and promptly drops it over Butters so Butters can't see a thing.] There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
Butters
But I can't see nothin'.
Cartman
Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. [guides him to the ladder and nudges him up] There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top. [Butters climbs out] Good.
Butters
Are we out in the destruction?
Cartman
Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
Butters
Aw man.
Cartman
All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. [walks off. Butters follows]
An open field, night. Butters and Cartman are walking through the field behind a row of houses, far enough away so that no sound can reach them.
Cartman
Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
Butters
Huh... Oh, it's terrible.
Cartman
We're coming now to the crater where the meteor hit. A hole in the Earth over two miles in diameter.
Butters
Whoa!
The old gas station.
Cartman
Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here. [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back] Oh my God!
Butters
Whaaat??
Cartman
It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! [steps to the other side and begins making noises, then steps back]
Butters
AAAAHH!
Cartman
We've got to fight them off! [jabs at the air a few times] Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope! [makes "cannibal" noises] Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
Butters
Waaaaaah!
Cartman
[picks up a twig] Aw man, he's eating my hand like a piece of chicken! Can you hear the bones crack? [goes to Butters' other side and begins breaking off pieces of the twig as he makes more "cannibal" noises.]
Butters
Ooohhhh!
Cartman
Wait! Look here! There's a dead body with an axe in the back. I'll pull out the axe and use it to chop off the cannibal's head. Hunh! [swings it and kills the "cannibal"] Die! [one last jab, the "cannibal" "croaks" and it's over]
Butters
Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!
Cartman
[feigns exhaustion] The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me, [checks out his hand] which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
Butters
Oh no!
Cartman
We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
Butters
Uh w-where??
Cartman
Look! There's an old refrigerator! [reaches it and opens it] Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
Butters
Aren't you coming?
Cartman
Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change. [begins to "change"] No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
Butters
Eric, you're the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.
Cartman
I love you too, man. I just [goes into spasms] You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! [lunges at Butters, who quickly closes the refrigerator door. Cartman walks up and rips off the door handle, then walks away chuckling to himself. A few seconds later a garbage truck backs up and removes the refrigerator from the gas station]
South Park, next day. Cartman is happily asleep in his bed and his alarm goes off.
Cartman
Hah! [turns off his bear alarm clock, hops out of bed cheerfully and skips to his wall calendar he made just for the occasion.] It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday! [crosses off Tuesday on his calendar] Only three more days till Casa Bonita. I'm gonna go through Black Bart's Cave first. No! I'm gonna watch the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it's my birthday, they'll let me cliff-dive in the pool! [walks off to get dressed] Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
Park County Trash Dump, night. The refrigerator is now there and begins to heave. Butters kicks his way out of it, having run out of air.
Butters
[rises, catches his breath, and dusts himself off] Finally I can breathe a- [looks at the apparent devastation around him] Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left. [walks forth] Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello? [rustling sounds are heard and he tenses up in fear, then softly] Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals. [more loudly] Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am? [he watches, and a dog emerges from the rubble] Oh. Aww, it's a little dog. [approaches the mutt] Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. [walks into the rubble and begins his work]
South Park, day. On the highway, Sheila drives the boys towards their destination. All the boys are now wearing suits instead of sweaters. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sit in the back seat.
Cartman
We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
Stan
Really?
Kyle
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
Cartman
[sniffs] "Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart's Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart's Cave right away 'cause, we're gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we'll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.
Stan
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
Cartman
What? Fuck Kyle. [the others look at him in astonishment] Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
Cartman
Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]
Stan, Cartman, Kenny
Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. [they pass a missing person's billboard with Butters on it and South Park PD's phone number].
Park County Trash Dump, day. A worker drives into the dump in her truck and pulls out stuffed trash bags from the truck bed.
Butters
[off-screen] You take away the biggest part of me. [the worker listens, then goes to the source of the sound] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go. [hums a bit; the worker arrives to see him sweeping] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
Worker
Hello? [her name tag reads "Irene."]
Butters
[quickly arms himself with the broom] HAAAAGH! Who are you? Are you infected?
Worker
With what?
Butters
You're not a cannibal, are you?
Worker
No
Butters
Oh. [drops the broom and smiles] Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
Worker
Kid, what are you doin' here?
Butters
I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look. [moves off to his left, she follows. They pass a row of makeshift buildings that he built overnight] This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this [a statue that reads Cartman under it] is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh? [promptly unzips and drops his pants, then steps forward.] I'm ready whenever you are.
Worker
Kid, I don't know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump.
Butters
Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
Worker
No, I mean you're at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they've been looking for you for over a week.
Butters
[looks at her for a long time, then looks towards the town] Oh... [realizes he's been tricked, he looks down and pulls up his pants.] Ma'am, can I use your phone?
Casa Bonita, night. Sheila pulls into a parking space.
Cartman
We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita! [the boys climb out of the car] Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
Sheila
Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together. [Cartman stops and dances in place. A phone rings] Uh, hold on boys, that's my cell phone. [fishes it out of her purse and answers it] Hello? Yes. Oh, that's great! [to her charges] Boys, they found Butters. [Cartman stops dancing and his grin turns into panic] He's okay.
Kyle
Oh, awesome.
Stan
I knew he'd turn up.
Sheila
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why? [her face turns stern] Oh really? [Cartman looks around for a way to escape]
Kyle
What?
Sheila
Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you. [hangs up and puts the phone away] Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because he wanted to go to Casa Bonita. [the anger now registers on the other boys' faces]
Kyle
What?
Sheila
Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!
Cartman
But... Casa Bonita.
Kyle
[approaches Cartman, who turns around] I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
Cartman
[turns to face Casa Bonita] But I... [turns back] but... [suddenly takes Kyle hostage] Stand back!
Stan
Cartman, stop it!
Cartman
[backs up towards the restaurant with Kyle still hostage] I... am going... to Casa... Bonita! [sirens are heard]
Kyle
It's too late, fatass. [Cartman stops] They'll be here in less than a minute.
Cartman
[hauls Kyle away a bit longer] Ah! Eh. Nuh! [throws him away and dashes for the entrance] Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
Kyle
[rises and turns around] Cartman!
Casa Bonita, inside. Cartman races into the restaurant.
Cartman
Oh, awesome!! [approaches a table which has a family enjoying its dinner] Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your- [grabs some food from both the mother's plate and the father's plate] Thank you. Thank you. [climbs over the table] Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave! [hops off and runs for the cave, barging his way past two other kids] Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave! [runs in] Oh! [stops at a treasure chest with a pirate skeleton beside it] Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton! [moves on] Oh man, I'm so scared! [exits]
Cartman
Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers! [rushes to them, stopping long enough to dance before the mariachi band] Come on! Come on, dive! [atop the waterfall, a cliff diver stands ready] Dive, asshole! [the diver dives into the pool below] Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh? [looks towards the entrance and sees the rest of his party and the police enter the restaurant] Whoa. [dashes for the jail set at the Photo Flash Back. He puts on the suit waiting for the next customer and looks out from behind bars. His picture is taken and he quickly jumps down from the cell. He moves on to the table he dreamt about two weeks ago] Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?! [a waitress arrives with a plate of sopapillas] Sweeet! [runs off with it and heads for a new attraction] Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! [an officer steps in and blocks his way, he tosses his dessert away and turns back]
Kyle
Cartman! [the boys and Sheila trace his path and close in on Cartman. Cartman runs up along the side of the "cliff" until he gets to the top, where two other officers meet him]
Captain
All right, kid! End of the line!
Cartman
[steps left] Ah. [steps right] Uh. [moves around a bit more, then jumps off the cliff] Yeeeesss!
Kyle
Jesus Christ! [Cartman ends up face down in the water, which isn't deep enough to drown him. He flips over and coughs.
Captain
Well kid, you made an entire town panic, you lost all your friends, and now you're going to Juvenile Hall for a week! Huh, was it worth it?
Cartman
Totally. [smiles]
End of Casa Bonita

All About Mormons
South Park Elementary, day. In Mr. Garrison's classroom the kids enter and go for their desks.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, let's take our seats. [a blond boy stands to his left] We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. [Gary looks around. The kids don't say a word]
Gary
Hello everybody. It's really great to meet you all.
Mr. Garrison
Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at each other] He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste.
Gary
I'm really excited to live in this town and share all kinds of great experiences with you, my new friends!
Kyle
[quietly, to Stan] Oh, dude, what a little asshole!
Stan
Yeah, screw that kid!
Mr. Garrison
All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? [Gary goes to the seat to Cartman's right as Cartman looks on with some trepidation. Once Gary is seated, Cartman lurches away from him about six inches]
Gary
[offering a handshake] Hey. My name's Gary.
Cartman
[falsetto] Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.
Gary
[laughs] That's funny. You're cool, man.
Mr. Garrison
Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon? [writes "Moon Landing" on the board]
Gary
[without hesitation] Oh! Oh oh oh! Nineteen sixty nine!
Mr. Garrison
Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? [writes "1969" on the board]
The playground. Gary is kicking a soccer ball around. The other fourth grade boys approach and look. Shown are Craig, Butters, Kyle, Clyde, Stan, Cartman, Token, Kevin, and another boy
Kyle
Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
Cartman
Yeah. Somebody needs to put him in him place!
Butters
He's a peckerface, that's what he is!
Cartman
Go kick his ass, Stan.
Clyde
Yeah, go kick his ass.
Stan
Well, maybe he won't fight.
Cartman
Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
Kyle
Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
Craig
Yeah, little bitch!
Stan
All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. [leaves]
Cartman
Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan! [then, when Stan is gone, softly] All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
Gary
[looks up as Stan approaches] Oh hey there! You wanna kick the ball around with me?
Stan
No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.
Gary
Excuse me?
Stan
I'm gonna kick your ass... [glances back] bitch.
Gary
How come you wanna fight me? ...Oh, I get it. I'm the new kid. [sigh] Yeah, I guess maybe I deserve it.
Stan
[off guard] Huh?
Gary
It's really tough being in a totally new place, but I think all you guys are really cool so... I understand if there's initiation rites.
Stan
Dude, stop it.
Butters
[back in the crowd] Let him have it, Stan!
Stan
Shut up, Butters!
Gary
The other kids are watching. Look, do what you gotta do. I won't fight back. I just hope that maybe afterwards we can... try to be friends someday.
Kyle
[back in the crowd] What are they doing?
Cartman
They're just standing there, talking. [A few moments later, Stan returns defeated. He glances back at Gary, then approaches the other boys]
Kyle
What happened? [Stan glances back, then looks at Kyle]
Stan
I'm... [stares back at Gary] going over to his house for dinner tonight.
Token
What?! How did that happen?
Stan
[stammering] He's a really nice kid.
Cartman
You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
Kyle
You're having dinner with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
Gary's house. His family is enjoying itself at the dinner table, playing a board game, "LIVING", and laughing.
Dad
Okay, my turn. [turns a little wheel] Ooo, five! [moves his piece] One two three four five. Uh, awww, lost your mortgage, pay ten thousand dollars! Oh no! [they all laugh. Gary and Stan enter]
Mom
Hey, it's Gary!
Older sister
Gary!
Older brother
Great to see you!
Mom
How are you?
Gary
Hey everybody! This is my new friend Stan. Stan, this is my mom and dad.
Dad
Hi Stan!
Mom
It's so nice to meet you.
Gary
[the camera pans to the older brother] And this is my brother Mark.
Mark
Hi!
Gary
[then to the older sister] My sister Jenny.
Jenny
Hey!
Gary
My little brother Dave.
Dave
Hi!
Gary
And my baby sister Amanda.
Amanda
[removes her pacifier] Hello Stan!
Dad
Well, it's great you could join us for Family Home Evening, Stan!
Stan
What's that?
Gary
That's when we don't allow any TV and just entertain each other with music and stories. Doesn't your family ever do that?
Stan
No.
Dad
Hey kids! Why don't you grab your instruments and play a song for Stan!
Jenny
Oh yeah!
Mark
All right! Let's play! [the kids grab their instruments. Jenny and Gary take guitars, Mark takes a trumpet, Dave takes the drums, and Amanda takes the little piano. The kids launch into song]
Gary
Yeah yeah, yeah, I love my family!
My family is the best!
If we ever have to face a challenge.

The kids
My family!
Gary
Can pass the test. [the parents bounce softly to the beat. Next scene, the family is back at table for dinner. Mom comes in with a big turkey platter]
Dad
Oh boy! Who is the best Mom in the world?? [the rest of the family chatters. Next scene shows Dave juggling three balls]
Mark
All right! Go Dave!
Gary
Yeah!
Jenny, Mark
Woohoo! [next scene is Mark doing Shakespeare's "Hamlet", with skull]
Mark
Where be your gibes now? Your gambols? Your songs? [next scene is Amando in Russian dress, dancing]
The Family
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! [next scene, they're all laughing at something]
Mark
That's a great story, Sarah.
Dad
All right, kids, now how about we do some Scripture readings! From the Book of Mormon!
Mark
All right!
Kids
Yeah!
Mark
Woohoo! OOWW!
Stan
The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
Gary
You know... the book that Joseph Smith found.
Stan
Who's Joseph Smith? [they laugh at his ignorance]
Mark
Only the most important person in the world.
Jenny
You've never heard of him?
Stan
No!
Gary
Tell us the story of Joseph Smith, Dad.
The other kids
Oh yes, tell us Dad. Yeah Dad. All right.
Dad
All right, you rascals. Gather round. [the kids draw closer to their dad] Joseph Smith lived in a little American town in the early 1800s.
A little American town in the early 1800s. A man rides by in a small carriage pulled by one horse. In the distance, Joseph Smith strolls into town.
Singers
Joseph Smith was called a prophet
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
He started the Mormon religion

Blacksmith
There goes that kooky Joseph Smith.
Customer
You know, he claims he spoke with God and Jesus.
Woman
Well, how do you know he didn't?
Singers
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Joseph Smith was called a prophet-

Butler
Hey, Joseph! I told my wife that you spoke with God and Jesus, and she didn't believe it.
Smith
Well it's true. I did.
Wife
Where?
Smith
I was out in the woods, praying [a shot of him on his knees in the woods] I was asking God if I should be a Protestant, or a Catholic, or what? And suddenly God and Jesus appeared before me. [a bright light appears before him and he shields his eyes from the glare] And they said I should start my own church, because none of the others had it right. [the flashback ends] And that's exactly how it happened.
Butler
You see? You believe it now?
Wife
Well yeah, sure. Why would he make that up?
Singers
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Many people believed Joseph
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And that night he-ee saw an angel
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Smith
[in bed inside a shack] And please bless Mother and Father, and please keep our bellies full of yum-yums and luscious goodies. [a flash of light and a glowing orb flies around the room] AAAHH! [the orb turns into an angel] Oh my gosh!
Angel
I am Moroni. I am a Native American.
Smith
A... [looks at the camera] Native American? [looks at Moroni] But your skin is white.
Moroni
Yes. Long ago all Native American were white. We all came to America from Jerusalem. And while we were here we were visited by Christ.
Smith
[looks at the camera] Jesus live here in America?
Moroni
Yes. Eventually, my people were all killed by the other tribe of Israel, and as punishment, God turned their skin red. These are the Native Americans you know today. [Smith looks at the camera dumbstruck]
Singers
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Moroni
There is an ancient book buried near here, written on gold plates that account my people's lives. Also buried with the book are two seer stones, the Urim and Thummim, which will allow you to translate the writings. Find it, and fulfill your destiny. [brightens and then vanishes]

Back to the present.
Dad
And we all know what happened then, don't we?
Kids
Yeah! I know!
Stan
What happened then? [a small timer rings]
Mom
Ooo, the Rice Crispy squares are done!
Kids
Rice Crispy squares! Yay! All right! Rice Crispy squares!
Dad
Hey gang, let's wrap some more of them up in plastic wrap and hand them out to the poor!
Gary
Awesome! I can't wait!
Jenny
Yeah! [the family rises from the couch and leaves]
Gary
You coming, Stan?
Stan
No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
Dad
Awww, that's too bad. Well, it was really nice meeting you, Stan. [the family returns and hugs Stan]
Mark, Jenny
Bye Stan!
Mom
Great to meet you!
Gary
Bye!
Stan's house, night. What a contrast. Randy watches TV on the couch with beer in hand, Shelly watches it on the floor, Sharon watches it from the dining table solving crossword puzzles. Stan enters upon this desolate scene.
Stan
...Hello?
Sharon
Oh, hi Stan.
Stan
[a few seconds later] Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
Randy
Who?
Shelly
Shut up, turd! We're watching Friends!
Stan
The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
Sharon
Well, Stan, God and Jesus don't actually speak to people.
Stan
That's not what the Harrisons said.
Randy
Who are the Harrisons?
Stan
The new people that moved in down the street. Mr. Harrison said that Joseph Smith spoke to God and Jesus and they told him none of the religions were right.
Randy
Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!
Stan
They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
Randy
We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
Stan
But that's just you and your friends.
Shelly
I said shut up, turd!
Stan
Mr. Harrison said that I should be following Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
Randy
[rises and moves towards the front door] All right, that does it!
Sharon
Where are you going?
Randy
I'm gonna go have a talk with this "Mr. Harrison." [grabs his coat from the coat rack and puts it on] If he thinks he can fill my son's head with wacko religious crap, he's wrong! [drinks the last of his beer]
Sharon
Randy, don't cause trouble.
Randy
Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass! [exits and slams the door shut, but quickly returns] This, Mr. Harrison is, is a white guy, right?
Stan
Yeah.
Randy
[confidence restored] Yeah, I'm gonna go kick his ass! [slams the door]
The neighborhood, night. Randy walks down the street.
Randy
God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! [approaches the front door of the house and pounds on the door. Gary's father answers it]
Mr. Harrison
Hello!
Randy
Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?
Mr. Harrison
I sure am. [offers his right hand] The, the name's Gary.
Randy
Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-
Gary Sr
Oh, you're Stan's dad! It's so nice to finally meet you! Karen! Mr. Marsh is here!
Randy
Uh, look, I just want to tell you that
Karen
[arrives with a tray of squares] Oh, Mr. Marsh! What a treat! It's so nice to meet you!
Randy
Well, thanks. Uh...
Gary Sr
Karen just finished baking the most amazing Rice Crispy squares.
Karen
With chocolate frosting
Gary Sr
Come on out of the cold. You've gotta try one. Or six. [chuckles]
The coffee table in the living room.
Gary Sr
I cannot tell you how wonderful it is to have you over.
Karen
[serving lemonade] I hear you're a geologist. That is so amazing.
Randy
Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.
Gary Sr., Karen
Uh huh?
Randy
You know. About... God, and stuff.
Gary Sr.
Oooh... Oh boy... you think we were trying to convert him.
Randy
Well, I...
Gary Sr.
Oh, Mr. Marsh, I am sooo sorry.
Karen
We just moved here from Utah and we're so used to everyone being Mormon that we... Oh, we forget not everyone wants to hear about it. Oh boy, you must be furious!
Randy
Well, no, no, I just...
Gary Sr.
You just heard your son talking about religious ideals that aren't your own and you said "Who the heck do these people think they are?!" I I'm really, truly sorry, Mr. Marsh. It won't happen again.
Randy
Y-you can call me... Randy.
Karen
Randy, the last thing we want is for people to think we're pushing our religion. We know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us.
Gary Sr.
To each his own, right?
Randy
Yeah. Yeah! You know, to be honest, I've never known any Mormons. I, don't even know what you people believe. Who was this Joseph Smith guy? Why did he believe that Native Americans are actually white people from Jerusalem?
Gary Sr.
Well, because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates, right where the angel Moroni said they would be.
The Early 1800s, day, a small town. People mill around.
Smith
I found them! I found them! [people turn and look, and he stops] You're not gonna believe it, everybody! I found them!
Butler
Found what?
Smith
Another New Testament of Jesus Christ!
People
What? What did he say? Are you crazy?
Smith
Last night, a Native America angel told me where I could find another testament of Jesus Christ, so I went out to the woods. I dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look. [a shot of Smith digging yet another hole].
Smith
Maybe there isn't anything out here. [strikes something hard] Wait a tick! [throws the shovel off to the side] What's this? [starts digging and find a tiny coffin, then removes the lid] Wow...
Smith
[back to the story] Inside the stone box, I found the magical seer stones. Under that, I found four gold plates written in strange writing [he lifts up two of them].
Smith
This must be the Gospel that Jesus told the Nephites!
Smith
Well, they were the most amazing things I'd ever gazed upon.
Man
[middle-aged] Well, so where are they?
Smith
Where are what?
Woman
The gold plates and the seer stones. Where are they?
Smith
Oh, well, I... was not allowed to take them. You see, after I found the plates, the angel Moroni appeared to me again and said that I am not allowed to show the plates, or the seer stones, to anybody. Because first I must translate what's written on the plates into English, so you can all read it!
Singers
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.
People
Wow, amazing!
Singers
He found the stones and golden plates
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Even though nobody else ever saw them
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

The Marsh house. Sharon and Shelly are at their spots, Stan sits on the couch, all three watch TV. Randy returns with a Book of Mormon in hand.
Sharon
So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
Randy
Not exactly. We're uh, having their family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Stan
See? That's what happened to me!
Randy
Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?
Sharon
What are you talking about?
Randy
Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.
Stan
That's what they made me think, too!
Randy
All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
The neighborhood, day. In front of Kyle's house Kyle, Kenny and Cartman are tossing a football around. Stan arrives. Cartman catches the football and approaches Stan.
Cartman
Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
Stan
Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
Cartman
[cooing] Aww, you guys. I think Stan's in love.
Kyle
Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
Stan
What's the big deal? Can't I have other friends? You guys should give Gary a chance.
Gary
[arrives] Hey Stan.
Cartman
Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
Gary
Hey guys. Stan, I remember you said last night that you'd lost your wallet, so I made you a new one. [hands Stan a brown leather wallet] I carved a picture of John Elway into the leather on the front.
Stan
Wow, you made this?
Cartman
[playing it up] Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
Gary
Hey! My family's on their way over to the fire station to donate blood. You wanna come along? [Cartman gags.]
Stan
Uh, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... [a car horn is heard]
Gary
Oh here comes my family now!
The Harrisons
Hey you guys! [they get out of the car]
Karen
Look, we painted our faces! [they laugh]
Mark
I'm a lion. [scratches the air like a lion might]
Jenny
I'm an alien. [green face paint]
Gary Sr.
Hey, just what the heck am I supposed to be? [they laugh]
Cartman
Oh my God...
Dave
[a piglet] You gonna come with us to the fire station, Stan?
Stan
[fumbling about] Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
Gary Sr.
Well... Gary, you wanna just hang out with your friend Stan?
Gary
Oh. Well, I'd like to, but... Oh man, I would miss you guys so much!
Mark
We'd miss you too, Gary. Heh.
Karen
Aw, we'll all see each other tonight when we go to Stan's house for dinner. Stay and play with your friend, Gary.
Gary Sr.
Yeah. Have a good time, boys. [the family laughs and gets inside the car]
Mark
Let's go. [the doors close and they drive off] Our faces are painted. [more laughter]
Kyle
Wow!
Gary
So what do you guys wanna do?
Cartman
[backs away a bit with Kyle and Kenny] Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. [looks at the other two. All three move off to their left and leave]
Gary
Oh cool! I'm gonna do that tomorrow.
Cartman
Eeheehee, Jesus Christ. [an awkward moment between Gary and Stan follows]
Gary
So hey, I heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about Joseph Smith. That's great!
Stan
[turns right and walks. Gary walks alongside] Yeah. I had a question about that Joseph Smith guy.
Gary
Sure.
Stan
What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
Gary
Well, he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told. And then he translated what was written on the plates into the Book of Mormon.
Stan
Yeah, but... how?
Back to the 1800s, night. Joseph Smith and another man walk up into the attic of a large building.
Singers
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Man
What's this all about, Mr. Smith?
Smith
Mr. Harris, can you keep a secret?
Harris
Well, sure I can.
Smith
I have, in my possession, an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of Jesus Christ's second coming. Here, in America.
Harris
In America? [scratches his head] Really? That sounds kind of...
Singers
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Smith
It's true. And I'm going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read. Now, ahah-I know you have a lot of money, Mr. Harris, and I'm just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs.
Harris
Mmm, I don't know. Uh, how do you expect to translate it?
Smith
With these. [presents the seer stones]
Harris
Rocks?
Smith
They're not rocks. They're seer stones, given to me by an angel. With them, God allowed me to translate the plates into English. Watch. You take this quill and paper and write down what I say. Sit here. [on the floor, by some sheets of paper and a quill pen in an ink well] I have the golden plates here in this hat. I need to have them somewhere dark so I can read the spiritual light.
Harris
Really?
Smith
Now, when I put the seer stones into the hat, the ancient letter light up and change into English, which I can then read to you.
Harris
Wow! [Smith looks down and lowers his head so the face is buried in the hat]
Smith
Ooo, I'm seeing the light. Oh, okay. Write this down. "And... so... it... was... that... Christ... appeared before... the... Nephites."
Singers
And that's how the Book of Mormon was written
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Dumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb, duuumb.

The Marsh house, night. At the dining table they're playing the same board game the Harrisons were playing a few nights before: "LIVING".
Randy
One two three four. "Pay one thousand dollars property tax." [pays the property tax] Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.
Shelly
I wanna watch TV.
Randy
We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
Stan
Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
Randy
And? [to Sharon] Your turn, Sharon.
Stan
It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
Randy
Yes.
Stan
But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.
Randy
Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly. [the doorbell rings] Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! [rises and goes to the front door. He opens and the Harrisons walk in with enthusiasm, chatting away]
Gary
Hey everybody.
Mark
[walks around] Wow, what a great house!
Karen
[walks up to Sharon] You must be Mrs. Marsh; it's so nice to meet you!
Jenny
[walks up to Shelly] And you must be Stan's sister. Oh, I think your brother's the greatest.
Shelly
My brother is a stupid turd.
Gary
[walks up to Stan] Hey Stan.
Stan
[with reservations] Hey Gary.
Randy
Well, come on in and sit down, everybody. [they all settle in on the couches in the living room. Shelly avoids looking at the Harrisons] You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
Stan
Dad!
Gary Sr.
Ohohoho, really? Well, that's just because he hasn't heard the best part about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real!
The Harrisons
Yeah! Woohoo!
Randy
Ooo, what's that?
Gary Sr.
Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?
Stan
Yeah.
Gary Sr.
See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.
Back to the 1800s, night, the large building.
Singers
Martin went home to his wife
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
And showed her pages from the Book of Mormon
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Harris
A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we're gonna publish it into a book.
Mrs. Harris
Martin, how do you know he isn't just making stuff up and pretending he's translating off golden plates?
Singers
Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Smart smart smart smart smart

Harris
Why would he make it up?
Singers
Martin Harris dumb dadumb-
Lucy
All right, here. I'm gonna hide these pages. [puts them in a drawer at the bottom end of an armoir] If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he'll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these.
Harris
Okay, fine. I bet he'll have no problem. [puts on his coat and heads out]
Singers
Lucy Harris smart smart smart
Martin Harris dumb.
So Martin went on back to Smith
Said the pages had gone away
Smith got mad and told Martin
He needed to go pray
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb

Harris
[upon Smith's return] Look, ah I'm sorry about losin' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I'm ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.
Smith
I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he's very angry with me for letting you take those pages.
Harris
[gasps] He is??
Singers
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
Smith
Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He's... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.
Harris
Wow! If God got angry with you, then you must be tellin' the truth.
Singers
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.
Harris
All right, Martin. Let's get to work! [Smith reads from the hat again and dictates to Harris, who writes it all down]
Back to the present, the Marsh house.
Gary Sr.
And that's how it happened.
Kids
Yeah! All right! [the Marshes sit there without a word to say]
Stan
...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
Gary Sr.
Well sure. The story proves it, doesn't it?
Stan
No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
Mark
Well, Stan, it's all a matter of faith.
Stan
No, it's a matter of logic! If you're gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you'd better have something to back it up. All you've got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn't do it again when the translations were hidden!
Randy
Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.
Stan
[crosses his arms] I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!
Shelly
Me neither.
Gary
Hey, that's only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!
Gary Sr.
Yeah, it's great you have your own beliefs.
Gary
Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!
Stan
Oh, stop it! [stands up] That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
Randy
Yeah! [moments later they are standing outside, and the door is slammed on their faces. They turn around, and Gary Sr. sighs]
Gary Sr.
Well kids... Who's up for a water balloon fight?!
Kids
Yeah! All right! [they leave the Marsh house in high spirits, except Gary, who looks insulted]
The bus stop, next day. Kyle, Cartman and Kenny wait for the bus, Stan walks up somewhat somberly.
Kyle
Oh, hey Stan. Where's your best buddy, Gary?
Stan
I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.
Cartman
[needling] Oh no! You guys broke up?
Stan
You guys were right, okay? The new kid's a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.
Gary
[shows up] Hey Stan.
Stan
Oh brother.
Cartman
Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
Gary
Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don't have to worry about me tryin' to be your friend anymore.
Stan
I don't?
Gary
Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don't care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in this town might think that's stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you're so high and mighty you couldn't look past my religion and just be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. [turns around and walks off. All four boys just look at him in wonder.]
Cartman
Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
End of All About Mormons

Butt Out
South Park Elementary, gymnasium, day. A school meeting is called and kids file in. Between two basketball backboards hangs a blue banner with the words "BUTT OUT!" The O doubles as a no-smoking symbol. There's plenty of chatter in the gym.
Mr. Mackey
[off-screen] M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please? M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet ple-mk-m'kay? [Mr. Garrison approaches him, takes the microphone and puts it against one of the massive speakers, creating a loud feedback loop. The kids scream in pain as Mr. Garrison returns the mic to Mr. Mackey.] M'kay. Uh, now kids, we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking, m'kay? So please give a very big South Park Cows welcome to, "Butt Out!" [music starts up and a very enthusiastic troupe dashes out from behind the speakers and multi-screen monitor. After some chatter they begin to sing]
Butt Out!
Butt out! Yeah yeah! Kids, that cigarette butt is gross!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go! [the music stops and the troupe members strike poses]

Kyle
[rolls his eyes] Oh no...
Butt Out!
Yeah! All right! Woohoo!!
Butt Out! Lady
Hey students, how are we all feelin' today? Woooo! [not a sound emanates from the student audience]
Butt Out! Man 1
[steps forth] Hey, did you guys know that each year over six hundred thousand people a year die from smoking? A year!
Butt Out! Man 2
[steps forth] Six hundred thousand?? Are you sure you're not just blowing smoke? [the troupe members laugh]
Butt Out! Lady
Blow smoke? Us? No way! Because we don't need to smoke and neither do you, right kids? Butt out! Break it down! [a rap begins. The third male trouper becomes a human beat box.]
Butt Out!
Butt out! Yeah yeah! It's cool to say no!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!

Butt Out! Man 3
[steps forward and begins his beat box, just a bunch of utterances including] Smoking, no. No smoking. [ends his bit and backs up]
Butt Out! Man 2
Freestyle!
Butt Out! Lady
Vernon! [The first of the Butt Out! males steps forth while the third one resumes his beat box]
Vernon
Don't smoke! Don't ever smoke!
Butt Out!
Kyle! [Vernon steps back into the line, the second But Out! male steps forth]
Butt Out!'s Kyle
B to the U to the T to the T to the O to the U to the T to the C to the I to the G to the A to the R to the E to the T to the T to the E! Butt out, cigarette!
Kyle Broflovski
Dude, this is unbearable.
Cartman
I'm going to kill myself. [return to the rap, which soon ends and Butt Out!'s Kyle goes back in line]
Butt Out!
Randy!
Randy
[steps forth] Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the "no" to the smoke, you go go.. [Stan holds his nose, grimaces and sighs heavily] ... you gotta get it!
Butt Out!
Pam!
Pam
[steps forth and makes like a diesel truck pulling to a stop. In a screeching voice she says] Dooooonttt smooooke.
Butt Out!
Woohoo! [she goes back into the line]
Cartman
You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. [Kenny's mittens are against his lips. Stan and Kyle are half asleep]
Butt Out!'s Kyle
Hey! What's the big deal? I like smoking, and it makes me cool! [turns his hat around so it's on backwards, and strikes a pose]
Pam
Oh, really?? Do you think lung cancer is cool, too?? [Butt Out!'s Kyle strikes a surprised pose]
Randy
What about emphysema?? Is that cool?? [Butt Out!'s Kyle clasps his hands together]
Vernon
And what about abortion, and AIDS? [Butt Out!'s Kyle slumps]
Randy
Pfft! That's none's the cool.
Pam
Word.
Vernon
Yeah. So butt out! [Butt Out!'s Kyle turns his hat back around]
Butt Out!
Butt out! Yeah yeah! Give that cigarette butt a throw!
Stan
[Rolls eyes] Ugh, Jesus Christ! [Cartman has his hands buried in his face]
Butt Out!
Butt out! Uh huh! Smokin's got to go!
Vernon
Remember, kids, if you smoke, you could grow up to be a failure.
Pan
Worse yet, you could grow up to be dead. [collapses into Vernon's arms. He stands her up again]
Butt Out!'s Kyle
So don't believe what those evil tobacco companies tell you!
Randy
Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-
Butt Out!
[strikes one final pose] Just Like Us. [the boys look at each other, not quite sure what to make of that]
South Park Elementary, loading area. The boys are there next to a trash bin, smoking ... and coughing.
Stan
Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. [takes a cigarette from Kyle's pack, lights up, and puffs]
Kyle
Aw dude, this is really hard.
Cartman
Oh shit, here comes Mr. Mackey. [the boys quickly turn away and toss the cigarettes and lighter into the trash bin]
Kyle
Throw 'em away! [the boys' faces are red. Kyle glances back] Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. [the boys stifle their coughs as Mr. Mackey draws near.]
Mr. Mackey
[stops, then walks around to face the boys] Boys, what are you doing back here? [the boys try their best to keep their coughs in check] I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?!
Cartman
[in clipped tones] Nothing.
Mr. Mackey
What??
Cartman
Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. [moments later Stan sneezes, and a large amount of snot ends up on his face and jacket]
Kyle
[looks] D'awww sick! [Stan coughs and tries to cover his mouth]
Cartman
Gross dude! [with the stifles broken, the boys resume coughing]
Mr. Mackey
Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking!
Cartman
No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
Mr. Mackey
Well you'd better not! Because let me tell you some'n' about smokin'! [a burst of flame appears in the trash bin] Uh, smokin's bad, m'kay. [the boys look a bit alarmed] And uh, if you start smokin' at an early age, m'kay, it's gonna be bad. [the wall behind the bin and one of the posts holding up the awning over the loading dock burst into flame. The boys are getting scared. More of the wall bursts into flames and the flames begin to enter classrooms] M'kay, because uh, smoking can lead to all kinds of health problems like cancer. [the rest of the awning bursts into flames and flames appear at the bottom of the roll-away security door] M'kay, and let me tell you something about cancer, m'kay. Cancer's bad. M'kay, and uh, eh, what? [sniffs] What the? [turns around] Holy shit! M'kay?! [the fire alarm goes off and the school empties out the front door. Mr. Garrison, Mr. Adler, Ms. Choise, and Mr. Slave are all seen]
Mr. Slave
Oh! Jesus Christ! [time-lapse a few hours. The school has been gutted by the flames and firefighters clean up. Police are present for crowd control. Mr. Mackey is none too pleased]
Stan
...Whoops.
The Principal's office, Only the door and the desk remain. The bookshelves are burnt up except for the bottom shelf. The cabinets are charred. The desk is charred and two of its legs are burnt off.
Principal Victoria
[seated behind her desk] Well, you boys have certainly done it this time!
Cartman
We're sorry.
Principal Victoria
Not as sorry as you're going to be when your parents get here! Ah, here they come now. [sure enough, their parents can be seen approaching through the ruins]
Kyle
Oh God... [looks down. One of the parents knocks.]
Principal Victoria
Come on in. [Randy opens the door and the parents enter]
Sharon
Stanley, what did you do this time?!
Principal Victoria
You'd better brace yourself, parents. The boys were caught... smoking!
Sheila
Smoking?
Sharon
No, it can't be! My son is not a filthy smoker! [begins to sob. Randy holds her]
Stan
Mom... [Randy holds her tight] Dad, it was just a-
Randy
I don't have a son!
Liane
Eric, you've done a lot of horrible things in your life, but smoking? You're grounded for three weeks!
Cartman
Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
Gerald
Haven't you boys heard anything about how harmful smoking is to you and those around you?
Sheila
Of course they haven't, because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first. This is really their fault
Kyle
[seizing the opportunity] Yeah. This is really their fault.
Sheila
No matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend, the tobacco companies are there to fill our children's heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke.
Cartman
[agreeing] Yeah, huh? [launches into a small demonstration] It-it's like the tobacco companies have control of my mind- No. Must. Fight it. Tobacco companies... making me want to smoke. Ah!
Liane
Oh my goodness, I had no idea. [kneels next to him] Are you okay, sweetie?
Randy
Well, those God-damned tobacco companies aren't gonna have control over MY kid! I say we bring them down!
Sheila
We need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived. Rob Reiner.
Kyle
[to Stan] Who's Rob Reiner?
Rob Reiner's Smoke Stoppers, day. A blue skyscraper flanked by two taller blue towers, with the Hollywood sign in the background. Inside, Rob Reiner speaks to four executives, but he's facing the window. He's reading from some papers.
Rob Reiner
[breathless, dabs his forehead] I don't understand it. I pushed a law for higher taxes on cigarettes, I lobbied to get images of cigarettes removed from movies and art, I forced smokers out of bars and parks, but still I get letters from parents saying their kids are doin' it. [puts the papers on the desk, unwraps a triple cheeseburger, starts eating it, and sits down at his desk] Apparently, people still don't understand how bad smoking people is for them. Don't they know how dangerous it is to their health? [dabs his forehead] Don't they know the hazard of second-hand smoke?
Executive 1
According to the letter, sir, the town has a tobacco company quite near them.
Rob Reiner
Yeah, that must be it. [dabs his forehead] The tobacco companies, with their millions of dollars and their slick desks and fancy buildings, [the camera pulls out to show the slick desk and fancy building Reiner is in. Reiner dabs his forehead again] they're the ones making music wanna smoke! [dabs his forehead again, opens another triple cheeseburger and begins munching on that] They're the ones hurting our nation's health! I will not stand by and see the children of America corrupted by those bastards! [dabs his forehead] This is war!!
South Park City Hall, day. People have gathered to greet Reiner when he arrives, and some people have signs saying the same thing as the banner. Other signs say "THANKS ROB!!", "Welcome MEATHEAD!" and "Give 'em hell REINER!" Stan and friends wait by the front door.
Kyle
You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
Stan
What??
Cartman
Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
Stan
Yeah, what's the problem?
Kyle
Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
Cartman
Dumbass, you don't wanna be grounded for three weeks, do you?
Stan
Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
Mr. Garrison
Here he comes! [Two Smoke Stoppers vans and a big rig pull up to City Hall. Rob Reiner follows in a Cadillac, which stops at the walkway leading up to the front door. Reiner opens the door and tries to get out, but he's too big to fit through.]
Rob Reiner
[after a few grunts] Damnit. [struggles some more, but fails to move any] Butter! [the driver glances back] Butter! [the driver exits the car and walks around the front]
Mr. Garrison
What'd he say?
Rob Reiner
Butter!! [the driver arrives with a bucket of butter. Rob Reiner grabs a bunch of it and butters himself up. The driver leaves with the butter as Reiner rubs the last of it against the seat of his pants. Reiner struggles once more and pops out of the cor, falling to the ground. He stumbles, then rises and stumbles again. This time he stands up and raises his hands in victory. This raises his sweater, and his belly is exposed. He notices this and lowers his sweater. He raises his hands again and his sweater rises. He lowers his hands and walks up to the dais. The mic transmits his breathlessness as he dabs his forehead. His cheeks are rosy from the heat leaving his head] Hello South Park!! [the crowd cheers, the boys look at each other] It is so nice to see an entire town come together to fight for good health! And I'm gonna help ya! [the crowd cheers] These poor innocent children have been seduced into smoking tobacco. So I say, "We fight fire with fire!" We're gonna use these children to bring the tobacco companies down! [someone shoots some confetti in the air and it rains down over everybody.]
Kyle
Oh no...
The town bar. Reiner sits at a booth with the boys, feverishly eating. A waitress comes up with a platter of cheeseburgers and fries.
Rob Reiner
Alright kids, here's what we're gonna do. [the waitress replaces a cleared platter with the newly loaded one] We're gonna sneak you into the tobacco company by saying you kids want a tour for a school paper. [begins eating the burgers and dabs his head] Once you're inside, mm, mm, I'm gonna take photos and then we'll publish them, saying that the tobacco company invited you over to seduce you into smoking. Got it?
Cartman
Got it! [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
Kyle
But... isn't that, kind of, lying?
Rob Reiner
Uh, we're just leveling out the playing field. [dabs his forehead] The tobacco companies lie to you about the dangers of smoking. If we're gonna take them down, we've gotta lie right back! [begins to sniff around after detecting cigarette smoke, then focuses in on the source. The boys look as well. The source is a man wearing a Buds Light Beer hat, enjoying a drink and a smoke at the bar] Oh my God! [coughs loudly, but fails to get the man's attention. He rises from the booth and walks up to the smoker] Excuse me!
BUDS Man
Yes?
Rob Reiner
Would you mind putting that death stick out?!
BUDS Man
But, uh, this is a bar.
Rob Reiner
Isn't smoking illegal in bars here?
Bartender
Not in Colorado.
Rob Reiner
Oh my God! What kind of backward hick state is this?!
BUDS Man
Look man, I work fourteen hours a day at the saw mill. I just got off work and I need to relax.
Rob Reiner
Well when I relax I just go to my vacation house in Hawaii!
BUDS Man
[getting irritated] I ain't got a vacation house in Hawaii!
Rob Reiner
Your vacation house in Mexico, then, whatever it is! Look, you are putting my life and these boys' lives in danger by smoking that in here! And I'm not gonna tolerate it! I will end smoking in bars in Colorado! There will be no more smoking here!
Back at the table...
Cartman
[impressed] Isn't he awesome, you guys?
Kyle
What??
Cartman
Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. [pics up an onion ring and munches on it]
Big Tobacco Co., day. Reiner and the boys approach the front door.
Rob Reiner
[turns to face the boys] All right boys, just do what I tell ya and we'll be able to sue this tobacco company for two billion dollars! [pulls out a drumstick from his sack and starts eating it] As soon as we get into the main facility, I'll snap the photo of you kids, and we can all run out! Think you can handle it?
Cartman
Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
Rob Reiner
Heh, great. [opens the sack and pulls out a costume] Okay, now watch yourselves, kids. These tobacco company people will do anything to get you hooked on smoking. They are liars and they are frauds!
Big Tobacco Co., headquarters. A door opens and closes.
Receptionist
Can I help you?
Rob Reiner
[now dressed in the costume he pulled out] Yes. My name is Rita Poon. I called about my boys wanting a tour.
Executive
[enters the scene] Ah, yes, Mrs. Poon. My name's Kevin Harris and I'm the vice president of Big Tobacco.
Rob Reiner
Oh. Hello, Mr. Harris.
Kevin Harris
Well, come on in. [motions the group to a hallway, which they enter] How about a little history first? [stops by a portrait of Indians seated around a campfire] Native Americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant. They smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes.
Rob Reiner
[mutters] Not if I were around, they wouldn't have.
Kevin Harris
Excuse me?
Rob Reiner
Oh, nothing! Please continue.
Kevin Harris
The first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in Virginia in 1612. [stops by a portrait of Pilgrims harvesting the crop] Within seven years it was one of the country's largest exports.
Kyle
So, tobacco helped to build America.
Kevin Harris
That's right. Over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from Africa to help work the fields.
Cartman
[strokes his chin] Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
Kevin Harris
[moves on] And so for centuries, tobacco production flourished. Nobody was even aware of any dangers back then, until, in 1965, [stops at a framed tobacco warning] when Congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the Surgeon General's warning on their packages. So now, everyone knows the dangers of smoking. And some people still choose to do it, and we believe that's what being an American is all about.
Kyle
That sounds perfectly reasonable.
Kevin Harris
And here's our factory at work. [opens the double doors to the factory. The workers begin to sing. Some of them scoop tobacco plants into large tanks. Other collect minced leaves into large wheelbarrows, others keep inventory. They break into song and dance near the end of the song]
Factory workers
With a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay
We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day
So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives
And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night

Young Worker
I like to have a cigarette every now and then [turns around]
It makes me fee-l calmer when the day is at an end. [hops onto the wheelbarrow and rides away]

Older Worker
And if it gives me cancer when I'm eighty I don't care
Who the hell wants to be ninety anyway.

Factory workers
So with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey lay
We work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey day
So folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey lives
And relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night

Kevin Harris
Well, I guess that's the end of our tour.
Rob Reiner
Oh, here boys. Let me get your picture. [the boys turn around and Reiner takes the picture] Got it! Ha! You bastards are going down now!
Kevin Harris
What??
Rob Reiner
I'm not Rita Poon! I'm Rob Reiner! [takes off the wig] And you've just been Reinered! Come on boys, let's make our escape! [makes a dash for the exit. A worker with a cart of cases of cigarettes is gong about his business] Don't you try and stop us! [he smacks the worker, who goes down cold. He runs further on and picks up another worker over his head, then throws him down onto the floor below. The other workers panic]
Kevin Harris
[looks down at the mayhem] Oh my God!
Temporary Smoke Stoppers offices, night. Reiner and the boys arrive.
Rob Reiner
Hoh boy, that was great, kids.
Stan
Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
Rob Reiner
Hah, you see that? They got into your head. Now you kids can meet some good, decent people, the folks who work to get smoking banned!
Temporary Smoke Stoppers offices, interior. The workers there walk around like zombies, or Igor, Dr. Frankenstein's helper. They make grunts as they pass each other. The woman runs off and the man chases after her.
Rob Reiner
[walks across the room towards a table laden with burgers] This is how we get rid of smokers. [approaches and grabs a burger] We go state to state and do things like, use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop!
Cartman
Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them. [cuddles up to Reiner] You are so awesome.
Rob Reiner
[walks up to an employee and hands him the camera. The worker hooks it up to his computer] Here you go Bob. [Explains to the boys] This is Mr. Baffrey. He does all our Photoshop work. [the screen is shown with a picture loading behind a download progress bar] Now, all we have to do is Photoshop cigarettes into your hands! [Baffrey places cigarettes into the boys' hands] And bingo! When this hits the papers the tobacco company is screwed! Hahahaha! [Baffrey joins in the laughter]
Kyle
But dude, you're making stuff up.
Rob Reiner
[munching on another burger] You kids need to understand something, okay? Sometimes lying is okay. Like, when you know what's good for people more than they do.
Cartman
Oh my God, that is what I've always said. [motions to Reiner] I love this guy!
Worker
[walks in with a news feed] Mr. Reiner, your bill to have smoking outlawed at bars here didn't pass.
Rob Reiner
What?! [grabs the news feed the worker was holding] God-damnit, what the hell is wrong with people in this state?!
Worker
Apparently, several people here still believe there's no proof second-hand smoke can kill you.
Rob Reiner
Well they want proof?! All right, we'll give them proof! Boys, I need one of you to act in a commercial for us! We'll shoot it tomorrow!
Cartman
[eagerly] Wow, a commercial?
Rob Reiner
And you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part. All right people, we've gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in Potsdam! Let's go!
Cartman
God, he's just the best! [rushes off to follow Reiner] Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
Outside the tent. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny rush out of there and stop some distance away from it.
Kyle
Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
Stan
Huh?
Kyle
This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
Kenny
(Well yep, that's what I think.)
Stan
Yeah, maybe you're right. [Cartman walks out and catches up to the others]
Cartman
So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
Kyle
Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
Cartman
[confused] Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
Kyle
No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
Cartman
Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, "How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't [poke] gonna [poke] work [poke] on [poke] me [poke] ha [poke] ha [poke] ha [poke]. Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. [leaves]
Kyle's house, night. Cartman climbs up to the second story and opens a window at the end of the hallway. He carries with him a bunch of lumber, a hammer, and some nails. He approaches Kyle's door and gets to work hammering the lumber in place over the door.
Cartman
Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now. [Cartman forgets that hallway doors open in to their respective rooms] Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- [Kyle appears next to him with a glass of water]
Kyle
What are you doing? [Cartman snaps his head around and looks]
Cartman
[drops his hammer in this awkward moment] Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man. Wait, this isn't my house.
Kyle
Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. [walks around Cartman, opens the door, goes under lumber obstruction, enters the bedroom, then closes the door. Cartman is a bit surprised]
Cartman
Hahahahahaha! [resumes hammering] Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
Temporary Smoke Stoppers offices, day. Cartman is at the photo shoot getting makeup, being prepped for the shot.
Rob Reiner
Okay Eric, this is going to be real simple. All you gotta do is read the words on the Teleprompter here. [motions to the monitor to his right, which has the Teleprompter ready to go]
Cartman
[giddily] Heh, okay. [the make-up crew leave]
Rob Reiner
Let's see how the tobacco companies deal with this. [settles into his director's chair] All right, roll camera. Roll the TelePrompTer. And whenever you're ready, Eric.
Cartman
Heh, okay, okay. [takes a deep breath, then strikes a somber pose] You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead. [takes a closer look at that last line, then looks at Reiner] Dead??
Rob Reiner
And cut! Great! We got it! Wrap it up, people. That was fantastic.
Cartman
Uh what... what does that mean, "I'll be dead"? Hey, uh what, what was that "dead" part?
Scary Assistant
That was very good, Eric. Here, eat this cupcake.
Cartman
Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
Scary Assistant
But you are. Just eat this one cupcake. It has... sprinkles.
Cartman
[pushes the cupcake away] I'm not eating the cupcake.
Rob Reiner
[approaches Eric] Eric, do you know what a hero is? A hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others. You can be a hero, Eric. All you have to do... is eat the cupcake. [the scary assistant moves it towards Eric's mouth again]
Cartman
[realizes what the words he said mean and bolts from the stool] Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
Rob Reiner
[gives chase] Hey! [Eric runs out a side door, Reiner follows close behind]
Stan's house. The other boys are in the dining room playing cards. Cartman opens the door, runs in, and closes it quick. He then goes to a window and looks to see if he's being followed.
Stan
What are you doing, Cartman?
Cartman
They're going to kill me! [walks to the other window and looks out]
Kyle
Who's going to kill you?
Cartman
The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
Stan
[pushes away from the table] Well, get away from us then.
Kyle
Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. [the boys leave the table]
Cartman
[draws close] You guys have to help me!
Kyle
[the other boys back away] No dude, get away!
Cartman
[draws close] Please, you guys, I don't know what to do!
Stan
Stop it, Cartman! Go die on your own!
Cartman
If I go, you guys go!
Stan
Daaaad!
Randy
[enters from the kitchen] What?
Stan
Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us!
Randy
Don't be ridiculous, boys. The anti-smoking people are kind, caring, and intelligent. Your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies. [turns around and goes back into the kitchen]
Cartman
Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! [the boys keep their distance]
Stan
Help you, fatass! We weren't in the commercial, remember?
Kyle
Yeah! Go to the tobacco company yourself!
Cartman
Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! [crosses his arms]
Kyle
Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.
Kenny
(Uh huh.)
Cartman
You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company!
Stan
[yielding] Oh all right.
Kyle
No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
Stan
Why?
Kyle
Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
Stan
So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. [all the boys stroke their chins]
Big Tobacco Co., night. The town arrives with all the townspeople carrying torches and clamoring.
Kyle
God-damnit! [Cartman hides behind Mr. Harris upon seeing Rob Reiner]
Rob Reiner
Give us the child!
Kevin Harris
We will not!
Rob Reiner
There, you see that?! The tobacco company won't give us the kid! And do you know why?! Because they know that if they give us that kid, then we'll kill him! And when our commercial goes on the air, it will lose them business!
Townspeople
Yeah! Yeah, that's right!
Mr. Mackey
[suddenly realizes] Wait a minute, what?
Rob Reiner
Yeah. When we kill the kid, people are gonna think it's because of second-hand smoke! And then these bastards are all gonna make money, and they know it! [crowd goes silent]
Randy
Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
Rob Reiner
Oh, God-damnit, do I have to explain this again?! Smoking is bad, people! So if we have to be a little extreme to stop it, it's okay!
Kyle
No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate- [to Stan] See, I knew it.
Stan
Yup.
Kyle
You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
Rob Reiner
God-Damnit There'll be no more smoking!!
Stan
It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
Mr. Mackey
You're right, boys, m'kay?
BUDS Man
Yeah. Let smokers smoke.
Townspeople
Yeah!!
Mr. Garrison
Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! [they all laugh]
Rob Reiner
[holding a big slice of chocolate cake] I'm warning you: don't mess with anti-smoking groups!
Cartman
[approaches Reiner] I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! [takes the fork Reiner was holding and jabs it into his belly, Reiner begins to deflate as fat gushes out of the punctures Cartman made with the fork]
Rob Reiner
My goo! My precious goo! [apparently, there were no bones there. All that's left of Reiner is a puddle of fat and the skin it was all in. Cartman returns to the other boys, and the parents gather around them]
Sheila
So Kyle, it wasn't the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke?
Kyle
No.
Sheila
Well then, you are grounded, mister!
Liane
You too, Eric.
Cartman
Aw awww!
Added in later showings of the episode.
Stan
Well, I guess we learned our lesson.
Kyle
No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! [walks off]
End of Butt Out

Raisins
South Park Elementary playground, recess or lunch. The camera pans across the playground and settles on two teams of seven players each. A football lies on the ground between the two groups. The group left of the football consists of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Butters, Token, and Clyde. The second includes Craig, Tweek, Kevin, Pip, and three others
Stan
All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third "set hut!" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
Cartman
Right. What are we playing again?
Stan
Football.
Cartman
Got it. [the teams get into position]
Stan
Okay. 23! [Bebe appears behind him and taps him on the shoulder] Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! [Bebe taps him on the shoulder again. Stan turns and looks at her]
Bebe
Wendy breaks up.
Stan
What? [looks let down]
Bebe
Wendy breaks up with you. [turns to walk away. Stan looks on for a few seconds]
Stan
[moves forth to hold her up] Oh whoa, wait a minute. [Bebe turns around] What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks. [This gets the other boys' attention]
Bebe
She just doesn't wanna be with you anymore. She said she still wants to be friends. [the other boys turn to see what's going on]
Cartman
What-ever, Bebe! Like Stan really cares! Just get out of our football game, you stupid skank!
Bebe
Fuck you, fatass! You guys are assholes!
Butters
Oh yeah? Well, at least we have assholes, you dumb girl!
Cartman
Yeh-heah, right!
Bebe
God, you're so stupid! [turns around and walks away]
Cartman
What a whore! [turns around and goes back to the game. The other boys do the same. Stan is too stunned to move]
Kyle
Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up! [The boys get back into their playing positions. A few moments Kyle looks back] Stan? [Clyde looks back, then Cartman]
Cartman
[turns around] Come on, Stan, it's first down still. [Butters looks back, then Kenny. Stan loses heart and walks off slowly, his head hanging low. The other boys look at each other, unsure what to make of that. A montage begins.]
Stan is next seen walking onto a small red stone bridge. The next scene has him walking down the middle of a two-lane road in the rain. He stops to take in the moist air. The next scene has him back on the bridge, looking over the creek with his head on his right hand. On the water he sees a reflection of Wendy walk up to him. She's smiling. He brightens as she approaches. He turns to greet her, but there's no one to greet. He looks back at the creek, then turns around and walks off. The next scene has him at a rainy night sitting on the curb in a run-down part of town, under a working street light, with his face buried in his legs, crying. The last scene has him in his room, sitting on the floor by his bed, looking at a picture of Wendy. He gently strokes the picture, which has Wendy holding a daisy and smiling broadly. On the picture are written the words "I love you forever. Wendy." The image fades to black
South Park Elementary, day. In the hallway Craig goes to a drinking fountain for a drink of water. Fosse and Dog Poo walk towards the camera. Stan is at the far end watching Wendy open her locker. Stan looks away and walks towards Kyle, who's seated next to his locker reading a book.
Stan
Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
Kyle
[not looking up] Why?
Stan
'Cause I need to know why she broke up.
Kyle
Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
Stan
[pleading] Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
Kyle
[puts his book down and sighs] God damn it! [walks over to Wendy, but avoids eye contact] Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. [Wendy turns around]
Wendy
Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.
Kyle
'Kay. [walks back to Stan, but avoids looking at him, as well] She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
Stan
What? That's no answer! [nudges him a bit] Go tell her to be more direct with me.
Kyle
[goes for his books and picks them up] No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. [walks off. Jimmy appears]
Stan
Kyle, this is my life. [points at Jimmy] Jimmy!
Jimmy
Hey Stan.
Stan
Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
Jimmy
For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?
Stan
Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her, [thinks] tell her... [gestures] she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
Jimmy
She's what?
Stan
She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
Jimmy
...Okay. [walks over to Wendy] Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wendy. [she turns around with her books]
Wendy
Yeah?
Jimmy
Stan says you're a cont...[pronouncing as "cunt"] you're a- cont- S-Stan says you're a cont- cont-
Wendy
Well tell Stan to fuck off!! [closes her locker and runs away]
Jimmy
-cont- You're a cont-tinuing source of inspiration to him. [his mission done, he returns to Stan]
Stan
Well?
Jimmy
She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. [hangs his head for emphasis, then walks off]
Stan
[softly] Over? [walks away dejected. He's next seen in bed, a blanket hung across his window blocking out the outside light. He has his sheets drawn up tight against his chin. A few moments later, Kyle enters with Butters, Cartman, Jimmy and Kenny. Kyle studies his friend.] Jesus...
Butters
We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
Stan
[softly, creaking] ...Go away.
Kyle
Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
Stan
Why? What's the point of living when the only girl I ever loved is gone?
Cartman
God, what a fag!
Kyle
Dude, not now! [Cartman looks down, embarrassed]
Stan
You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
Kyle
Jeez, he's worse than I thought.
Butters
Well what do we do now?
Jimmy
Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
Kyle
No. We just have to show him that there's other girls out there. I say we take him to Raisins.
Butters
What's Raisins?
Next day, Raisins, a Hooters-like restaurant with al-fresco dining. The boys enter the restaurant, and a pretty little girl in a Raisins outfit walks up. Other girls walk around, all seem to work there
Blonde
Hey guys, welcome to Raisins. Six of you? [smiles and grabs some menus from the counter] Right over here. [leads the boys to their table]
Redhead
[waits at a table] So you guys having a good time today?
Diners
[Table 1, say, enthralled] Uh huh...
Blonde 2
[waits at the next table] How about some more fun fries, guys?
Diners
[Table 2, enthralled] Okay... [the waitress at the other end of the table smiles]
Brunette
[at the same table] Boy, am I glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
Blonde
[leaving them at their table] Here you go, guys. Lexus will be right with you.
Kyle
What do you think, Stan. These girls are pretty cute, huh?
Jimmy
Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven.
Butters
This place is awesome!
Cartman
How do you know? We haven't even tried the food yet.
Lexus
[with flyaway light brown hair] Hey guys.
Butters
Whoa!
Lexus
How are we doing this afternoon?
The Boys
Good.
Lexus
I'm so glad you guys came in. Everyone here is such a loser, but you guys seem really cool.
Butters
[amazed] W-we are.
Lexus
So what can I get you?
Cartman
Okay, um, we're gonna get the zingy tangy wings, and mozzarella tasty tarts [Lexus winks at Butters] and uh, OH, and the bite-size pizzazzas, and a pitcher of lemonade.
Lexus
Great. I'll put your order in right now. [strokes Butters' shoulders, which sends shivers of excitement through his body]
Butters
You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
Lexus
[near the kitchen] Raisins, girls! [sends an order along a conveyor to the kitchen staff]
Blonde 3
Woohoo!
Redhead
Oh Yeah!
Brunette 2
[farther away] Do it!
Kyle
Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh? [a Raisins girl walks by with long black hair] Why don't you say hi to her? [calls out] Excuse me? [motions for her to come over]
Brunette 3
[walks back and to the table] Hi guys. My name's Porsche.
Kyle
Hey. Uh, this is Stan.
Porsche
Oh hey cutie. How are you? I love your hat. I used to have a hat juuust like that, except, it was black and it didn't have a puffball on it. Oh my God, my hands are sooo cold. How come people have hands, anyway? Did you ever wonder that? [Stan looks more and more miserable with every word coming out of her mouth.]
Some time later, still dining. The Village People's "YMCA" begins to play, and some Raisins girls begin to dance
Raisins Girls
YMCA... [they make the hand signs for the letters. The rest of the diners look over at them and cheer them on] YMCA-A.
Cartman
[really stuffed, with a soiled face] Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... [their meals have been served]
Porsche
[still regaling Stan, who hasn't touched his food] Have you ever noticed how much sand there is at the beach? I mean, haven't you ever wondered where all this sand came from? Omigod, this one time, I saw a beetle that was thiiis big. Eeewww!
Stan
Can we go, please?
Kyle
Okay. Okay, come on you guys. [they all hop off their seats and walk off]
Porsche
Oooh my God, thank you guys sooo much for coming to Raisins! [Butters is last to leave]
Lexus
[sees him and stalls him] Oooh, sweetie, are you leaving?
Butters
Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
Lexus
Awww, well, when am I gonna get to see you again??
Butters
When do you wanna see me?
Lexus
[holds on to him] As soon as possible!
Butters
Oh my God! Here, we left you a tip already, but here is another five dollars. [hands her the bill]
Lexus
Oooh, you are such a sweetie. Come here, youuu! [comes around and gives him a full embrace]
Butters
[hugs her back] Waa... ahaaah... [the other boys arrive at the entrance]
Raisins Girl
Bye, guys! Thanks for coming to Raisins!
Jimmy
Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?
Stan
No, dude, I feel worse!
Kyle
Look, we're just trying to show you there's other girls out there.
Stan
Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
Butters
[catches up to the other boys] She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
Stan
I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! [turns and opens one of the doors]
Kyle
What are you doing?
Stan
Something I should have done a long time ago. [walks out the door and into the night]
Bebe's house, night. Stan walks towards the front door, looks around, and knocks three times. No response, so he knocks again. The door opens and Bebe appears
Stan
Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now! [Bebe rolls her eyes and sighs] All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
Bebe
Stan, why don't you show her you love her? If you really want Wendy back, try doing the most romantic thing you can think of.
Stan
[thinks] Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
Bebe
If you really want a shot at getting her back, stand outside her window, hold a boombox over your head, and play [closes her eyes] Peter Gabriel.
Wendy's house, night. Stan stands on the lawn with a boombox, looking up at Wendy's window. He presses the play button and holds up the boombox. Peter Gabriel's "Shock the Monkey" plays from somewhere in the middle. Wendy appears at the window and looks down, her jaw dropping. Stan holds the boombox higher, keeping Wendy's gaze on him. Wendy covers her mouth as Token appears next to her at the window. Stan's jaw drops. Wendy leaves the window. Token unleashes the curtain ties, and the curtains close upon the window
Raisins, night, outside. The outside lights turn off. Butters waits outside on the curb with a present. The front door opens and Lexus appears. Butters rises to greet her
Lexus
Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow. Bye, Mercedes.
Butters
[approaches] Lexus! [she takes a few steps back]
Lexus
Uh oh. Uh, hi, sweetie.
Butters
I waited all night for you to get off work.
Lexus
Oh, really? [takes a few more steps back] Huhunh, that's great. Uhm, Maury...
Butters
I I just could- I just couldn't stop thinking about you.
Maury
[a huge bouncer] There a problem?
Lexus
Could you uh just help walk me to my- bike?
Maury
Right. [steps up behind her and shoves Butters aside. He keeps his arm in place so Butters doesn't get any closer to Lexus]
Lexus
[to Butters] Thanks again for the big tip. You are such a sweetie. Come back and see me real soon, okay? [moves forward, with Maury close behind]
Butters
Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
Lexus
[stops and grabs it] Oh wow. Thanks, cutie.
Butters
It's a little stuffed bear dressed as a rabbit. [tries to get closer, but Maury holds him back]
Lexus
Gosh, that's the nicest gift I've gotten all night. Thank you. [reaches her bike] Well I gotta go, honey. Be sure to come back to Raisins and see me again, okaaay? [unlocks her bike from its post]
Butters
[tries to get closer, but Maury him back] Well yeah, but, but, hey, [tries to get closer, but Maury him back] hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
Lexus
Oh gee, that would be great, honey, but I'm reeeally busy this week. Tell you what: you come back to Raisins and then we'll be able to hang out all we want, okay? [Maury helps her on to her bike]
Butters
O-kay!
Lexus
Bye, cutie!
Butters
Bye, bye darling! [Maury turns and goes back to the restaurant. Butters holds his hands over his heart] Wow... a real-life relationship.
[South Park Elementary, day. All the boys are in various stages of dress. Most of them are in their P.E. uniforms.]
Mr. Garrison
[sternly] All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. [the boys break up and head to their lockers. Stan remains on a bench on his back, alone, with just a towel and his hat on]
Kyle
[returns] Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.
Stan
[with emotion in his voice] I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
Kyle
Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
Stan
There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
Kyle
Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
Stan
Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
South Park Elementary, loading bay. Stan finds the goth kids.
Pete
[with black puffy, feathery hair, streaked in red] Life is pain. Life is only pain. [his hair falls over his right eye, he jerks his head back to put it back in place] We're all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back] But there's only blackness. Dark, depressing loneliness that [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back] eats at your soul.
Michael
[dressed in something like a tuxedo, sporting a curly pompadour] Who needs that kind of Barbie love, anyway? Everyone's just walking around like a bunch of conformists. Go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium. They're all zombies racing to their graves. Love didn't work for my mom and dad. Why should it work for me?
Henrietta
My dad is such an asshole. Drunken bastard doesn't even know I exist. But then he won't let me go to the Skinny Puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner. [takes a puff] Dinner? That's a laugh. Just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the Britney Spears wannabes at this school.
Firkle
They're all a bunch of Nazi conformists cheerleaders. [Stan looks stunned at the age of this youngest of Goths]
Stan
But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
Pete
Just to make life more miserable for the conformists. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back]
Stan
All right, so how do I join you?
Michael
If you wanna be one of the non-conformists, all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do.
Stan
...'K.
Raisins, day. Raisins is preparing for a new day of food and fun. Mercedes escorts a new employee around
Mercedes
Okay, I know it's your first day, Ferrari, so I wanna go over the basics with you.
Ferrari
Okay.
Mercedes
First of all, there's a five foot rule. If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they're not at your table. "Hey, cutie." [waves and winks] When you're not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun. [they stop by a wooden bucket] We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins. [they leave the bucket] Now, when you take a customer's order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you're interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. "Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in." If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. "I'll be right back with your order, guys." [holds Ferrari's shoulder]
Ferrari
Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes.
Mercedes
Okay. Well, I guess we're ready to open for business. Good luck. [Ferrari walks off] Go ahead and open for business, Porsche!
Porsche
Okay! [opens the doors and Butters bolts in, quite excitedly]
Raisins Girl
Hi, welcome to Raisins!
Butters
Hi! Is Lexus here?
Lexus
Hey, cutie.
Butters
Darling!
Lexus
[hugs him] How are we doing today?
Butters
[hugs back] Oh God. I missed you so much.
Henrietta's room. It's quite the room, with posters for Skippy Puppy and the Nothing Matters tour, a Blauhaus poster, candles all around, a mace on the floor, cigarettes next to a book, an ornate candelabrum and chair, and a darkened atmosphere.
Henrietta
[Reciting her poem]
Shallow life.
Drowning alone, I gasp for air.
Coldness creeps over pale skin.
There is sadness so deep it pulls me down
Happiness dies in a deep, dark sea.

Pete
Yeah, happiness dies. [his hair falls over his eye, he jerks his head back]
Stan
[dressed all in black, with a black hat with puffball] Yeah.
Michael
All right, your turn, Stan. Read one of your poems about pain.
Stan
[takes up his paper and reads his poem]
There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.

Henrietta
Whoa.
Stan
[continues]
The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-

Pete
Whoa, whoa! Dude! Those last two lines aren't Goth!
Stan
They're not?
Michael
No, dude! You can't say "I miss you so much, babe. I want to hold you in my arms."
Henrietta
Make it "I miss seeing you so much I wanna slash my eyes out with razor blades."
Henrietta's Mom
[the bedroom door opens and a blindingly invasive amount of light comes in, she looks inside] Henrietta! Hi sweetie!
Henrietta
Go away Mom! Leave me alone!
Henrietta's Mom
Daddy and I just got your birthday present! But you can't see what it is till tomorrow!
Henrietta
You'd like to wait till I was dead, wouldn't you? You'd like to see maggots eat my face.
Henrietta's Mom
Ee-you are so creative, honey.
Henrietta
Conformist bitch.
Other Goths
Yeah.
Raisins, day. Two of the Raisins girls are entertaining the child customers, who respond enthusiastically. The phone rings and Porsche arrives to answer it.
Porsche
Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Porsche. Have you tried our Double Whammy Wings?
Butters
[seated on his bed in his room. A picture of Lexus is taped to his wall next to the window. The action switches back and forth] Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. [Lexus happens to walk by, and Porsche hands her the phone.]
Lexus
Thanks for calling Raisins. This is Lexus.
Butters
Hey Lexus.
Lexus
Hi, sweetie! Who's this?
Butters
Wuh it's me, Butters.
Lexus
Oh, okay. Hi, cutie. [keeps an eye out for passing customers. Three boys walk by and she covers the phone's receiver] Hey sweetie. [lifts her hand from the receiver] So how are you, honey?
Butters
I'm fine. I miss you though. [lays on his back, getting comfortable] Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz. [shot of Lexus pouring lemonade into a pitcher] Sometimes I think our classes are too hard. [back to Butters' room] But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
Lexus
Good, good.
Butters
Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
Lexus
Oh, gee, I don't know, cutie. [another Raisins girl comes with glasses to refill, Lexus ] Why don't you just come down to Raisins?
Butters
Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
Lexus
[waving to customers] Awww, that's too bad, cutie. I really wanna see you.
Butters
Oh, I really wanna see you too, baby. Eh don't, don't worry. I'll get more money
Lexus
[walks to the phone's base to end the conversation] 'K sugar. Gotta run.
Butters
Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say. [Lexus has hung up and is walking away with her pitcher] Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you. [hangs up quickly and nervously] Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
Butters' house, living room. Butters arrives there moments later and faces the couch
Butters
Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
Stephen
O-hoo no Butters! You got an advance two days ago. [Linda is dusting off the family portrait by the front door.]
Butters
Uh but I spent it all.
Linda
What are you spending all that money on, Butters?
Butters
On my girlfriend.
Stephen
[he and Linda are surprised] Girlfriend?
Linda
You... have a girlfriend, Butters?
Butters
[bashfully, puts his hands behind his back] Yeah.
Chris
And she's... a... girl, right?
Butters
Yup!
Chris
Well all right! Good for you, Butters!
Linda
Oh, that is so cute. When do we get to meet her?
Butters
Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone. [holds a cautionary finger] But don't embarrass me or nothin'. [lowers it] I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
Stephen
Don't worry, Butters. We just wanna say hi and then we'll leave you two alone.
Butters
Okay. [walks off]
Stephen
[holds out his hand] You see? I told you he wouldn't turn out gay.
Linda
[hands him a bill] All right, you win.
Benny's, night. "We're always open." The Goth kids are seated at a booth drinking coffee. A middle-aged waitress walks by with a pot of coffee
Michael
Hey, can we get more coffee over here?
Waitress
Damn it, are you kids just gonna sit here all night again and drink six dollars' work of coffee?! Why don't you get a life?! [walks away]
Michael
[bitterly] Conformist. Have fun in your rat-race life, living paycheck to paycheck for corporate gains.
Other Goths
Yeah.
Pete
[to Stan] Dude, you haven't drank your coffee. [his hair falls over his face, he jerks his head back]
Stan
Well I don't drink coffee.
Pete
You can't be a non-conformist if you don't drink coffee. [Stan picks up his mug and drinks. Kyle enters the restaurant and approaches Stan's booth]
Kyle
Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
Stan
[sips some coffee] Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. [sips some coffee. Pete jerks his hair back into place]
Kyle
God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
Stan
So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
Pete
Yeah. Why don't you just go back to your Justin Timberlake and your homework, you conformist asshole? [jerks his hair back into place] You just don't know what real pain is.
Kyle
Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
Pete
I'm not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.
Kyle
Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
Stan
What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
Kyle
Yeah. She is.
Stan
Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
Henrietta
For sure.
Kyle
[walks away, defeated] Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
Stan
[sips some coffee] ...conformist.
Other Goths
Yeah.
Raisins, night. Butters and his parents arrive.
Butters
Here we are, Mom and Dad! [they enter, but his parents are immediately troubled by the setting]
Mercedes
Hi, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
Butters
Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
Mercedes
Great. [gets some menus] Be sure to try our Cheddar Poppers. Right this way. [leads them to a table]
Raisins Girl
Who else wants a signed Raisins Girls calendar for five dollars? [the table she approaches cheers]
Diners
Woohoo, all right, yeah! [the Stotches look around, amazed]
Linda
Stephen, what is this place?
Stephen
I, don't know.
Mercedes
[stops at a table] Here you go. Porsche will by right with you. [walks off]
Butters
Go ahead and have a seat, guys. Ah I've gotta go and find Lexus! [runs off. Stephen and Linda take their seats]
Raisins Girl
[blonde, to a boy at a table nearby] Hey cutie, you having a good time?
Boy
Yeah.
Stephen
Oh boy, I think I know what's happened. Our son hasn't learned yet that girls will pretend to like him for money.
Linda
[holds her hands together] This place is horrible. To objectify girls like this.
Porsche
[arrives] Hi guys. Can I take your order?
Linda
Little girl, you shouldn't be working here.
Porsche
I shouldn't? Where I supposed to be working?
Linda
No, I mean you shouldn't work somewhere where you're paid for how you look. You should be learning a skill so you can grow up to be a businesswoman or even a doctor. Who knows? You could cure cancer.
Porsche
I could cure cancer? Omigod! That would be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.
Linda
... Oh. Never mind, I think Raisins might be the perfect place for you.
Porsche
Cool! [grins and hops off the stool, then carries it off. Butters arrives with Lexus, who carries a plate of chips]
Butters
Mom? Dad? This is Lexus.
Lexus
Hi. Welcome to Raisins.
Stephen
Uh, Butters, can we have a little talk with you? Outside?
Butters
Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me [holds on to Lexus] you can say in front of Lexus.
Linda
Butters, these girls pretend to be interested in you because they know you'll give them tips.
Butters
Huh?
Stephen
You see, Butters, women know that they can make men do anything by flirting. And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.
Butters
Oh, I see. [gets angry] You don't approve of my girlfriend! [Lexus looks off and smiles at somebody] Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad! [walks away from the table with Lexus] Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
Lexus
What are you talking about, kid? We are NOT boyfriend and girlfriend.
Butters
... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
Lexus
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Butters
So that's it? We're broken up now?
Lexus
I gotta get these curly fries to Table 12. [walks off]
Butters
Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over. [walks off dejected] Our relationship is o-over.
Stan did, at the curb under a working street light. Some shadows move in on him and stop when they cover most of his head
Michael
Look at that. Another tortured soul.
Pete
Another life of pain. [Butters looks up to see the Goths. Stan isn't shown yet.]
Michael
Hey Raven, check it out. [Stan, now named Raven, enters the picture]
Stan
Butters?
Butters
Oh [sniff, wipes away his tears] Uh hey, hey Stan.
Stan
What's the matter with you?
Butters
[sobbing] Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
Henrietta
Did she step on your heart with stiletto heels?
Butters
Yeah. [sniff] It sure does hurt.
Michael
That's cool. I guess you can join up with us if you want.
Pete
Yeah. We're gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.
Butters
Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
Stan
Huh? But you just got dumped.
Butters
Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like, [sobs] it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
Pete
Yeah.
Stan
No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
Butters
Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. [walks off]
Stan
He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. [walks off]
Michael
Go ahead and go back to your sunshine fairytale!
South Park Elementary, playground. The school kids are back at play. The same two teams face off, except that Bill has replaced Token on Stan's
team, and Stan hasn't arrived yet

Kyle
[prepares to receive the football] Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
Stan
[arrives] Hey, can I join in? [the other boys turn around]
Kyle
What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
Stan
Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way. [Token and Wendy walk by at this point] Hey Wendy! [Token and Wendy look] You're a bitch,.. Token? [flips him off] Right here, buddy. [Token and Wendy walk off, insulted]
Kyle
Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
Stan
Yeah. Let's play ball.
End of Raisins

It's Christmas in Canada
Kyle's house, night. "Happy Chanukah" The Broflovski family sings as Gerald lights the first candle on the Chanukah menorah.
The Broflovskis
Chanukah, Chanukah, sivivon, sov, sov
Ike
I gotta go tinkle.
Kyle
No Ike! Shh!
The Broflovskis
[while Ike and Kyle talk] Sov, sov, sov! Sov, sov, sov! Ma nayim vi-tov.
Gerald
We thank God for our blessings this Chanukah. Our little family is so loving, and perfect, and nothing will ever tear us apart. [the doorbell rings] I'll get it. [goes to answer the door. A Canadian couple stands at the entrance]
Man
Gerald Broflovski?
Gerald
Yes?
Man
My name is Harry Gintz and this is my wife Elise. We're from Canada.
Gerald
Yes, I can tell.
Harry
My wife and I had a child a few years back, and, we weren't ready to have a child, so we put him up for adoption. [Kyle and Ike come into view] We were told that you might be the-
Elise
Peter! [rushes in] Oh God, Harry! It's our son! [approaches and kneels. Ike hides behind Kyle] Peter, it's Mommy.
Sheila
Gerald, what the hell is going on?
Gerald
I'm not sure.
Moments later, both couples are at the dining room table.
Harry
It was a tough time for us. It was a tough time for all of Canada. The whole country was devastated by the cola wars. It just seemed we couldn't take care of a baby.
Elise
So we put him up for adoption. But as the years passed, I, I just felt an emptiness in my heart. [Kyle eavesdrops on the conversation, with Ike at his side] Oh it's so good to see him.
Sheila
Well we wish you all the best, Mr. and Mrs. Gintz, but to be honest, I think it would be best for Ike if you didn't come around again.
Elise
I don't think you understand. We didn't come to visit Peter, we came to take him back.
Gerald
What?
Harry
We want to take Peter home, to Canada.
Sheila
Are you crazy?!
Gerald
Look, you gave Ike up. You can't just change your mind.
Harry
Changing your mind is a Canadian custom that we hold quite dear. And besides, the new Canadian Prime Minister has issued a decree that all adopted Canadians must be returned home.
Sheila
The new Canadian Prime Minister?
Gerald
Look, Ike is our son now!
Harry
He doesn't belong here. He belongs in Canada with his own kind.
Sheila
I think you'd better leave.
Harry
Please, don't make things any harder for Peter.
Gerald
Harder for Peter?! Now you two just blow in here and say you're gonna haul him back to Canada, and we're being hard on Peter?!
Harry
We're prepared to go to court! We had hoped it wouldn't come to that!
Gerald
Well you bet your ass it'll come to that!
Park County courtroom, day.
Judge
I'm sorry to say that my hands are tied. The new Prime Minister of Canada has authority this court cannot override. By Canadian law I must award custody of the child to his birth parents.
The Gintzes
Yes!
Elise
Yes!
Sheila
No!
Kyle
[frightened] Ike's not my little brother anymore?
Sheila
Gerald, do something!
Gerald
There's nothing I can do.
Kyle's house, day. Sheila cries as Gerald sends Ike off.
Gerald
Good-bye, Ike. You... [wipes a tear from his eyes] be a good boy, huh? You... remember all the things we taught you. [kisses Ike on the head and steps back to console Sheila. Kyle steps forward.]
Kyle
Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
Harry
Come on, Peter, we should get going.
Ike
[holds onto Kyle] No!
Elise
Peter, you must come with Mommy and Daddy.
Ike
No no no no no!
Harry
[whips out a chocolate bar] I have some chocolate.
Ike
Chocolate! [rushes for the candy, and Harry settles him inside the car]
Harry
We're going to take good care of him.
Kyle
You'd better! [Harry closes the car door and goes to his side, then settles in to drive. The car lunges forward on square wheels. Kyle looks as Ike goes away. Ike looks back] Dad, can't we talk to this new Canadian Prime Minister? If he knew the situation, he might be-
Gerald
Oh! Kyle, appealing to the Prime Minister of Canada would take... time and money we don't have.
Luau's Toys, night. It's dressed for Christmas. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny look inside the shop through the window.
Cartman
Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
Stan
Dude, I'm gonna tell my parents to get me that John Elway doll with the karate-chop action.
Kyle
Guys. [the other boys turn to face him] Guys, I need your help.
Stan
Sure dude.
Kyle
It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
Cartman
We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
Stan
Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
Kyle
Please, you guys, you don't understand. [walks off some distance] My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
Cartman
Well, I didn't wanna say anything, Kyle, but I think this is what your family gets for being Jewish at Christmas time.
Stan
Dude, Cartman.
Cartman
I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
Kyle
[returns] I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
Stan
Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. [he, Cartman and Kenny leave. Cartman stops and returns]
Cartman
Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. [walks off in the direction of the other boys. Kyle walks off sadly in the other direction]
South Park City Hall, night. The town Christmas tree is up, City Hall is decked out in Christmas decorations.
Crowd
Three! Two! One! [The lights to the Christmas tree are plugged in] Yaaaaay!
Mayor McDaniels
As we celebrate this glorious time, we can't forget those families who are suffering. As many of you know, the Broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them. As a community, we must do all we can to ease their pain. Are there any suggestions how we might help?
Mr. Garrison
How about, we get rid of all the Mexicans? [a few seconds of silence]
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, every Christmas you suggest we get rid of all the Mexicans, and every Christmas we tell you "NO!"
Mr. Garrison
Rats!
Chef
The Broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new Canadian Prime Minister. What if this Christmas, instead of buyin' presents, we all use that money to give to the Broflovskis?
Cartman
HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
Liane
That's a great idea, Chef.
Cartman
What?
Randy
Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
Stan
[trying to rein in his dad's enthusiasm] Dad, don't get carried away.
Mayor McDaniels
Then it's settled: This year we'll give all our Christmas money to the Broflovskis, in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them. [the crowd cheers and disperses]
Cartman
No! No, this can't be happening! [Kenny, Heidi and Clyde remain there as well. Clyde begins to cry.]
Kyle walks down the street still depressed. Cartman bounds in before him.
Cartman
You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!! [Stan and Kenny walk in behind him] You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!! [lunges after Kyle] AAAAAA!! [Stan and Kenny jump in and hold him back]
Stan
Whoa whoa, Cartman.
Cartman
It wasn't enough for you people to kill Jesus, now you have to kill Christmas too, huh?!
Stan
Cartman, calm down!
Kyle
[to Stan] Is that true?
Stan
It's true, dude. Christmas is ruined.
Cartman
[takes off his mittens and coat] This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
Kyle
I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
Cartman
You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
Kyle
It's worth a shot. Come on, you guys, we can do this.
Stan
Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
Kyle
[reassuring] We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
Cartman
Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
City Wok, night. "Christmas Special: Chinese Food For The Holidays" Mr. Kim sits at one of his tables with nothing to do.
Mr. Kim
No business... Christmas time come and nobody wanna eat Chinese food. Looks like I might as well close. [a phone rings. He perks up and runs to get it] Oh boy! Some business! [puts on his chef hat and grabs a notepad] Finally! [grabs the phone and waits for the order] Herro? Shitty Wok, take ur orda prease!
Kyle
Uh, I must have the wrong number. We were trying to reach City Airlines.
Mr. Kim
Oh, oh yes, just a moment prease. [flips a sign over so it now reads "City Airlines" and switches to a captain's hat] Herro, Shitty Airrines. Can I help you take ur orda prease?
Kyle
Uh, we need to go to Canada. As soon as possible.
Mr. Kim
Oooh, Canada. Okay, that's uh pretty far. Gonna cost ya a lot of money... hmm let's see. How many people?
Kyle
Four.
Mr. Kim
Okay. Four people, Canada, cost a lot of money, that uh gonna be about ah six thousand five hundred dolla.
Kyle
How about fifty daura?
Mr. Kim
Fifty daura?! You flight to Canada cost at least three thousand dollar!
Kyle
Fifty-five daura.
Mr. Kim
Hey! Stop wasting my time with fifty-five daura! No way I take my plane to Canada for less than a thousand daura!
Kyle
Okay. Sixty daura.
Mr. Kim
Sixty-two daura.
Kyle
Okay.
Mr. Kim
Okay. Meet me Park County Airfield, yellow Cessna, tail number 432G.
Kyle
Got it. [hangs up]
Mr. Kim
[hangs up, then giggles] Hehehehe, never try to barter with a Chinese man.
Park County Airfield, night. A plane comes in for a landing in the background as the boys approach the yellow Cessna.
Cartman
We have exactly fifty-two hours before Christmas. [this sets it at 8 p.m. December 22] That means we have to be back in twenty-eight hours to still give our patents twenty-four hours to buy us presents. Synchronize watches on my mark. Mark.
Mr. Kim
Herro, welcome Shitty Airrine. [Stan and Kyle move ahead. Kenny stays with Cartman]
Cartman
[shakes his head vigorously] Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
Kenny
(Me neither!)
Kyle
Why not?
Kenny
('Cause, dude, I'll fuckin' die!)
Kyle
You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
Cartman
You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
Stan
No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
Cartman
Of course I care about Christmas- oh, Christ on a stick! [he and Kenny head for the plane]
Cessna 432G, inside.
Cartman
Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
Mr. Kim
Okay, welcome aboard Shitty Airrines. This is your captain speaking. Looking about a two hour fright. I'll be turning on the seatbelt sign now. If your seats have seatbelts, this is the time you will fasten them. Please sit back, relax, and enjoy your Shitty fright. [he turns off the intercom and takes flight after a small bump.]
Kyle
All right! We're going to Canada!
Cartman
Sweet.
Cessna 432G, day. The flight has taken longer than two hours. The boys are sleeping in their seats - and so is Mr. Kim. The plane begins to hit turbulence and lose power.
Mr. Kim
Hey, turn off the right. ...Wha- oh! [a sudden noisy dip awakens the boys]
Stan
What's going on??
Mr. Kim
Herro from the cockpit, this is your captain speaking. As you can see, it appears that we are goin' down. Now would be a good time to reflect on your rife, and pray to whatever deity you believe in. Thank you for flying Shitty Airlines. We know you have a choice in airlines, and it looks like you made the wrong one. [quickly puts on a parachute and opens his door to drop away]
Kyle
Hey, where the hell are you going?? [Mr. Kim jumps out and away. A few seconds later he pulls the rip cord and the parachute comes out]
Stan
Do something, Kyle! [Kyle grabs the controls and tries to steer the plane]
Kyle
I'm trying! [the plane bounces around in the air]
Cartman
Look out!
Kenny
(N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!) [the plane makes a steep descent and crashes onto the ground. It flips over and crumples up, resting near a town. The boys scramble out of the rubble and walk into the town]
Now begins the "Wizard of Oz" sequence. The boys look around in wonder. A pair of legs is seen at a bench, but no head is shown.
Stan
You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. [As they look in one direction, four Canadians pop up from some bushes and look at them. They drop back into the bushes before the boys turn back around]
Canadian Man
Excuse me? [a head pops up over the legs at the bench] Uh, is this an invasion?
Kyle
No.
Canadian Man
[a doctor, it seems] Oh thank heavens! It's okay. Everyone, it's not an invasion! [people come out of their hiding places. A man pops up out of a manhole mumbling something as the others mill around]
Kyle
Hey! We're in Canada!
Doctor
Well of course you are! And Canada Friends welcomes you!
Canadians
Welcome, friend, to Canada! Canada Friends loves you!
We're just like any other country without the big tattoo!
Sailor
[walks up] We greet thee with pleasure, but one question, if we may?
Businessman
[walks up and joins him] What brings you folks to Canada? Why are you here today?
Kyle
Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
Canadians
His brother is our quest. The question is, is what? You must talk to the new Prime Minister if you think his brother's home's back there.
Cartman
Oh Jesus Christ.
Scott
[shows up] Hey! What the hell is going on?!
Canadians
It's Scott! AAAAHHHH! [they all take off in different directions]
Scott
Who damaged our beloved Canadian land?!
Kyle
Who's that?
Doctor
That's Scott! He's a dick
Scott
[fixes his gaze on the boys and approaches] A-ha! Americans! I should've known! You think you're the police of the world! You think you own Canada! Well, you aren't welcome here! Get out now!
Doctor
Oh no you don't, Scott! Leave these boys alone!
Scott
This isn't over, you American scum! I swear to God: you'll rue this day!! [walks off]
Man in Barrel
God, what a dick!
Kyle
Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
Doctor
The new Prime Minister doesn't live in this part of Canada. He's in Ottawa. [the other Canadians concur]
Kyle
So how do we get to Ottawa?
Wrestler
Oh that's easy. You just have to follow the road.
Cartman
Which road?!
Firefighter
This is Canada. We only have one road. [he moves to one side and the crowd splits in two to allow the boys through]
Priest
Follow the only road.
Man
Follow the only road.
Canadians
To go anywhere in Canada, you just follow the only road.
There's only one road in Canada. We call it the Road, the only road.
Hip-hip, hooray, let's hear it for our Road.

Road Workers
And it's paved and wide and up to code.
Stan
All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
Kyle
Word!
Canadians
You're off to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
Doctor
Good-bye, friends! Good luck with the new Prime Minister! And remember to watch out for Scott! He's a dick!
Canadians
Good-bye, good-bye, see ya, good luck.
The Road, day.
Cartman
[checking his watch] Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. [a mountie appears]
Mountie
Ahoy there, travelers.
Kyle
Who are you?
Mountie
I am Rick, the proud Canadian Mountie. [he's shown riding a sheep]
Sheep
Baaaah.
Stan
I thought mounties were supposed to ride horses.
Rick
[hangs his head a bit] Yes. Yes, we are. But our funding has been cut and now we're forced to ride...
Sheep
Baaaah.
Cartman
But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
Rick
You're going to see the new Prime Minister. Oh, I would so like to meet him myself. It's his strange new laws that took our horses away. Perhaps I will go with you.
Kyle
That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
Rick
Follow me this way! We're going to see the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of Canada!
Scott
[monitoring their progress over remote cameras] Power-hungry Americans! I'll fix you!
Further down the Road, Rick and the boys pass through another town.
Cartman
Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
Rick
All right boys, prepare yourselves. We're about to enter... French Canada.
Kyle
French Canada?
French Canadians
[Before them, lots of French Canadians cavort like it's Euro Disney, with circus performers of all stripes doing what they do best.]
There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.
Ze ozer Canada is hardly Canada. If you lived here for a day, you'd understand.

Mime
Honh honh honnnh! Welcome to French Canada.
Hockey Player
We have everything your heart could desire. Trapezes. Trampolines. And lots and lots of cheese.
Artist
[takes off his mustache] Would you like a moustache?
Rick
Just stay calm, boys. French Canadians are a little... odd. [behind them, two of them walk by. One is dressed in blue and looks a bit like an alien. The other is dressed something like He-Man, with long flowing locks.]
Stan
Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
Mime
Well first you must answer that phone. [makes his left hand into a phone receiver] Ring-ring. Ring-ring.
Kyle
We don't have time for this.
Mime
You cannot pass through French Canada unless you take zat phone call! [holds out his "phone"] Ring-ring. Ring-ring. [Kyle responds by make his right hand into a phone and answering]
Kyle
Hello?
Mime
Allo. If you are going to see za new Prime Minister, then I want to go with you. He has passed a new law forbidding us French Canadians to drink wine.
Artist
[walks up to the boys] How can ze French not drink wine?? Travestie!
Kyle
Okay, you can come with us.
Mime
Honh honnnh! Very good! Let us make haste!
French Canadians
[they escort the boys out and on their way with the Mime and the Mountie]
There'z no Canada like French Canada, it'z za bezt Canada in ze land.
And ze ozer Canada.

Mime
Is a bullshit Canada
French Canadians
If you lived here for a day, you'd understand. [the small group leaves the town behind]
Mime
I think you'd understand. ...You understand.
Newfoundland. The group arrives at a dark place.
Rick
Oh my! This certainly is a desolate place!
Mime
It reminds me of death and fear.
Cartman
How much further to Ottawa?! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
Rick
We must be very close now.
Scott
[jumps out in front of them] Ey! What are you doing?!
Rick
Waaaah!
Mime
Oh no. It's Scott.
Scott
What are you two doing helping these Americans?! Don't you know America thinks it owns Canada along with the rest of the world?!
Rick
You're a dick, Scott!
Scott
You're a dick! And by helping Americans, you're just as smelly as they are! Now I'm going to get you!
Fisherman
[exits a house with a fish in his left hand and a pole in his right] Not so fast, Scott!
Scott
Who the hell are you?!
Fisherman
I'm Steve the Newfoudlander. And you're on Newfoundland property now! Get off before I have you arrested!
Scott
Ugh! This isn't over! Not by a long shot! I'll fix you. I'll fix all of you!! [leaves in a huff. Steve draws closer to the group]
Rick
Woo, that was a close call. Thank you, kind Newfie!
Kyle
God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
Steve
Oh yeah, the Prime Minister, eh? He sure has screwed up things for Newfoundland. Life just hasn't been the same since he made sodomy illegal.
Mime
Well, come with us! Maybe you can ask him to take his sodomy ban away.
Kyle
Can we just get going, please?
Steve
Yeah, sure, except there's just one problem.
Stan
What?
Steve
You folks are goin' the wrong way.
Stan
What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
Steve
Yeah. And you all went the wrong direction on it.
Rick
Ohh, that's right. Ottawa is that way. [points behind the group]
Mime
Of course. Ottawa left, Newfoundland right!
Stan
[grimacing] Oh no!
Cartman
[glaring at Rick] How could you be so stupid!
Kyle
There's no way we can go all the way back. We'll never make it now!
Rick
It's okay, boys. The power is inside us to get to Ottawa! We can wish ourselves there!
Mime
Ah yes, let's wish ourselves there. [the three Canadians close their eyes and wish real hard]
Rick
[peeks with his left eye] Is it working?
Cartman
Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down! [puts up his fists] Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! [grabs Kyle by the collar]
Steve
[now in his boat at the end of a dock] Of course, we could always take my boat, eh?
Rick
Oh yes! On the river we could travel to Ottawa in no time!
Kyle
Well come on! [everyone hops into the boat]
Steve
Okay, next stop, the new Prime Minister. [the boat leaves the dock and goes on its way]
Kyle
Do you think we can still make it in time?
Cartman
We'd better, Kyle. Or you're dead.
The Parliament building, dawn. Steve and the rest of the party pull up to the small dock at one end of the grounds.
Steve
Here we are at the Parliament buildin'.
Mime
Ze Prime Minister is inside.
Cartman
[hops off the boat and runs towards Parliament] Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! [the rest of the group follows]
The Parliament building, entrance. Kyle knocks on the heavy wooden doors. A wooden panel opens up to reveal a window. A doorman looks out through it.
Doorman
Yes?
Kyle
We need to see the new Prime Minister.
Doorman
Ha! Impossible! The new Prime Minister isn't seeing anybody! [slams the window shut]
Mime
Oh well, so much for zat. [turns around and slowly walks away]
Steve
Yeah, we gave it our best, but our best wasn't good enough, eh? [joins the Mime]
Kyle
No. No!! [knocks on the door again. Steve and the Mime turn around]
Doorman
[opens his window again] Yes?
Kyle
Please, sir. I traveled a long way to get here. He's the only person who can help me.
Doorman
[a big smug] The Prime Minister isn't here. He's in China on official business. So you might as well go home. Good-bye!
Kyle
[turns around and walks off slowly] Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. [sits down on the steps farther away from the door]
Cartman
And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. [sits on the steps]
Stan
And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. [sits between the two of them]
Kenny
(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) [his voice trails off and he joins the others on the steps. They all cry]
Doorman
[begins to cry with the boys] Oh please! Please stop crying.
Cartman
[through his tears] I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.
Doorman
All right all right, I was lying. The Prime Minister IS here.
Kyle
[turns around] Really? [the boys stand and approach the doors]
Doorman
Yes yes. Come in. [opens the large wooden doors, and the group enters.]
The Parliament building, inside. The group walks down a long hallway and approach a large sanctum with three fire pits. Two small ones burn before and on each side of the huge one, which sits at the center and has a holograph of the Prime Minister hovering over it
Prime Minister
I am the Prime Minister of Canada. What do you guys want?
Kyle
[after a few moments, steps forth] Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
Scott
Not so fast! [soon appears with the Gintses]
Kyle
Ike!
Ike
Kyle!
Scott
Prime Minister, these are the child's Canadian parents! Their Canadian blood pumps through his veins! Would you send him back to America with those world-hungry scum?!
Kyle
Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. [Harry and Elise look at each other]
Prime Minister
That is a great speech, guy. But the answer is no! All of my new laws will stay in effect forever!
Scott
Haha, you lose, Americans!
Rick
Then, I suppose us mounties will never get our horses.
Mime
And we won't get our wine.
Steve
And we can't perform sodomy, eh?
Kyle
But why are you making such strange laws??
Prime Minister
I SAID GO! [a blast from his holographic eyes incinerates Kenny]
Kenny
(Aah!)
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle
[walks over to the charred remains] You... bastards! [brushes off a bit of Kenny from his jacket] Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred? [Stan dusts himself off] And, and takes away mounties' horses? [Stan notices a purple curtain nearby and walks over to it] And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
Prime Minister
I am the Prime Minister of Canada. [as he says this, Stan pulls the curtain back and Saddam Hussein appears behind it, cramped behind a console] I can do whatever I- [notices his cover is blown] Uh oh. Uh, don't mind that guy hiding in the spider hole, he's just my friend.
Kyle
[the other members of the group gather in, as well as other people nearby] What the hell??
Rick
Hey, that looks like Saddam Hussein!
Saddam Hussein
Saddam Hussein?? Naw, relax, buddah. I'm not him.
Mime
Zat explains everything! Za new Prime Minister was Saddam Hussein, once again trying to take over our beloved Canada like he did before.
Soldier 1
Saddam Hussein?
Soldier 2
He was fooling us?
Businessman
Get him! [the soldiers quickly seize him and haul him away]
Saddam Hussein
Ahh, don't shoot. I want to negotiate. Hey, relax! [the crowd pounces on him and tear him apart] Gah!
Rick
Wait a minute. This means all the Prime Minister's new laws are null and void. We can have our horses back!
Mime
And we can drink our wine.
Steve
And I can sodomize me boys again
Harry
[brings Ike over to Kyle] Young man, you... must really care for Peter to have come all this way.
Elise
Perhaps we were wrong to try and take Peter back. He doesn't belong here. He belongs with his family.
Harry
[gently drops Ike to the floor] Peter, would you like to go back to your home in Colorado? [Ike walks over to Kyle and hugs him. Kyle returns the hug, and the Gintses hug as well, looking at the bond between Kyle and Ike. An alarm goes off. Cartman looks at his watch]
Stan
What is that?
Cartman
It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
Kyle
Well yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
Cartman
Yeah! You got your brother back, but I didn't get any presents! [takes off his mittens] And what did I tell you, Kyle?! [unbuttons his jacket, takes it off, and bunches it up] I told you that if we didn't make it back in time for Christmas I was gonna whup your ass, didn't I?! [tosses his jacket away]
Kyle
Dude, come on.
Cartman
Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now! [puts up his fists] We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!! [Kyle puts up his fists and gives Cartman a quick right hook across the face. Cartman blinks a few times and begins to bawl] Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
Rick
Hey, come on, boys! You can spend Christmas with us, Canada style!
Ottawa, day. A Christmas parade goes by and the crowds cheer and throw confetti. Saddam is paraded on his own float, with huge candy canes around him.
Canadians
Ding dong, they caught Saddam! Merry Christmas to the world!
Ding dong, the Americans caught Saddam!
[Santa's sleigh passes by and the boys are hoisted into it]
Now Canada is free for you and you and me
It's the best Christmas presents we ever got
Canadian Christmas, it's the best! We drink and dance and show our breasts!
Let's celebrate! Saddam Hussein's been caught!

Stan
[sighs] Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. [Cartman holds a towel over his left nostril, which is bleeding]
End of It's Christmas in Canada


Good Times with Weapons
Park County Fair, day. South Park is more spread out these days. Looking like a small city now. People mill around. The boys walk along a fairway. Cartman pulls out a small firecracker and tosses it on the ground before Kyle and cackles softlyv
Kyle
[stops so he doesn't get hurt and glares] Stop it, Cartman!
Cartman
Pfaha, so funny. [pulls out another firecracker, tosses it before Kyle, and cackles]
Kyle
[stops] Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! [Cartman cackles some more. The boys approach a booth: Roger's Edge]
Roger
Come on and take a look, folks. We've got a lot of knives for sale here. [Stan stops before a table, "Weapons of Asia," and marvels at the weapons displayed there.]
Stan
Oh my God, look! [the other boys turn and walk up] Martial arts weapons from the Far East. [the sign reads "Martial arts weapons of the Far East"]
Kyle
[softly] Wow, cool.
Stan
Dude! We should each buy a weapon, and then we'll be like ninjas.
Cartman
Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
Kyle
[turns away] Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. [the others turn as well]
Cartman
Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
Stan
Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought. [the boys turn back to face the table] I'll get the tonfas. [they look like the nightsticks police use, but made of wood] Those are so sweet.
Cartman
I'm gonna get those killer sai. [swords with horns at the hilt are in there. Cartman notices a weapon off to the right] Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken [ninja star] for a dollar ninety nine.
Kenny
(Shuriken. Awesome!)
Roger
[approaches] Can I help you boys? [the boys step back from the table to see him.]
Stan
Yeah. We wanna get one of each of these ninja weapons.
Roger
Okay, uh, you need to have your parents here when you buy them, though. I, I can't sell to anyone under eighteen without parents' permission. [the boys look at each other]
Cartman
Parents? Parents?! [fakes a sob] Oh God! [starts sobbing loudly and turns away.]
Roger
Wha- wha- what's the matter? [Cartman continues sobbing]
Stan
We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
Cartman
Why?! [Stan cries, then covers his eyes. Cartman turns around, still sobbing] Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?! [Kenny begins to sob] Why?! [Kyle observes his friends, then joins them in the sobbing]
Kyle
Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
Roger
[tries to soothe them] It's all right, it's all right boys. Don't cry, I'll... I'll just... go pack these up for you, okay? [takes a few weapons and leaves. The boys cry a bit more, then stop]
Stan
Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
Cartman's house, moments later. The boys are in his basement mastering their new weapons. Each boy gets the weapon he wanted. Kyle gets the yellow-ended nunchucks
Stan
[with his tonfa] Kiya! Kiya!
Kyle
Kaii yo! [one end of his nunchaku hits his hat a few times]
Cartman
Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you! [lunges] Iya!
Stan
[sweeps one of his tonfa around and transforms] With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
Kyle
Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku [he transforms], a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
Stan
What's your ninja name, Kenny?
Kenny
[already transformed] (unintelligible)
Cartman
[already transformed] Yes. And I... am Bulrog. Tough brute ninja who has dedicated his life to eradicating the world of hippies
Stan
All right, ninjas! Let's go protect the world!
Cartman
Kick ass! [the boys head out]
Outside, the neighborhood. The boys walk out onto a new, more-detailed landscape
Cartman
Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
Kenny
(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)
Kyle
[cautions] No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
Cartman
Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
Kyle
[the background is a motion blur] You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!
Cartman
Oh yeah?! My mom took me to see Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says you are sneaks and you are liars. And if the Road Warrior says it, it must be true.
Stan
Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go. [they walk off and approach Craig's house, which is done up in Japanese style. Stan stops and whispers] All right, this is it.
Cartman
Yes. The residence of the one called... Craig. [the boys approach quickly]
Kyle
I still say this is a bad idea.
Craig's house. Stan pounds on the door
Stan
Ninja positions! [the boys get into their first positions and Craig opens the door] Hello, Craig!
Cartman
[shows off his sai] Look what we got.
Craig
Where'd you get those?
Stan
We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
Cartman
[moves past Stan] Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
Craig
Uh-uh, they're not that cool.
Stan
Hyeah, "they're not that cool." These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
Kyle
But don't tell anybody we have them.
Cartman
Ugh.
Token
[appears with Clyde, behind Craig] Whoa! Where'd you get those?!
Clyde
Let me see.
Stan
Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. [turns and walks away]
Cartman
Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril. [he and the other two turn and walk away as well] Come on, ninjas!
All
Ho! [they trot off. Craig closes the door]
On the road
Cartman
Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
Stan
Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! [Butters shows up before them]
Butters
Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
Cartman
We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
Butters
Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
Cartman
No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
Stan
Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys. [the boys turn and walk off] We have a lot of work to do.
Cartman
Yes, and no time to do it. No time... [Butters stands in the open alone]
Butters
I think I'd make a really good ninja. [turns right and walks off towards home, rejected] Jeez, those guys never let me play with them. Uh, they just shun me all the time. [opens the front door and enters]
Butter's house. He walks past behind the couch, where his mom reads a book unaware of the emotion in his voice
Butters
I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
Linda
Hi Butters.
Butters
Hi Mom. [walks upstairs] -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude. [enters his room and heads for the closet] And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil. [enters the closet] Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time! [one swoosh of his cape and he transforms] Professor Chaos! [he holds his hands some distance apart and a ball of energy appears. This electrifies his whole body] Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! [cackles. Now transformed, he makes his way downstairs. The stairs crack under his weight. He smashes his left fist into the wall, leaving a small crater in it. His mom looks on from the couch]
Linda
Ooo, Butters, are you going out to play again?
Butters
[in a gravelly voice] Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
Linda
Well, could you be a sweetie and take that pie over there to the Thomsons. I made it to thank them for babysitting you last week.
Butters
Well, o- okay Mom. [sees the pie on the small end table by the foot of the stairs and carries it off] Bah! Gah! [in his mind, he's big and powerful. Every step he takes affects the house. The first dislodges the family portrait, the second dislodges it more, the third knocks it to the ground. He opens the front door, goes out and slams it shot, knocking it off its hinges]
On the road. The boys are shown in their anime forms
Stan
Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
Kyle
Okay, hang on guys. I'll use my special power to see into the future and find out where we should head next.
Cartman
Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
Kyle
God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
Stan
Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
Cartman
I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
Kyle
No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
Cartman
I have the power to have all the powers I want.
Kyle
That doesn't count, fatass!
Stan
Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
Cartman
[protests] C'mon!
Butters
Haaa ha ha ha ha! [he appears with energy bristling all around him] Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
Kyle
Who the hell is that?
Stan
I dunno. Craig, is that you?
Butters
[strikes a ground pose] Fools! [jumps into the air and more energy surges from him. A fireball appears between his hands] I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of Destruction and Doom! [closeup] Your feeble ninja powers are no match for me!
Kyle
Whoa.
Cartman
Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
Stan
[steps forth] Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa! [Stan strikes a battle pose and unleashes the energy from the tonfa tips. Butters shields himself with his cape, and the tonfa energy dissipates. Butters cackles] Hey kid, that knocks you down.
Butters
Nuh uh!
Stan
Yeah, huh, I got you!
Butters
Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
Cartman
That's bullcrap! Titanium alloy my ass!
Kyle
Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! [whips them around a few times and unleashes an icy stream of energy towards Butters. The blasts knock Butters out of the air and he hits the ground with a thud.]
Butters
Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding! [leaps up into the air and jumps back down, strikes the ground with his right fist, and the ground cracks towards the boys, ending with them being tossed into the air. The boys land on the ground again and look up at Butters] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! [two spiderwebs drop down and trap Stan and Kyle]
Cartman
All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay! [Cartman attempts to unleash energy with his hands, but nothing happens.] Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
Kyle
Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
Cartman
All right! And now I will use my power to... [faces the other boys] turn Kyle into a chicken! Bleh! [in an instant Kyle becomes a chicken]
Kyle
God dammit Cartman!
Cartman
Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
Butters
Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
Stan
Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!
Kenny
(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!) [shows off an eight-pointed shuriken] (Feel my wrath!) [unleashes the shuriken, and it strikes Butters in the eye. Butters' helmet flies off, revealing his puff-ball hair and the shuriken embedded in the bloody left eye. The music abruptly stops and the boys are shown in regular form. Butters looks at the boys and sobs loudly]
Cartman
Oh, shit, dude!
Stan
[he and Kyle rush over to Butters] Butters! Oh my God! [the boys gather around Butters] Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
Kyle
What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!
Kenny
(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
Butters
It hurts! It hurts! [continues to sob]
Kyle
Oh man! We are in serious trouble!
Stan
[tries to soothe Butters] Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
Butters
[trying to catch his breath] But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! [Butters continues to shriek in agonizing pain while Stan looks around nervously, with gritted teeth]
Stan
Okay okay, calm down, Butters! It'll be okay! [Butters composes himself and sobs softly, looking around from time to time for any sign of help]
Cartman
Guys, meeting over here for a second? [the boys move off and huddle] All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
Stan
Dude, shut up!
Kyle
I agree with Cartman!
Stan
What?!
Kyle
You don't understand what my mom will do to me if she finds out I was playing with weapons!
a closeup of the shuriken lodged in Butters' left eye, moments later. Some pliers clamp on to it and the camera pulls back. Stan is holding the pliers and he tugs gently at the shuriken. Butters sits on a tree stump
Stan
Just stay still, Butters.
Butters
[Stan tugs again] Ah. [Stan tugs harder] Hwa! [Stan tugs even harder] Hwaaaaa!
Kyle
Stop dude! You're gonna scramble his brain!
Cartman
Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
Butters
You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! [whimpers]
Kyle
If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
Stan
God dammit!
Kyle
[moves off] God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
Cartman
[approaches] Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle. [to the huddle] Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
Butters
Whoa, I'm getting woozy.
Cartman
Shut up, Butters. [to the other boys] Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. [puts his fingertips to his temples. Kenny touches his right temple, Stan, his chin]
Stan
We... need a doctor... But we can't go to the hospital. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. What about the veterinarian?
Cartman
Dr. Shafley?
Stan
He's really old and going blind.
Cartman
So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
Kyle
Oh no.
Stan
We might pass him off as our pet.
Butters
[sniffling] But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
Stan, Kyle, Cartman
Shut up, Butters!
Kyle
That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!
Stan
All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
Moments later. Butters is made up to look like a dog. He sobs in resignation. Kyle holds a bottle of glue.
Cartman
Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. [Kyle hands him the glue]
Butters
[between whimpers] Uh, that modeling glue is making me dizzy.
Cartman
Butters! We're trying to help you, Goddamnit! Now, stop being such an asshole!
Kyle
We need some more fur. [Stan walks over to Sparky and shaves off fur from areas of his body still unshaved, then walks back to Kyle and hands him the fur. Kyle places the fur on Butters' left leg] I think that's good.
Cartman
Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
Butters
Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.
Stan
All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
South Park, in what looks like Skid Row. Stan appears and walks into a clearing
Stan
[looks off to his left] Okay, it's clear. [turns right and walks on. Cartman and Kyle escort Butters between them]
Cartman
Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
Butters
[practices his bark unprompted] Wuhuff, woof, woof.
Kyle
We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! [some trash bin noises are heard and the boys face the source of the noises]
Stan
Oh shit, somebody's coming!
Kyle
Quick, hide Butters! [Cartman drags Butters to an oven]
Cartman
In here! [opens its door and shoves Butters in]
Butters
bu- but fellas, I gotta- [Cartman closes the door. Craig and his boys appear]
Craig
Aha! [the three remaining boys quickly face Craig's crew] There you are! You guys thought you were so cool, didn't you?! Well look at what we got! [Craig and his boys present their weapons]
Cartman
No way, you got weapons too?!
Stan
Where'd you get those?
Jimmy
From the n-n- from the nn-, from the nn-
Clyde
From the nice guy at the county fair.
Craig
At first we needed our parents' permission, but then we told him our parents were dead.
Cartman
Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
Craig
So, [unsheathes his sword] how would you ninjas like to do battle?
Stan
Uh, not now, Craig, we we have to be going.
Craig
You can't pass through this area until you defend your honor! [Clyde crosses his kamas against each other]
Kyle
He said, not now, Craig!
Craig
I am not Craig, [twirls his sword] I am Ginza, [transforms] with the powerful blade of the kitana. Iya!
Token
And I am Black Chaku, [twirls his nunchakus and transforms] with the power of perfect spelling!
Stan
Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay? [Jimmy has already transformed and leaps into the air, twirling his kali sticks around, and lands in a powerful pose]
Jimmy
Wha, what, what's the m-matter, f-fellas? Are you ... nnnninjas or p-p-p-pussies?
Cartman
[the boys are back in anime form] We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
Clyde
Then fight us!
Cartman
Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
Kyle
I swore to never fight again.
Stan
We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! [He begins his attack. The other boys move forth and the fight begins, as a song reminiscent of Japanese anime theme songs, mostly Japanese with occasional English words, starts playing; its lyrics appear as a sing-along along the bottom of the screen.]
Singer
Subarashii chinchin mono
Kintama no kame aru
Sore no oto ha "saru bobo"
Iie! Ninja ga imasu
Hey Hey Let's Go! kenka suru
Taisetsu no mono protect my balls
Boku ga warui so let's fighting
Let's fighting love...
Let's fighting love...
Kono uta chotto baka
Wake ga wakaranai
Eigo ga mechakucha
Daijobu? We do it all the time!
Hey hey let's go kenka suru...

The fight as the song progresses: Jimmy twirls his kali sticks around and aims them at Stan, unleasing two beams of energy. Stan blocks them with his tonfa. Kenny watches Craig be tossed through the air. Token sweeps his nunchucks around and unleases energy towards Kenny, who jumps clear and lets Cartman take the blow. Cartman shatters it with his sai swords. The nunchucks sweep back. Kenny falls to the ground on his ass, behind Cartman. Token attacks Cartman with his nunchucks, but Cartman counters them with his sais, sending Token flying back a few yards. Token rubs his right shoulder. Clyde whips out his kamas and whips them around, and Kyle responds by whipping his nunchucks around. Clyde focuses on Kyle and unleashes a large amount of energy from his kamas. Craig and his crew are shown, then Craig and Kenny fly at each other. Stan takes a stand. Two silhouettes fight. A car rolls by the scene slowly, and the driver simply observes. He sees them are they are, then drives off. The scene reverts to anime letterbox and the boys continue fighting
Stan
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait! [the song ends, and he looks around] Wait. [steps forward] Hold on a second. Where's Butters? [sees the open oven door, and no one in the oven]
Kyle
Oh no. Butters!
Cartman
Butters!
Stan
[turns and faces Craig's boys] Oh, nice going, you assholes! You made us lose him!
Craig
Lose who?
Kyle
[approaches Craig] Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!
Craig
Stuck in his eye? Was he bleeding?
Cartman
Ye-yeah, a little- Butters! Get back here right now!
Craig
Oh shit, you guys are in trouble. We're outta here!
Stan
No dude, you gotta help us find him!
Craig
To hell with that!
Cartman
We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
The road, sunset. Butters walks along the side still sobbing, looking for help
Butters
Hello? Anybody-eh. [the driver appears again and slows down to observe Butters. His right eyebrow rises] Woof. Woof. Woofwoof. [his voice softens] Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. [the drives speeds up and drives off. Butters turns and continues his lonely walk. Back near Skid Row the eight boys walk along searching for Butters.]
Stan
Butters!
Kyle
Butters!
Cartman
Here, Butters!
Kenny
(Butters!)
Craig
Butters!
Clyde
Butters!
Token
Butters!
Jimmy
Bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- bu- Butters!
Cartman
Butter- Butters!
Kyle
Hey Butters!
Stan
Butters!
Kyle
Dude, look! [a black man walks up in anime form, stops, and looks around]
Chef
Hello there, children!
The Boys
Hey, Chef.
Chef
How's it goin'?
Stan
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Kyle
Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
Chef
No, can't say that I have. Hey, what are you children doin' with those weapons?
Stan
Nothing, just... playing.
Chef
Well, you children should be careful with those. You could put somebody's eye out.
Kyle
Yeah, we know.
Chef
Well, I've gotta get to the fairgrounds. They're about to start the big auction. So long, children! [turns and walks away]
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Butters closes in on it, babbling incoherently and stumbling along. He enters the emergency area, moves in a few feet, and falls flat on his back
Nurse
[behind the counter] Oh my God! [leaves her station and kneels down next to Butters] What the-?! Doctor? Doctor?!
Dr. Doctor
[approaches and kneels down next to Butters] Jesus Christ. [Butters shakes his head and babbles] What kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog?! Poor little pup.
Butters
[moans, then opens his eyes] Woof woof.
Nurse
Can you help him, Doctor?
Dr. Doctor
I'm afraid I wouldn't know how. Unfortunately for this little fella, I'm a people doctor. Best we call the animal shelter.
Nurse
[rises and leaves] Right away.
Announcer
[with recaps from the episode] In our last episode the four ninjas did battle with Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and doom. It was during that great battle that ninja master Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious trouble, because their parents might find out they had weapons, if Professor Chaos told on them. While trying to get Professor Chaos some aid at the veterinarian's office, the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends. They challenged the four ninjas to fight, and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began. It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped, and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos, or else they would all be grounded.
Stan
Butters!
Kyle
Butters!
Cartman
Here, Butters!
Kenny
(Butters!)
Craig
Butters!
Clyde
Butters!
Token
Butters!
Craig
Butters! Where the hell are you?!
Kyle
It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! [moves off]
Stan
What?
Kyle
[reaches a well and holds his nunchucks over it] Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
Cartman
[with his sais] Screw that, dude, I paid twenty bucks for these things!
Stan
Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
Kyle
We don't have time for that, dude! We just have to ditch them! Now!
Cartman
Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
Kyle
Screw you, fatass! [struggles to loosen his grip on the nunchucks]
Cartman
Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming "NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!" You know this to be true. [Kyle continues struggling and begins to grunt] Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle. [closeup of Cartman's lips] Do it. [Kyle struggles even harder, but eventually gives in]
Kyle
[walks up next to Stan] I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
Stan
It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
South Park Animal Shelter, day. Dogs and cats are heard. Inside, an elderly veterinarian pulls something along on a leash
Vet
Come on. Come on, little fella. 'Atta boy. [Butters appears at the other end of the leash, crawling in]
Butters
[in a gravelly voice] Woof woof. [babbles incoherently. The veterinarian leads him towards a cell]
Vet
Right over here. [opens the gate] Good dog. Come on. [guides Butters in] There you go, right in there. [closes the gate and locks it, then leaves] Goooood dog. [Butters babbles some more as a dog approaches from his left and sniffs. The dog pisses on him and walks away. Butters' voice rises in protest. Another dog approaches from his right, sniffs him, and pisses on him. Butters' voice rises a bit more in protest. A third dog approaches from his left, turns around, and craps on him. Butters stands up]
Butters
Gaaaah!
Assistant
Somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppy's eye?
Vet
It just makes me sick how some people can treat animals. [pulls out a large syringe, quickly] Well, nothing we can do for it; let's put it to sleep, shall we? [they move back into Butters' cell] Here you go, pup. I've got a sweet dose of murder for you. [] What the? Blasted! He's escaped! ...Oh well, let's murder one of these other dogs.
The county fair, anime form, sunset
Stan
All right, the county fair's still open! [they spot Roger, shown in anime form, and approach his booth.]
Roger
Can I help you boys?
Stan
We have come to return the weapons we purchased.
Roger
Uh, sorry kids, ah I don't give refunds.
Kyle
Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
Roger
I thought you told me your parents were dead.
Craig
[approaches with his boys] You guys! [the other boys turn around] You guys!
Stan
What is it, Craig?
Craig
It's Butters! We saw 'im!
Kyle
Where?!
Craig
Right on the other side of the fairgrounds. He's just wandering around aimlessly.
Kyle
Then it's not too late!
Stan
Come on, Ninjas! [the boys make their way across the fairgrounds, but freeze in their tracks upon seeing the auction]
Barker
[in anime form] All right, folks, our next item up for bids is this lovely 19th Century lamp.
Stan
Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
Craig
Butters is right on the other side.
Kyle
We have to get past them!
Cartman
All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
Kyle
You have that power too?
Cartman
I told you, Bulrog has lots and lots of powers. Behold. [steps aside and holds his arms up. He sweeps them down and disappears. He them removes his clothes and gathers them into a pile] This way, I can move about the crowd of people undetected. [walks over to Stan and hands his clothes over] Here, hold this stuff for me.
Stan
[softly] Good luck, Bulrog. [Cartman leaves, with only his footsteps indicating where he's going]
Barker
Now, this lamp comes from the estate of Edna and James Hollinger, who lived in upstate Wyoming. [Cartman, in normal form, appears, tip-toeing across the stage sideways. His penis can be seen.] It has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base. This is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique. [Cartman changes his gait and tip-toes forward. The bidders look on] The lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars. [Cartman changes his gait and tip-toes along sideways. One of the staffers notices Cartman and taps his colleague. The colleague looks and gasps] So we're gonna start the bidding at three hundred and seventy five. Do I, do I hear three hundred and seventy five? [Cartman continues tip-toeing along and the bidders sit motionless. Eight seconds pass before Cartman stops, realizing that the crowd can indeed see him.] Kid, what the hell do you think you're doin'? [Cartman looks around, knowing he's stuck.]
Butters
[wanders on stage] Haba, haba! Habahoaha! [babbles some more, then falls flat on his back again]
Linda
[rises with her hands on her chest] Butters! [the auction staff encircles the boy]
Randy
What happened to him?
Sheila
Oh my God!
Stan
Oh, Jesus.
Kyle
Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
Park County Community Center, Emergency Town Meeting, day. The chatter among the adults present is heated
Mayor McDaniels
All right, people, we are all extremely upset over what's happened. [the boys' parents are present, with angry faces on] But let's try to speak one at a time.
Man 1
Well, like the rest of you, I am shocked and appalled at what happened! I don't know if the parents are to blame or if it's the times we're living in, but something has to change!
Townsfolk
[amid chatter] Yeah! I agree!
Gerald
This is the worst thing that's happened in this town! [Butters is shown with a patch over his left eye and a long gauze wrapped around his head to keep the patch in place] The worst thing!
Man 2
Yeah! I mean, there were children watching that auction! And when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his... penis! It was an outrage! [the adults go into an uproar again]
Stan
What?
Cartman
What?
Skeeter
Not only that, the auction was televised on public access, so my little daughter watchin' at home saw the... penis! How am I supposed to explain that to her?!
Sheila
This is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down! [the adults go into an uproar again]
Mr. Garrison
[next to Mr. Mackey] You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!
Cartman
I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. [the adults go into an uproar again]
Kyle
Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
Stan
Just run with it, dude.
Kyle
[looks around, then stands on his chair] Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!
Man
Yeah! [the adults go into an uproar again]
Cartman
Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
Park County Community Center, outside. The doors open and Stan, Kyle, and Kenny exit onto the parking lot
Kyle
Yeah, I c- I can't believe it.
Stan
Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
Kyle
[pulls out his nunchucks] So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
Stan
[he and Kenny pull out their weapons] Yeah. Come on, ninjas. [they transform into their anime forms] We've got some more work to do.
The Boys
[leap into a pose, and the image is frozen] Hya!
End of Good Times With Weapons. Stills of the episode are shown along with "Let's Fighting Love"
End of Good Times with Weapons

Up the Down Steroid
Stan's backyard, day. The boys are playing the "Investigative Reports with Bill Curtis" game when Timmy and Jimmy arrive.
Jimmy
Hey fellas.
Stan
Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
Timmy
Timmy!
Jimmy
[carries a brochure under his right arm] Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.
Cartman
[approaches Jimmy] The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
Kyle
They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
Cartman
[snickers] What?
Jimmy
[hands Cartman the brochure] Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
Stan
Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
Kyle
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Jimmy
Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year.
Kyle
Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
Timmy
Timmy! [he and Jimmy walk off.]
Cartman
Dude. I can't believe they exploit handicapped people like this. I mean, making them compete against each other just for our amusement.
Kyle
...You're an asshole, Cartman.
Cartman
What? What'd I do?
Denver Athletic Club, Denver, day. Inside, the athletes are working out on a variety of equipment. Jimmy and Timmy are at a bench press. Jimmy presses weights as Timmy spots him.
Jimmy
S-s-six!
Timmy
Timmah.
Jimmy
S-s-s-ssseven!
Timmy
Timmah. Timmah!
Jimmy
S-s-seven!
Timmy
Timmah! Timmah!
Jimmy
[gets back on count, but falters] Ni- I can- I can't! [Timmy helps Jimmy put the weights back on the bar rest] Huff. Oh man. [sits up] Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year. [another kid at a nearby bench press laughs] All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven reps. Oh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.
Timmy
Timmah. [Jimmy walks away]
Francis
Hey Jimmy, g-good luck on Saturday.
Jimmy
[turns and looks] You too, Francis. [looks forward and resumes walking. In a darkened hallway stands a big athlete with an air of hauteur about him]
Nathan
Hey Jimmy.
Jimmy
Oh he-hey, N-Nathan.
Nathan
So uh, I see you train pretty hard.
Jimmy
[moves into the hallway and faces Nathan] Yeah, it sure is tough. I'm training really hard, but I'm not improving fast enough, and the Special Olympics are a... week away.
Nathan
Weeell uh, maybe I can help you out. You know, there are shortcuts.
Jimmy
What kind of shortcuts?
Nathan
You know. Steroids.
Jimmy
S-s-ss-s-s-steroids? [Nathan signals him to be quite as another handicapped athlete walks by] ...But aren't those illegal?
Nathan
Yeah, sure, but these are new. They don't show up in our urine tests.
Jimmy
So uh, ha-how do they... w-w-work?
Nathan
[holds out a prescription bottle] You just take one of these little blue babies [holds up three fingers] three times a day [reaches into a fanny pack and pulls out a syringe] and inject this directly into your bloodstream [holds up two fingers] twice a day before meals.
Jimmy
How much would this cost me?
Nathan
Uuuh, it isn't cheap. I've gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas.
Jimmy
[looks around uneasily] Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a performance.
Nathan
Oh, whatever you say, Jimmy my friend. [steps closer] Whatever you say. [Jimmy reaches out for the drugs]
Stan's house, front yard. The boys are playing with various toy big rigs. Stan moves a gas truck, Kenny an ambulance, Kyle a tow truck.
Cartman
[rushes up with the brochure] You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
Kyle
What?
Cartman
Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000" [he looks at his friends as his jaw drops]
Stan
So?
Cartman
So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
Kyle
Oh no. Cartman, no!
Cartman
It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
Stan
That's really, really terrible, dude.
Cartman
Terrible?? Whatever! You guys' brains just can't compute complex plans like mine can! It'll work, you'll see. [walks off]
Kyle
[moves and catches up to Cartman] Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
Cartman
Why?
Kyle
Because! [takes away the brochure]
Cartman
What are you gonna do, Kyle?! Tell on me?! [points an accusing finger at him] Then you'll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale! [lowers it] Is that really how you deal with your problems?! Grow up, Kyle! [turns around and walks off. Kyle seethes in silence. Cartman now talks to himself] All I have to do is make people think I'm handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won't be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.
A montage, to the tune of "Scarface (Put It To The Limit)" Cartman sits at his computer typing away. Onscreen are his plans for looking handicapped, "Ways to Appear Handicapped." He's then at the library poring over piles of books. The librarian wheels a cartload of books over, Cartman points to the spot at which they should be dropped off, and the librarian obliges. Cartman then rides to school in the Special Ed bus, taking notes on the behavior of handicapped students. Next, he's in the bathroom at home contorting his face this way and that, then takes more notes. He leafs through another book and types in more notes into his computer, then pours himself some more coffee.
Cartman goes to a clothing store looking for ill-fitting clothes. He then cobbles a custom shoe for himself. He goes home and tries it out. He goes to a CGI studio and puts on a motion suit so he can make a 3D model of himself on a computer. He takes the 3D model home and modifies it on his own computer: "Handicapped Walk Analysis." He then goes into the bathroom and cuts off clumps of his hair to look as if he were retarded. He goes to the living room and looks at a Kid Rock video for more inspiration and takes notes. He puts on a bicycle helmet and pulls his hair out through the holes. He assembles the various parts of his handicapped outfit and puts it on. He squishes his face upwards for the finishing touch and ties the helmet straps together well below his chin.
Cartman
Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics. [loosens the chin straps and lowers his face to normal] Bull's eye!
Jimmy's house, bedroom, night. Jimmy is at his bed. He straps on a strip of heavy rubberband, dabs his arm a few times with alcohol, jabs the syringe into his arm and injects some liquid steroids into his arm. He loosens the rubber band and someone knocks on his door. He looks around and jumps off his bead.
Jimmy
Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second! [heads for his duffel bag and hauls it to his night stand. The knock is heard again]
Dad
Jimmy?
Jimmy
[sweeps the steroids into the bag] Hang on, I'm-I'm, coming. [rushes to the closet and shoves the duffle bag in.]
Dad
Jim, it's your father!
Jimmy
[walking towards the door] I said I'm coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second! [realizes he still has the syringe in his mouth] Hold it. [and spits it out. He opens the door and sees his father with a cup of coffee.]
Dad
Jimmy, were you masturbating?
Jimmy
N-no, Dad.
Dad
Okay. Well, you have a visitor. [the camera pans down to a pretty girl, who enters the room]
Girl
Hi Jimmy.
Jimmy
Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy.
Nancy
I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow.
Jimmy
Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.
Dad
I didn't know you had a girlfriend, Jim.
Jimmy
Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.
Dad
I'll leave you two alone. [reaches for the door, but stops] Y-You sure you weren't masturbating, Jim? It's okay if you were.
Jimmy
Dad, Jesus C-Christ!
Dad
Okay, then. [they look at each other]
A basketball court, day. The boys take turn shooting hoops, but none of them make a basket. Cartman waddles into view in his handicapped getup.
Cartman
Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey. [the boys stop and look] Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
Kyle
[low voice] God damn you!
Cartman
You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away. [This means it's Tuesday prior] I'm going to go sign up now.
Kyle
No you're not! [whips out the brochure] I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
Cartman
What?! [takes the brochure back from Kyle]
Kyle
It says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! [grins confidently. Cartman looks at him, then at the brochure and reads]
Cartman's house, later. Liane is at the kitchen table paying bills. Cartman walks in from the dining room. He puts his arms behind his back.
Cartman
Moooommmm?
Liane
Yes, hon? [begins writing a check]
Cartman
Um, could I get you to do something for me?
Liane
What's that, hon?
Cartman
Um, okay. This is goin' ta sound a little strange. Um, but, stick with me. Um, moooommm? Would you mind coming with me to sign up for the Special Olympics so I can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars? [Liane looks up and goes pale]
Liane
Oh... N- no, sweetie. I believe those Olympics are just for... "special" children.
Cartman
I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
Liane
You are, hon, but... I don't think that's a very good idea. [writes out another check]
Cartman
...I'll split the money with you. [Liane stops]
Liane
...I'm sorry, Eric. The answer is No. [Cartman is upset and begins to think a little harder]
Cartman
[walks up to the table] All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth. [under his breath] God, this is gonna be hard to say. [normally] I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change. [looks up at her with longing] Help me change?
Liane
Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I'll take you tomorrow.
Cartman
Awesome.
Denver Athletic Club, day. Jimmy and Timmy are in the locker room getting ready to leave.
Jimmy
You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving.
Timmy
Timmah!
Jimmy
I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?
Timmy
[slips on his sweater] Timmah! [reaches over for the bag and grabs a handle. The contents spill out, since he didn't grab the other handle, and he sees the steroids drop to the floor. He looks down sadly and holds the bag a litle closer. Jimmy is frozen in place. Timmy's voice shakes] Tim- Timmy?
Jimmy
Oh, uh, so... hey, Timmy... uh hu-how about we go out for a s-s-soda later? [sweeps the steroids back into the bag. Timmy finds a bottle on his pants and looks at it. Jimmy finishes up and leaves] I'll uh, I-I'll see you later, Tim-Tim.
Timmy
[turns and exclaims] Timmah... [the tone of voice stops Jimmy]
Jimmy
[turns] Look it's really none of your b-b-b-beeswax, Timmy!
Timmy
[rolls up to Jimmy] Timmah. Timmah!
Jimmy
Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!
Timmy
[turns aside and sighs] Timmah. [rolls away a bit] T-T-Timmah.
Jimmy
You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?
Timmy
Huh! Timmah! T-Timmah!
Jimmy
Look, it's my b-body and it's my choice what I put in it!
Timmy
Timmah! Timmah, Jimmih! [points to himself] Arrrh Timmah! [points to himself] Jimmih!
Jimmy
Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
Timmy
[spent] Huh... Timmah... [holds the bottle out over the floor] Timmah.
Jimmy
[angered] S-s-s-so what are you gonna do now, huh?! You gonna be a fuckin' narc and show that b-bottle to the... coaches?! [Timmy drops the bottle on the ground, turns around and rolls away. Jimmy watches him leave] Don't think you're any better than me, Timmy! I'm just living in the real world! [looks down at the bottle, then kicks the bottle away with his left crutch] Fuck!
The Special Olympic Field, next day. Timmy is in the field ready for the javelin throw.
Timmy
Timmah! [rolls forward and throws the javelin] Aaar-yaaaaah Timmah! [the javelin hits the ground near a coach]
Coach
All right, thirty yards, Timmy! Keep it up!
Timmy
Oowrrr! Timmah! Livilaye!
Jimmy
[runs down a track for the long jump] Y-yeess! [jumps into the air and lands]Grrrr!
Coach 2
Wuh-wow, Jimmy, I can't believe how much you've improved! You're bigger and stronger than I've ever seen you!
Jimmy
Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard.
Coach 2
You keep going like this and you'll break Special Olympics records on Saturday!
The Special Olympic Field, registration table, moments later. A family of three arrives.
Man
Okay, so this is all the stuff we need to sign Michael in?
Volunteer
Yup. Just take the sign-up sheet down to the next table and we'll get it all finalized.
Woman
Thank you very much.
Volunteer
Thank you! Good luck, Michael.
Michael
Thanks.
Volunteer
Okay, next in line please?
Cartman
[looking really retarded, steps up to the table with his mom] Naaaa! Daaaaa!
Volunteer
Hello there.
Liane
Hello. Um, I would like to... sign my son up, please.
Cartman
Naaaa!
Volunteer
Oh, great! What's his name?
Liane
Eric Cartman...
Cartman
Caaartmaaan! Daaaaa!
Volunteer
Okay. Age?
Liane
He's nine.
Volunteer
O-kay, and what's his disability?
Liane
...Um, he's retarded. [Cartman offers a retarded grin]
Volunteer
...N-no, I'm asking what his specific condition is. Down's Syndrome? Cerebral palsy?
Liane
Ohhh, oh. I'm not sure. [Cartman looks up with some concern] Sweetie, what is your condition?
Cartman
...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
Volunteer
I'll just leave that blank for now.
The Special Olympic Field, under the bleachers. Jimmy prepares to inject more steroids into his right arm.
Jimmy
[performs the injection] Yeah, b-bigger, stronger! [Timmy rolls by and hears him, then raises his eyes in alarm]
South Park Elementary, day. Timmy rolls to Mr. Mackey's office, sighs and knocks.
Mr. Mackey
[opens the door] Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in. [Timmy follows Mr. Mackey in] I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay?
Timmy
[leans forward and begins] Timmy.
Mr. Mackey
Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it.
Timmy
[sighs and begins again] Timmy.
Mr. Mackey
Mmm'kay, right, you're Timmy. ...Yo-you have a problem?
Timmy
[shakes his head vigorously] No Timmy, Jimmy.
Mr. Mackey
Ji-Jimmy?
Timmy
[showing his frustration] Haaa! [remembers something] Oh, oh! [wheels over to a class picture of the fourth graders. Jimmy is at one end of the front row, with Mr. Garrison behind him. Timmy reaches up and points] Jimmy.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?
Timmy
[rolls back and tries to get the story out with gestures. He demonstrates Jimmy asking for his bag] Timmah! Timmah, uh, Jimmih. [demonstrates himself handing the bag to Jimmy and seeing the contents fall out] Hey Timmy, Timmah Tim-oh! Tim-Timmah! [shows his reaction to the steroids] Timmmah? Jimmih! Jimmih. [demonstrates the argument between the two] Jimmih Timmah Timmah? Timmah, Timmah! Jimmih... Jimmih! Jimmih! Timmah! [demonstrates the bottle being dropped] Timmah!
Mr. Mackey
[confused] Mmmmm'kaaay. I don't quite follow, Timmy.
Timmy
Argh. Jimmy...
Mr. Mackey
Right, Jimmy Valmer.
Timmy
Uh. [demonstrates himself minding his own business when he sees Jimmy shooting up in the shadows], Timmah Jimmih Jimmih Jim- [demonstrates the injection, then flexes his muscles and takes a sinister tone] Jimmh Timmah Timmah Jimmih!
Mr. Mackey
Right. He's Jimmy, yeah.
Timmy
[really frustrated] Haaaaaaaaaah!
Cartman's room, night. Cartman types away at his computer. Screen reads: How I Will Spend My One Thousand Dollars By Eric Cartman. A knock on his door is heard.
Cartman
Enter. [Kyle enters, and walks up next to Cartman]
Kyle
Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. [they look at each other and Cartman closes a book he had open for reference]
Cartman
Go on, Kyle.
Kyle
I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
Cartman
Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion of the Jew.
Kyle
I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
Cartman
Let me finish. If you had seen The Passion you would know that Hell is reserved for the Jews, and all those who don't accept Christ. That being the case, it is actually me who is worried about your soul.
Kyle
I came here to talk about you!
Cartman
Yes. [hops off his seat and consoles Kyle] And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle. [whispers] Good luck. [after a few seconds, Kyle turns around and goes to leave. He opens the door, turns around to say something but instead walks out. Cartman just hums a tune, goes back to the computer and reads some more.]
Jimmy's house. He's working out on a bench press in his room. A mirror sits next to him.
Jimmy
Come on, push it! Push it! [he pushes the weights onto the bar rest and sits up. He checks his musculature out in the mirror] Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. [the door opens and Nancy enters]
Nancy
Jimmy, I thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop.
Jimmy
The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.
Nancy
I guess I didn't realize I was a waste of time.
Jimmy
Oh Jesus! [lays back down and takes up the weights] You gonna start running your mouth off again? [begins new reps] P-push it! Push it!
Nancy
Jimmy, everyone's worried about you. You seem... different.
Jimmy
They-they're all just... jealous.
Nancy
You're not the boy I fell in love with last week during Free Period. I'm leaving you.
Jimmy
[quickly rests the weights and sits up] You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!
Nancy
You can't treat people like this!
Jimmy
[gets up and walks over to Nancy, then begins beating her with his crutches. She wails] I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?! [he grabs her by the throat and throws her head against the floor a few times, then whacks her on the side of the head a few times.] You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told! [resumes beating her. His mom opens the door to see what's the matter]
Sarah Valmer
What the? [tries to stop the beating] Jimmy, oh my God!
Jimmy
[throws his mother off and heads for the door] Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches! [walks down the hall, hits the walk with his right crutch, and breaks down.] No! God! [collapses on his back and bawls]
Saturday morning at the Special Olympics stadium.
Host
Welcome, everyone, to the 2004 Special Olympics! [the crowd cheers. The boys are there, as promised] We will be holding various throughout the day, and at the end of it all we will have some very special celebrity athletes here to present the trophy for top athlete, along with the cash prize of one thousand dollars.
Jimmy
[flexes his right bicep] Top athlete, yeah!
Cartman
One thousand dollars, yeah!
Host
So let's have all our athletes report to their first assigned events and... Let the Games begin! [The crowd cheers wildly]
First event, Track and Field, 100-meter dash.
Announcer
Will those athletes in heat 1 of the hundred-meter dash please report to Track Area B.
Volunteer 2
Okay, racers, are we ready? [raises her firing pistol] Take your marks.
Cartman
[hobbles into the fifth position on the track] Daaaa! Daaaa!
Volunteer 2
On your marks! Get set! Go! [the runners take off. Cartman quickly falls behind]
Cartman
Whoa. What the hell?? [the girl in position 6 breaks the tape. Cartman hobbles past the finish line four seconds later]
Volunteer 2
Great job, everyone. [points to the runners who were in positions 6, 2, and 4] You three advance to the next heat. [the group leaves]
Winner
All right!
Blond Boy
Good Job.
Blonde Girl
We did it!
Cartman
Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
"Put It To The Limit" begins to play again. Cartman is in a swimming competition now, but again, he's struggling in last place. Jimmy lifts a bar laden with weights successfully in the clean-and-jerk competition, then throws the bar down.
Jimmy
Yeeessss! [walks back and forth happily] Yes! Yes!
Announcer
He's got it! That's a new Special Olympics record, folks! [Timmy is understandably unimpressed and pissed off]
Back to Track and Field events, 100-meter hurdles. Cartman is again last.
Cartman
[trips over a hurdle] God-damnit!
Back to Swimming events. Jimmy takes his heat easily.
Announcer
Winner, Jimmy Valmer! [Jimmy flexes his left arm and scrambles out of the water. Timmy is more pissed off]
Track and Field events, pole-vault. a Special Olympian runs up to the posts, plants his pole in the square mark, and clears the bar successfully. Cartman steps up to the straight track with his pole.
Cartman
All right, this one I can win! [drops his pole, takes off his helmet and gives it to another athlete] Here, hold this! [takes up his pole and aims] I'll show you Goddamned retards! [runs up to the posts, plants his pole, and sails up, but the pole won't straighten out. It flexes a few time before it breaks, sending Cartman back down to the track, where he lands on his back]
Track and Field events, 100-meter hurdles. Jimmy increases his lead over the competition.
Track and Field events, javelin throw. An athlete runs up to the edge and throws his javelin. His tongue hangs out. Timmy rolls up and throws his javelin. Cartman runs up and throws his, but it lands just far enough for him to still touch the tail end of it.
Cartman
God-damnit!
Track and Field events, triple jump. Jimmy jumps and lands at 18.5 feet, skids a foot more, then stops and waits for the score.
Announcer
That's another Special Olympics record!
Jimmy
[raises his arms and crutches up in victory] Yeah! Yeah! [turns around] Yeah, I did it! [turns around] Yeah! Yeah!
Early evening at the Special Olympics stadium. The sun has set and some of the crowd is back on the field.
Host
Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition has come to an end, and we have an ultimate grand special champion for 2004! Here to present the award are baseball legends Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds. [the three players come out and walk to the podium. All of them are buff]
Bonds
The 2004 special athlete is... Jimmy Valmer.
Jimmy
[raises up his left arm and crutch] Yeah! Fuck yeah! [Timmy sits nearby with his arms crossed, glaring at Jimmy. Jimmy walks up to the podium] Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best! [Bonds hands Jimmy the medal. The host returns to the podium]
Host
Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn't just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!
Cartman
Ah, screw you hippies!
Host
For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey's for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!
Cartman
...I could pile at Shakey's, heck. [puts on his helmet and walks up] Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
Jimmy
[confronts Cartman] Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?!
Cartman
[humbly] Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh.
Jimmy
You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?! [grabs Cartman by the collar] I should kick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!
Timmy
[approaches] Timmah!
Jimmy
What?
Timmy
[points to Jimmy] Timmah!
Jimmy
[thinks a moment] Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right. [walks up to the mic and begins talking]
Jimmy
Everyone, can I have your attention, please? [everyone falls silent] I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting. [a shot of Nancy, injured and taped around the head. She smiles] A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him. [a shot of Timmy, who smiles and shows off his silver medal. Others around him wear bronzes.] Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics. [a shot of a chastened Cartman before the baseball players]
Jimmy
Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a [shot of Mark McGuire] big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say, [shot of Barry Bonds] "Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- " [shot of Jason Giambi] "-steroid-taking jackass." [Giambi nods ever so subtly] That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor. [applause rises from the stands, followed by cheers. The volunteers and baseball players gather around Jimmy]
McGuire
Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.
The stands. Cartman walks up to his friends.
Cartman
Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids. [he looks at Kyle and then Stan for a reaction, but neither offers any. He frowns, then steps forward angrily] Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes! [straightens up] Grow up! [walks off in a huff]
End of Up the Down Steroid

The Passion of the Jew
Cartman's house, day. A minivan rocks gently on the street. Inside, the boys make their interpretations of spaceship noises. Being the good boys that they are, they're strapped in. They're wearing football helmets and makeshift Starfleet uniforms.
Cartman
[in the driver's seat] Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
Stan
Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
Cartman
What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
Kyle
I'm a Vulcan!
Cartman
All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
Kyle
[looking into an imaginary viewer] The atmosphere is oxygen-based, should support our breathing.
Cartman
All right, hang on. We're about to land. [the boys make landing noises, with Stan finishing off with a thump. Cartman removes his seatbelt] Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
Kyle
No! I'm on the away team too! [he and Kenny remove their belts]
Cartman
[looks back] It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
Kyle
I don't care! You're not making me wait in the van again!
Cartman
Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
The side door slides open. Cartman leads the other three out.
Cartman
Set phasers on stun.
Stan
Things seem pretty quiet.
Cartman
Yes. A little too quiet.
Kyle
I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. [Cartman sighs silently]
Cartman
Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it! [the boys take their positions and start firing away] Oh no, it got Kyle!
Kyle
[stops firing and stands still] No it doesn't. [the other boys continue with their phaser noises]
Cartman
Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off! [pretends to be the monster ripping Kyle's head off] Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
Kyle
No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
Cartman
Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
Kyle
Shut up about Jews, fatass! You don't know anything!
Stan
Oh God, here we go again.
Cartman
Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
Kyle
He does not!
Cartman
How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
Kyle
Naw uh!
Cartman
Go see the movie, Kyle!
Stan
That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
Kenny
(Me too!) [they leave]
Kyle
I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
Cartman
You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
Kyle
People don't hate the Jews!
Cartman
[focuses Kyle's attention to him] Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
Kyle
...You're a stupid asshole! [turns and walks off. Cartman turns left and glances at Kyle]
Cartman
Sweet, now I can just play with myself. [fires off his phaser] Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! [races into the minivan]
The Bijou, day. Mel Gibson's The Passion of The Christ is now playing. Kyle walks up to the ticket booth, stops, turns back, stops again, and steps up to the window. He gives the ticket salesman $10.
Kyle
One please.
Ticket Salesman
This is an R-rated movie.
Kyle
Yeah, I know, but I have to-
Ticket Salesman
But, because this is such an important film that actually depicts the selfless act of Jesus Christ, I'll let you in to see it.
Kyle
...Thanks. [makes his way towards the doors, glancing back at the cashier in wonder]
The Bijou, inside. Kyle enters and makes his way to a seat. He watches.
Soldier 1
Hac bashtud Christo.
Soldier 2
Et lac Hesus. Belaca veshtad.
Jesus
Wa! [the whipping begins and Jesus screams. This goes on for a long time. Kyle's mouth widens, his eyes get bigger. The next scene, he's got his coat over his mouth and he's almost in a fetal position. The next scene has him turned to his left, grimacing, his hat pulled over his ears as he winces. The next scene has him trembling]
Kyle
Haaaah! [Next scene has Kyle with his eyes squeezed shut and his hands over his face. He's now curled up in a ball]
Jesus
Non. Non. Nono, non, non, WAAAAHH!! [the whipping continues and Kyle dares to peek again. His stomach reacts and he vomits. The next scene has him almost passed out with vomit dribbling from his chin. The film ends and Kyle doesn't move.]
The Bijou, outside. Kyle walks outside in a daze.
Kyle
How? How could the Jews do that to Jesus?
Ticket Salesman
Pretty brutal, isn't it? Kinda wanna make you change your life, huh?
Cartman's house, day. He's on the couch eating cereal.
Announcer
And now, back to Terrance and Phillip. [the doorbell rings]
Phillip
Hey Terrance, I think I have a-
Cartman
Mom! Doorbell!
Terrance
Wait, before you do, pull my thumb. [a second laughter and laughter is heard.]
Cartman
[the doorbell rings] Mom! Answer the door!
Terrance
Hey Phillip, guess what?
Cartman
God damn it, lazy-ass whore. [gets up and answers the door himself.]
Phillip
What?
Terrance
Faaart.[Terrance farts. Cartman opens the door and sees Kyle soaking wet from the heavy rain]
Kyle
You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
Cartman
It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
Kyle
You were, you were right?
Cartman
[closes his eyes and relishes the moment] Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
Kyle
You were right. [Cartman opens his eyes and beams brightly]
Cartman's house, his bedroom. Cartman's on his knees.
Cartman
I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done. [a shot of Mel Gibson's poster, without the "Braveheart" on it.] Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
Stan's house. He and Kenny are in his bedroom reading a newspaper.
Stan
Look at that, dude. The Passion has made almost 400 million dollars at the box office now.
Kenny
(Goddamn.)
Stan
[rises] Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
The Bijou, day. No clouds around. Stan and Kenny sit inside in the middle, looking at the movie. The movie ends.
Stan
Dude. That movie sucked.
Kenny
(Yeah, it totally sucked!)
Stan
How can they even call that a movie?
Kenny
(I don't know!)
Stan
That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
Kenny
(Yeah!) [they leave their seats]
The Bijou, outside. A couple emerges.
Jack
Wow, I didn't realize how horrible Christ's death was.
Elise
Me neither. Oh honey, let's be good Christians from now on! [they walk off, screen left. A second couple emerges]
Man 1
[brown shirt, green sweater] I think if more people saw The Passion they'd have faith in Jesus.
Woman 1
[orange blouse, necklace] Yeah, it really guilt-trips you into believing. [they walk off, screen right. Stan and Kenny come out and approach the window]
Stan
Hey, we want our money back.
Ticket Salesman
Huh?
Stan
That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
Ticket Salesman
I can't refund your money. You sat through the whole movie.
Stan
That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
Kenny
(Yeah!)
Stan
You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
Ticket Salesman
That guy happened to be Jesus, and he went through all that to pay for your sins!
Stan
We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
Ticket Salesman
I'm not allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie! You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.
Stan
W-what? Mel Gibson? You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?
Ticket Salesman
Yeah. I'd like to see you try.
Stan
Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! [he and Kenny storm off]
Kyle's house, night. Kyle tosses and turns while asleep. Scenes from the movie fill his mind: Jesus carrying the cross past the high priests, who have scowling faces. Flashes of Renaissance Passion art go by.
Priests
Kill him! Guilty! Kill him! [sketches of a nail driven through the left palm are animated, then a realistic view of Jesus crucified] Kill him! Kill him! Die!
Kyle
Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! [a spear pierces Jesus' side. The one piercing him is Kyle himself, who seems to be relishing this, as he pierces Jesus a few more times. A review of images, then an image of Alan Alda, and Kyle wakes up frightened. After a few screams he looks around]
Stan's house, day. Stan and Kenny are at Stan's computer.
Stan
Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go. [clicks on the link] Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! "For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.." Okay, okay, wait, here we go. [picks up the phone and dials in]
MEL GIBSON FAN CLUB LINE
The phone rings. Cartman answers.
Cartman
Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
Stan
Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
Cartman
Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
Stan
No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
Cartman
What?
Stan
We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
Cartman
You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
Stan
Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
Cartman
If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
Stan
Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
Cartman
Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
Stan
I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
Cartman
Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
Stan
Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
Cartman
I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
Stan
[in recognition] Wait a minute. Cartman?! [realizing he's been recognized, Cartman is speechless]
Cartman
Eup. [hangs up and skulks away]
Stan
[packing] Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
Kenny
(Malibu? But how?)
Stan
We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible! [He leads Kenny out of his room] This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
Cartman's house, day. Cartman dons a Nazi outfit, taking care to look sharp.
Liane
Eric, sweetie, there's a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting?
Cartman
Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
Liane
Oh, that's great, sweetie.
Cartman
[turns right so his profile will look sharp as well] Tell them I'll be down shortly
Liane
Okay, hon.
Cartman
[wields his short whip]Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. [a shot of the poster.]
Cartman's backyard. Some people are seated, others chat, others help themselves to chips and fingerfoods.
Man 1
Hello, are you folks holding this Passion meeting?
Jack
No. Actually, we're guests as well. I'm Jack Garrett and this is my wife Elise.
Elise
Hello.
Man 2
I think it's so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this.
Elise
Oh I agree. There are so many of us who are moved by The Passion. It's a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the Christian community.
Man 2
And apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film.
Jack
Leave it to a child to show us all the way, huh?
Ticket Salesman
Yeah, so I see this ad on the Internet saying if you love The Passion to come to this meeting, so here I am!
Woman 2
It's great that everyone came here to figure out how to use The Passion to enrich everyone's lives. [Cartman approaches the dais.]
Cartman
Ah, hello everyone. Achtung. [the last few standing people take their seats] My name is Eric Cartman and I'm the President of the Mel Gibson Fan Club. [applause] Ah thank you, thank you. I'm happy to see that all of you.were affected by The Passion like I was. Now, we all know why we're here, and I believe we all what needs to be done.
Woman 3
[in pink dress] We sure do. [the crowd voices its approval]
Cartman
But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. [the guests fall silent]
Elise
[in orange blouse] Wha- what does that mean, sweetie?
Jack
I'm not sure, but- uh. [stands up] Folks, I just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together. The Passion is causing a revolution of spirituality, and we owe Mel Gibson and this little boy our thanks. [the crowd voices its approval]
Cartman
[bows a few times] Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we [his face turns ugly] all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
Man 3
Oh, what a great idea! We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!
Guests
Heheh, great! Yeah! Great idea.
Cartman
Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
Ticket Salesman
We sure do!
Guests
Yeah. All right. Woohoo!
Mel's Malibu mansion, day. A rusty Beetle rolls up to the front security gate, stops, and lets out some passengers, then rolls away. Stan and Kenny remain.
Stan
Thank you. [looks over his Map To The Stars' Homes] This must be the place. [they walk through a side door right under a guard's nose. He fails to notice them. They walk up the driveway and past the massive fountain] Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. [rings the doorbell. The door opens and Mel appears]
Mel
Yes?
Stan
Oh, hi, uh, my name is Stan, and this is Kenny.
Kenny
(Hello.)
Stan
Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
Mel
You can't not like The Passion! I just followed the Bible! Christ died for you. Go home. [leaves, but the boys follow him in.]
Mel Gibson's mansion, inside.
Stan
Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
Mel
Oh yeah? Well you're gonna have to find it first. [unbuttons his shirt] But I won't tell you where I keep my money. [takes off his shirt] You can torture me all you want, I still won't tell you!
Stan
Tor- torture you?
Mel
[removes his pants and socks] Ha! So you do intend to torture me, huh?! [runs up to a torture rack and lies down in it] Well go ahead! Do your worst! [shackles himself in] You still won't get your ticket money back! I can take whatever you can dish out!
Stan
We don't want to torture you.
Mel
I get it, but you don't have a choice, is that it?! Well go ahead! I just sure hope you don't use those whips over there on the wall!
Stan
Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
Mel
[unshackles himself and walks up to the boys] I have to use that money to build my church! I brought the fire and brimstone back to Christianity with The Passion and now I'm gonna start my own church! And do you know why?! So I can play banjo! [whips out a hat and banjo, puts on the hat, and starts playing] Jesus, oh how I love ya, how I love ya Jesus!
Stan
Dude, this guy is freakin' daffy!
Mel
How dare you call me crazy! This means war! [jumps up and whoops like an Indian, twirls around a few times, and fires off blanks at the boys. Stan and Kenny run]
South Park Church, rectory. Fr. Maxi sits at his desk explaining things to Kyle.
Father Maxi
And so it was that God sent his only son down from heaven, to die for our sins.
Kyle
Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
Father Maxi
...What is troubling you, my child?
Kyle
Well, I have this friend, see? And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.
Father Maxi
Ah! You mean he's a Jew!
Kyle
Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
Father Maxi
Yes, The Passion is very powerful. The truth is, there's not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.
Kyle
But how can the Jews make it better??
Father Maxi
Well, if you really care about your friend's soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus. Remember: Christianity is about atonement.
Kyle
Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course. [gets off the chair] I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. [turns and walks out]
Back at Mel's mansion, Stan and Kenny are still running from Mel, who's chasing after them in a cartoonish way. Mel passes a mirror, then gets back to it a second later.
Stan and Kenny
Aaaah!
Mel
Two days ago, I saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker. You wanna get outta here? Talk to me. [resumes hopping like a mad rabbit]
Stan
Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude! [catches a glimpse of a wallet on a table] Wait! There's his wallet! [runs up to it with Kenny]
Mel
Freedom! [Stan grabs the wallet and rifles through it]
Stan
Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? [Kenny hands Stan $2]
Mel
Jesus is Lord! [Stan puts the $2 in and takes out $20]
Stan
All right, let's get the hell out of here! [heads for the doors and opens one. Mel dances in wearing a Carmen Miranda outfit. Stan and Kenny head for another pair of doors. Stan opens it and Mel enters dressed as a clown]
Mel
When you're a clown, nobody takes you seriously!
Outside.
Stan
Aah! Run, dude, run!
Mel
[hopping out behind them, in Braveheart face paint and wielding a sword] K'plagh! K'plagh! And good evening, frieeeeeeends!
The Bijou, day. A large cross is erected atop the Bijou sign. A crowd gathers and acclaims it.
Cartman
One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message! [some applause] Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world! [the crowd applauds] Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
Ticket Salesman
Woah! Great idea!
Man 3
It'll be like a parade!
Man 4
Good idea!
Cartman
And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say "Es ist Zeit für Säuberung," you all chant back "Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten."
Elise
Well, what does that mean, dear?
Jack
Oh, I think it's Aramaic. You know, like in the movie.
Ticket Salesman
Ooo, Aramaic. Cool.
Townsfolk
Neato! That'll be awesome. Great!
Jack
What was our Aramaic line again?
Cartman
[pounds the table a few times] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets messed up from the impacts]
Townsfolk
[repeats, gaining confidence with each syllable] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Cartman
Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
Townsfolk
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Elise
Oh, this is fun! [smiles]
Cartman
[picks a mark in front of the crowd] All right, everyone! Forward, march! [they all move forward] Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Townsfolk
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Cartman
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Townsfolk
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.
Cartman
Nice.
A synagogue. A service is going on, and the synagogue is full.
Rabbi
Shalom hak nak shalom. And now one of our fine young shlokas, Kyle Broflovski, has asked if he could speak to the congregation. [Kyle approaches the lectern]
Kyle
Thank you, rabbi. [Sheila smiles and gets Gerald's attention. Kyle clears his throat.] In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
Man 4
What? [others murmur their shock]
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat?!
Kyle
If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
Man 5
Oh my God! [the other congregants groan]
Gerald
Kyle, what on earth has gotten into you?!
Kyle
I saw The Passion!
Man 6
Oh no! The Passion?! [others murmur]
Man 7
This proves the anti-Semitic effect that movie is having!
Man 8
Yeah, it makes Jews into stereotypes.
Man 9
Stereotyping Jews is terrible.
Woman 4
Something must be done to stop that movie!
Rabbi
Now, now, everyone calm down. We live in a rational community, and everyone knows this is just a movie. There's no cause for alarm.
Mob
[from outside] Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
Cartman
[from outside] Es ist Zeit für Rache! [congregants rise and face the doors in the back, others look out the windows. They see Cartman leading a march past the synagogue]
Mob
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!
Cartman
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
Mob
Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten! [the rabbi and his congregants look on, confused]
Cartman
Es ist Zeit für Rache!
The southwest, desert territory. A tour bus heads east, with Stan and Kenny riding inside.
Stan
Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson. [net loss, sixty-nine dollars] But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
Kenny
(Yeah. I agree.) [a truck horn blows and Stan stands to see who it is. Kenny joins him]
Stan
Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. [Mel Gibson closes in fast in his Mad Max gas truck and wearing Braveheart face paint]
Mel
Give me back my money! [blows his horn again]
Stan
Goddamn, that guy's crazy. [hops off his seat and runs up to the driver] Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
Driver
Huh?
Stan
Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
Driver
Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.
Stan
I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- [Mel plows into the bus, making both vehicles screech. The riders sway in their seats]
Driver
What the hell?
Mel
[shaking his fist in the air] Haaaa! K'Plaaaa!
Driver
Hey! That's Mel Gibson!
Stan
Yeah. I told you that!
Driver
Well, what the hell does he want?!
Stan
He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
Driver
You didn't like The Passion? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. [Mel rams into them again]
The Bijou, night. The synagogue's congregation moves quickly down the street towards the theater.
Kyle
[to his parents] Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
Ticket Salesman
Can I help you?
Rabbi
This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater!
Congregants
That's right! Yeah! Remove your movie!
Shlomo
Remove it from the theater? Fat chance!
Man 10
We demand you stop showing it!
Congregants
Yeah! Yeah!
Kyle
[facing the congregants] No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob! [behind him Cartman is seen leading his mob to the theater] The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
Cartman
[points] Juden!
Jack
What's going on here?
Ticket Salesman
They're trying to have The Passion pulled from the theater.
Rabbi
This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!
Man 11
Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man! There's nothing anti-Semitic about it!
Elise
It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.
Rabbi
It's made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!
Jack
Well, maybe you should apologize.
Mob
That's right! What he said.
Woman 5
How dare you?! [the sound of a truck is faintly heard, but gets stronger.]
Kyle
[noticing] Look out!! [The crowds move to the other side of the street as the tour bus skids to a stop just past the theater. Mel Gibson roars into town and crashes into the ticket booth, and his gas truck blows up. The crowds crawl out of their safety places and merge]
Mel
Give me my eighteen dollars!
Cartman
Mel! Gibson! [brightens and approaches him, then grovels at his feet] Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding! [grovels some more] Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
Mel
Ha! [ignores Cartman and walks up to Stan and Kenny] So! You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh? I guess now you're gonna start torturing me! Well! [grabs his nipples and falls on his knees. The crowd steps back as he twists his nipples] Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don't squeeze them anymore!
Ticket Salesman
That's... Mel Gibson?
Jack
H- he's not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.
Mel
[backs up towards a building] Yeah... [grabs a piece of crap from his ass and removes it from his briefs, turns around, and defaces the building] I'll bet you wanna torture me now, don't you?!
Kyle
[joins Stan and Kenny] Dude, what's wrong with him?
Stan
He's koo-koo, dude. He's absolutely out of his mind.
Mel
You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn't you? [gets down on all fours and hoists his ass up] Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!
Kyle
Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
Mel
[rises and walks up to the boys] Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!
Stan
It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
Mel
You can't say my movie sucked, or else you're saying Christianity sucked!
Stan
No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
Jack
You know, he's right, Elise. We shouldn't focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.
Ticket Salesman
Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn't rely on violence to inspire faith.
Cartman
Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
Kyle
Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. [a grinning Mel squats and farts on Cartman, defecating on Cartman]
Mel
Woohoohoo! Woohoohoohoohoo! [hops towards the camera.]
End of The Passion of the Jew

You Got F'd in the A
The True Value parking lot somewhere in South Park, day. The boys are playing with motorized toy cars.
Cartman
Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. [a car goes up a ramp and jumps off]
Kyle
Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. [Stan's car is uncooperative]
Stan
Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. [some kids come up behind Stan]
Kyle
Hey, who are those kids?
Stan and Cartman turn to see. The crew of five approach and stop. Their leader, dressed in grays, steps forth with his boombox and sets it down, presses "Play," and steps back into the crew. A rap begins to play and the crew begins to dance.
Boombox
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!
[brief instrumental]
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance-

OC Leader
Yeah, how you like that y'all! [Stan and his friends merely look on]
OC Member 1
[dressed in red] Let's bring it to these losers.
OC Girl
Aww yeah!
The OC crew leader dances forward and does some gymnastics moves in Stan's face.
OC Leader
Whatchoo got, huh?! You got nothin'!
The OC crew leader does some more moves and steps backwards into his crew.
OC Leader
Damn! You just got served!
His crew agrees with him. Stan and friends don't move. The crew member dressed in red steps forward and dances in Kyle's face.
OC Leader
Aww man!
One of the dancers twirls on his head and ends in a challenge pose.
OC Girl
He got you, dude.
OC Leader
Now that kid is gettin' served!
OC Girl
Uh huh.
The dancer in red stands on his left hand and challenges Kyle with his groin.
OC
Whoa!
The dancer rolls away and stands on his right hand, rolls back and rests on his left side, then dances away.
OC Leader
Aww man, look at them! They know they can't trip to that! [the girl turns the radio off and the dancers turn and walk away.] Yeah! We're outta here!
OC Member 2
[in gray-green, looks left] That was smokin'!
OC Member 1
[looks right] They didn't do nothin'!
OC Member 3
[Asian, turns around] Sorry y'all, but try not to let it sting too bad! [laughs and turns around]
OC Leader
[turns around] You got served! [the others laugh and he turns around] Come on! They had nothin'! Let's go y'all!
OC Member
Come on y'all! [...and they're gone]
Kyle
...What the hell just happened?
Chef's house, later. Stan rings the doorbell.
Chef
[opens up] Oh. Hello there, children!
Stan
Chef, we just got served.
Chef
Oh boy... Well come on inside, children. I'll make you some cocoa.
Chef's house, living room. Chef shows the children to the couch.
Chef
Have a seat, children. Just try to relax and breathe. [the boys sit down] Are you all okay?
Kyle
Yeah.
Chef
All right. Now, where did you get served?
Stan
Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
Chef
Okay okay, relax children. Relax. It's all over now. Just try to calm down and sit tight. [turns around and picks up the phone] I'm gonna call your parents and let them know you're okay. [taps out a number and the phone rings] Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
Stan's house, that night. The family is at the dining table. Sharon brings a large dish over to Stan.
Sharon
Here, Stanley, I made your favorite potato dish. I want you to feel better, okay.
Randy
What's the matter with him?
Sharon
Oh. Stan got served at school today.
Randy
You got served? By who?
Stan
Some, kids from Orange County.
Sharon
Let's not make a big deal out of it.
Randy
So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
Stan
No.
Randy
What? Yo-you got served and just stood there and took it?
Sharon
That was the right thing to do.
Randy
No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.
Stan
But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
Randy
[in low tones] Well then, it's about time you learned! [rises from the table] Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!
Stan
But Dad-
Randy
Now! [walks off]
Stan's house, garage. Stan and Randy are present. Randy is dressed in sweats, Stan is dressed in sweat pants and sleeveless T-shirt. Randy puts a CD into a stereo system.
Randy
All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.
"Achy-Breaky Heart" begins to play, and Randy begins to dance and starts to sing. Stan looks on.
Randy
Come on, Stan.
Stan steps closer and begins to follow Randy's moves.
Randy
...six, seven, eight.
Stan steps out of a slipper, but slips back into it quickly.
South Park, day, Luau's Toys. Stan and his friends exit and walk down the street.
Kyle
Dude, that is a sweet RC car!
Stan
[carrying the car] Yeah, let's go race it right now![they run into the OC kids]
OC Member 2
Well, what we got here?
OC Member 1
It's the white boys that were served yesterday. [they laugh]
OC Leader
You want a little more, homeboys?
Kyle
We're not interested, thanks.
OC Member 1
[steps forth] You're not interested? Not interested in this?
The OC member waits for the boombox to play, then dances in Kyle's face, including a back flip. All of the OC crew members begin to dance.
Boombox
You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.
You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.
I'm on the OC crew and I'm better than you.
You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.
You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare.

Black Man
Oh Lord, look at those moves.
Black Woman
Oooo, they are takin' it out!
Black Man 2
Oh man, they are getting served!
Black Woman 2
Ooooo, it's getting hot out here!
Black Man 3
Have mercy!
The dancers edge closer and closer to the South Park boys.
Others
Oooooo, look at that! Lord! Gettin' served!
The rap music is turned off and the OC crew turns to see who did it. Stan puts in his CD and prepares to serve the OC boys. "Achy Breaky Heart" plays and Stan dances the steps he learned the night before. The crowds behind both groups look on for a while, then begin to cheer Stan on. Chef is walking down the street minding his business, but he looks over at the commotion and his jaw drops.
Kyle
Yeah! Go Stan!
Chef
Oh no! [begins to cross the street] No, stop Stan! You don't know what you're doin'!
The OC crew are speechless. The song ends. Stan looks around and smiles. The OC kids look like they just got served.
Kyle
All right Stan!
Cartman
Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
OC Leader
Wha?
Kyle
Yeah! You got served!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Cartman
Yeah!
Kyle
That's right!
Cartman
All right!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Chef
[arrives] No no no!
OC Leader
Okay. All right. We got served. So now, I guess... It's on.
Stan
What?
OC Member 1
This Saturday! Our top five dancers against your top five dancers! OC Convention Center. It's on!
OC Members
It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
Townsman
[closes his eyes and laments] Oh Lord it's on!
Chef
Oh dammit! I knew that was gonna happen.
OC Member 3
We'll see you Saturday, fools! [the crowd behind the OC crew parts and they leave]
OC Members
Yeah, and you'd better have a lot better dancers with you than those loozas! 'Cause it's on!
OC Members
It's on! It's on! It's on! It's on!
The crowd begins to murmur about Saturday and the competition.
Chef
Stan, what the hell did you dance back for?
Stan
I thought I was supposed to!
Chef
Now you've gotta compete against them in the dance competition on Saturday!
Stan
But why?
Chef
Because if you get served and served them back, then it's on! Don't you know anything??
Stan's house, breakfast nook. Randy is filling out checks for his bills.
Sharon
[enters the kitchen with Stan] Well, nice going, Randy! Really great advice you gave our son here!
Randy
[turns around] What?
Sharon
Those kids showed up to serve Stan again and he danced back!
Randy
So what happened?
Sharon
It's on!
Stan looks helplessly at his father as his mother drags him off. Randy looks on.
OC Convention Center, day. A large screen over the Center says "Bounce" while a sign closer to the viewer says "This Saturday, 7 PM, Orange County VS. South Park, Dance Competition. It's On!!!!" Inside, preparations are made for the competition. On the floor, the OC crew practices its move under their coach's supervision.
Coach
Come on now, keep it tight!
The OC leader and the member in red drop backwards and then spin on their heads, the girl spins on her left hand
Coach
Good. Now watch that timing, drill team!
In the background Randy appears and walks through one of the many doors. The crew finishes with a flourish. The members then congratulate themselves.
OC Member 1
All right!
OC Girl
[stands] All right!
OC Leader
Yeah, bad ass!
OC Member 2
Yeah, that was tight!
Coach
Not bad, kids. Not bad. [Randy approaches]
OC Member 1
Not bad? South Park doesn't stand a chance!
OC Girl
I heard that!
Coach
All right, it was good. But we don't want "good," we want pain!
Randy
Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.
Coach
[turns around] Yeah?
Randy
Hi, uh, my name is Randy Marsh. I'm Stan Marsh's father.
Coach
Oh, so you're the father of the boy who's gonna get f'd in the a on Saturday?
OC Member 3
Dang!
OC Leader
Oooooo!
Randy
Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it- it- it's not on.
Coach
Oh, it's on!
Randy
No, no, no, it's not on.
Coach
Whoo, it's on all right!
Randy
It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.
Coach
[insistent] It's on!
Randy
I'm keeping my son home Saturday. I just came by to let you know so you can... put a stop to all this. Goodbye. [turns around and walks away]
Coach
Hold on a second, clam-head! [catches him and blocks his way] You think you can just roll in here and tell us it's not on when it very clearly is on?! You're just trying to make us not practice, aren't you?! Because you know that your kids are goin' down when my kids give them this! Give me some moves out, Girl T! [the girl turns on the boombox] Check this out! [balances on his left hand and bounces around, then stands up] Yeah! You like that?!
OC Leader
Oooo man! [shakes his head]
OC Member 1
Ohhh Lord!
The coach spins on his back, rises to one hand, flips over, and lands doing the splits, then rises to his feet using an imaginary hook.
OC Leader
Oooo, he is gettin' served! [the girl shakes her head]
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Randy is recovering in a room. He's got breathing tubes in his nose and his eyes are squeezed shut. His friends surround him.
Randy
Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.
Sharon
[enters with Stan] Randy? [rushes to his bedside] Randy, oh my God!
Skeeter
What happened to him, Doctor?
Dr. Doctor
He got served. Worst I've ever seen.
Jimbo
Old fool went down to the OC to try to reason with the other team, and he got served up somethin' fierce.
Chef
Oh Lord...
Randy
[his voice raspy] His dancing was so fast I... couldn't do anything. His moves were... so original, so inventive. [winces] Ungh! Grrgh.
Nurse
[soothing him] Shh. Relax, Mr. Marsh. [Dr. Doctor walks off]
Dr. Doctor
We just got the X-rays back. [walks to a backlit board and points out the injuries] He mostly got served here [a rib] and here [forearm]. But the worst serving was here in the pelvis region. The road to recovery will be a long one.
Jimbo
Boy. You must really wanna take to to those Orange County kids now, huh, Stan?
Skeeter
Are you kiddin'? Stan is probably ready to pounce on them after what they did to his father! [looks over at his dad, then at the other men]
Stan
I, I don't know. He seems all right.
Mr. Garrison
I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!
Randy
Stan? Stan?
Stan
[walks to Randy's bedside] Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.
Randy
Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.
Stan
Okay, good.
Randy
[emphatic] But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. [passes out. The "8 Mile" theme begins to play and the camera closes in on Stan]
Stan
[thinks and then walks off miffed] God dammit!
Loading dock at South Park Elementary, day. Stan walks over and finds the Goths there, as usual. Henrietta reads a book.
Stan
Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
Michael
[with cigarette] Of course we know how to dance.
Stan
Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
Pete
Dance troupe? Please. [leans to one side and whips his hair back into place] We don't dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school. [whips his hair back into place] Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.
Michael
Yeah. [stands up] The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette.
Michael leans his head to the right for two beats, leans it to the left for two beats, leans it to the right for two beats while taking a drag, leans it to the left for two beats, repeats. The red Goth follows suit, then all four Goths dance the same way.
Stan
Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
Pete
[flips his hair back] No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.
Stan
[walks up to the red Goth] Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
Pete
I'm not doin' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.
Henrietta
Yeah. I'm not conforming to some dance-off regulations.
Firkle
I'm not doin' it either. I'm the biggest nonconformist of all.
Michael
I'm such a nonconformist that I'm not going to conform with the rest of you. Okay, I'll do it. [rises and walks over to Stan]
Stan
Great! [they leave together]
Henrietta
Whoa. I think we just got put in our place.
Pete
Yeah. We just got Goth-served.
The neighborhood. Stan and Michael walk down the street.
Stan
All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
Michael
We should go to the arcade. [takes a drag from his cigarette]
Stan
The arcade?
Michael
Yeah. There's this Asian kid name Yao. He's an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game. [takes a drag from his cigarette]
The Sinistarcade. A Dancin' Dancin' Dancin' Machine game is prominently shown, and an Asian boy dances furiously on the foot pad on the right. The arrows indicate which foot buttons the boy should be stepping on. He's hit every one, so his score is perfect. Stan and Michael look on.
Stan
Dude, he's incredible.
Michael
He should be. He's here playing that game every single day after school. I think he's spent about six thousand dollars on it so far. [the game gets faster and faster and the kid keeps up. Eventually the game ends, the boy picks up his soda cup and walks away.]
Stan
[catches up to Yao at the change machine] Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
Yao
You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?
Stan
Yeah.
Yao
That's stupid. [waves him off and walks away]
Stan
[catches up] Dude, we need you.
Yao
I can't dance without the machine.
Stan
It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
Yao
Okay. I'll give it a shot.
Stan
All right, that's three!
Michael
Dude, we need a girl.
Stan
Huh?
Michael
We can't be a dance troupe with just guys. People will think we're fags.
Stan
Oh yeah. [thinks a bit with finger to chin] Wait a minute. I know just where to go!
Raisins. Happy Hour all day!!! Inside the little waitresses go about their work. Two of them dance, shaking their asses in rhythmic unison. Mercedes dances for a boy, who looks on in bliss.
Porsche
Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?
Stan
Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.
Maury
You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls. [Stan look at his crew. Moments later they are seated at the bar, with Mercedes]
Stan
And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
Mercedes
[twirling her hair] Wow, that sounds great. I always wanted to try my dancing somewhere else.
Stan
So you'll do it?
Mercedes
Why not?
Stan
All right, we just need one more person!
Mercedes
Hey, we should get that kid that was state champion in tap dancing.
Stan
What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
Mercedes
I think his name was... [closes her eyes] Leopold... Stotch or something?
Stan
Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
Butters' house, day. He's at the kitchen assembling a toy car.
Butters
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
Linda
[enters] Butters, you have some visitors. [Stan, Michael, Mercedes, and Yao appear]
Butters
[turns around] Oh well, hi there everybody. [his mom leaves]
Stan
Butters, listen. There's gonna be a competition this Saturday, and we want you to join our troupe.
Butters
Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
Stan
It's a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. [his smile vanishes as he begins to think back, then a small grimace appears.]
Butters
...No.
Stan
But, you were, weren't you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.
Butters
No. [hops off the chair and runs away] No no no no no no, no! [runs into the living room and up the stairs] No! No no no no!
Linda
Butters? [rises and looks up the stairs] Butters?! [Stan and the other kids enter]
Stan
We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
Linda
Oh. Oh dear. I'm sorry kids, it's just that... Butters hasn't danced since the tragedy.
Mercedes
A tragedy?
Butters
[from his room] Waaaaah!
Linda
I'm sorry, kids, you'll have to go.
Outside. The kids leave Butters' house and make their way to the sidewalk.
Stan
Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
Yao
Hey I heard about this guy in Como who has a duck that can dance.
Stan
A duck? Dude, don't be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there's gotta be one other talented person in South Park.
Butters' house, Butters' bedroom closer door slides open and he looks in. On the floor, covered in cobwebs and underneath some clothes is an orange shoe box with red lid. Butters slides the door open more and reaches in. He pulls out the box and sets it on his bed. He sits down next to it, nervously. Butters opens the box and pulls out news clippings: "Local Boy Taps His Way to the Finals" "Best in State Arrive in Lincoln" "Eight Dead as Finalist Loses Step" "Biggest Tap Tragedy since 1954". He then removes some tissue from the tap shoes, then removes a shoe. He inspects it until he sees the blood on the side of the shoe.
Butters
Aaaaah! [quickly throws the shoes and clippings away, then goes to cry into his pillow] Aaaaah!
A ranch. Stan and his troupe arrive.
Stan
All right, so you're sure he can dance?
Rancher
Oh yeah. There he is. That's Jeffy.
Yao
That don't look like a dancing duck to me.
Rancher
Well, that's 'cause it needs music. Here y-here ya go, Jeffy.
The rancher brings out a violin and begins playing.
Rancher
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honeeey.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, babe.

The duck rises and begins to dance.
Rancher
 You'll do a line and I'll do a line, we'll fight an' screw 'til the mornin' time.
Honey, babe, be mine.
You'll do a line and I'll do a line, honey-

Stan
Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
Rancher
No no, he'll dance to anything. See?
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, honeeey.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, babe.
You'll snort K and I'll snort K, we'll fight an' screw all night and day.
Honey, babe, be mine.

Stan
My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
Butters' house, day. Linda walks up the stairs to Butters' room and knocks on the door.
Linda
Butters? Butters? Come on, sweetie, it's gonna be okay. [a shot of Butters under the covers, with bug eyes] Come on, Butters. You went through a lot of therapy for this. That was almost two years ago, sweetie.
Butters
Two years ago. Two years ago!
The camera goes into Butters' eye and a memory of the finals two years prior comes up. A girl dances, finishes, and takes several curtsies.
Announcer
That was Beverly Long from Indianapolis, folks. Let her hear it! [she waves to the audience and walks off] All right, and now, dancing to the song "I've Got Something In My Front Pocket For You," here is Colorado state champion, Leopold "Butters" Stotch! [the audience applauds. The Stotches are present and clapping with the audience. The song begins to play, Butters begins to dance]
Singer
I've got something in my front pocket for you
Why don't you reach down in my pocket and see what it is
Then grab onto it, it's just for you
Give a little squeeze and say, "How do you do?"
There's something in my front pocket, There's something in my front pocket,
There's something in my front pocket-

As the song reaches its climax, he dances faster and faster, until his right shoe flies off his foot.
Butters
Whoops.
Butters' shoe strikes a floodlight in the rafters and knocks it down. The light lands on a man, instantly killing him. Blood splatters onto the surrounding audience members, who get up and scatter. The rafters begin to break apart. A pole comes down and impales a fleeing woman. Her flying blood reaches Butters. More lights fall down and a cable is torn from its anchor, leaving a hole in the wall. The cable swings down and slices a couple in two along the abdomen. The upper halves of their bodies slide off and fall to the ground.
Woman
Paul. Paul!
The woman grabs onto the stage light and is electrocuted. Another man, who was sliced in two by the cable, attempts to gather his insides back into himself. The rafters come down and kill another man, and Paul's widow finally blows up. More blood lands on Butters, and the crowd begins to panic.
Butters
Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! [a man is trampled to death underfoot. Butters watches the auditorium empty out] No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!
South Park, day. Chef approaches Lamont's Dance Studio with his boombox and duffle bag.
Chef
All right, children, let's get to rehearsin'! [sets his stuff onto a table next to the door] We don't have much time, and you've got to become the dance group you can be. [moves further into the studio] I think we should- [stops] Whoa. [a shot of the five dancers, including Jeffy, who quacks] This... is the dance troupe?
Stan
Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
Chef
Oh boy. [returns to his boombox] All right, well, why don't you show me what you got? I wanna see what you kids can do!
Chef starts the CD player. The troupe members display their moves: Stan with the Achy Breaky Dance, Michael with the hanging head, Yao with his DDDM moves, Mercedes with her rump shaker, Jeffy with his duck strut.
Boombox
You can't step to my roots, so don't try it.
You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.
I'm on the East-side crew and I'm better than you.
You like to suck my balls, don't deny it.
You can't bop her like me so don't go there.
You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.
I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.
I'm a good listener and that's rare.

Chef
Oh Lord have mercy. [turns off the boombox] Children, children! No no, you've got it all wrong. Don't you see, children? You have the heart, but you don't have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don't have the heart. [scratches his head] No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don't have the talent.
Stan
We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
Yao
What? I don't wanna get served.
Mercedes
Yeah, you didn't tell us that we might get served.
Stan
Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- [the others also speak, the others continue to argue, talking over one another.]
Chef
All right all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody's getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. [Stan droops his head.]
Butters' room. He's working on a Lego building, which might be a model of South Park. Stan enters and walks up to him. Butters glances back and then looks at his work again.
Butters
What do you want?
Stan
I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don't think we have any kind of shot without you.
Butters
Sorry, Stan, I'm not a dancer anymore. [leaves his chair and walks up to his Lego box] I gave that up.
Stan
Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
Butters
[rummaging for Lego blocks to take back to his desk] Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
Stan
Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault.
Butters
Yeah well, you tell that to their families. [returns to his desk with a new batch of blocks]
Stan
Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
Butters
[whirls around] I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
Stan
Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
Butters
What?
Stan
And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
Butters
[cups his hear so he hears no more] Aaaah!
Stan
But that isn't the point, Butters! [Butters resumes building his tiny town] The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I'm better than you!" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
Butters
Get out of my room, Stan.
Stan
[Firmly] Fine. [walks to the door and opens it] But someday you're gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. [leaves and closes the door. Butters, angered, tosses some blocks into his town, then wipes the town off the desk.]
The OC Convention Center. "It's ON!!!! NOW!!!!".
MC
Yeah, make some noise!
The audience cheers. The OC side is shown, then the SP side. The Blacks, Jimbo, Ned, Skeeter, and Mr. Garrison are in that audience. The South Park crew is then shown with Chef
MC
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Marshes are shown, Randy with his portable oxygen tank and wheelchair.
MC
man, you are all in for a treat! Whichever crew wins tonight, you wanna remember their faces, 'cause the next time you see them... will be in Lil Kim's next video! Give it up for Lil Kim!
A tiny Lil Kim is shown seated on a table. Her lips and breasts are waaaay too big for her infant-sized body.
Lil Kim
[high squeaky voice] What's up, niggaz?! [waves to the audience]
MC
This is gonna be a rough battle, y'all. So let's give it up for the OC Crew! [the crew is shown, then their parents in the audience are shown] And the challengers, the South Park Diggitys!
Jimbo
Man, it is about to get crazy up in here.
Mr. Garrison
Aww, yeah.
MC
A'ight y'all. It's showtime!
Announcer
Dancers to the floor! [the OC Crew steps forth]
Mercedes
[runs up to Stan] Stan. Stan, we have a big problem!
Stan
What?
Mercedes
It's Jeffy. He sprained his ankle.
Jeffy the duck has an ice pack on his ankle. The rest of the crew approaches.
Stan
What happened??
Mercedes
He was practicing the six-eight count and slipped on the floor.
OC Member 3
Come on, fools! You dancin' or what?!
Yao
Can he move it?
Yao touches the ice pack and Jeffy protests vociferously. Yao removes his hand.
Stan
Aw, what do we do, Chef?!
Chef
Rules are you have to have five dancers. We have no choice, children. We have to forfeit.
OC Member 1
Looks like they ain't even gonna dance.
OC Leader
They're too scared! Looks like they already got served!
The doors at the back of the OCCC open up and Butters appears. Some spectators turn to see who it is, but have a hard time because of the glare behind Butters. The doors close behind him and he walks down the hall towards the dance-off.
Butters
Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
Stan
Butters! [the SP crew moves towards him]
Chef
All right!
MC
All right come on, let's do this! DJ! Give us a hot track!
The DJ starts up a CD. The OC Crew dances first.
CD
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!

The OC leader comes up to Butters and serves him with a balance act on the right hand twice and a back flip, then returns to the crew, spins on his head a few times, then ends on his side, resting his head on his right hand.
CD
Let's see you...! Let's see you...!
Daaance, sucka!

The music begins a brief instrumental. The Diggitys answer the serve with a sequence that has the members twirling and handing off to the next one until all point to Butters. He then steps forth tap-dancing. He dances well, but his dancing gets intense quickly.
CD
Let's see you daaance, sucka! You've got nothin' on me!
Let's see you dance sucka!

Butters' intensity is so great that his left shoe flies off his foot and sails into the rafters.
Butters
Waaah! [the spectators follow the shoe's arc. The shoe hits a stage light, which comes down and kills the OC leader. The OC coach comes forward] No! Jesus, not again!
OC Member 1
Aaaah!
OC Member 3
Get out of here!
The rafters come down on the rest of the crew, including the coach, killing them instantly. Butters and the spectators are mortified at these developments.
MC
[walks up, sadly] Folks, it looks like the OC crew is dead. [excitedly] That means the winner is the South Park Diggitys!
Skeeter
Woo!
Mr. Garrison
Yeah!
Jimbo
All right!
Chef
All right! We did it! [he and the Diggitys approach Butters]
Stan
All right Butters!
Yao
You did it!
Randy
You did it, son! You did it!
Cartman
All right, Butters!
The people who arrive to congratulate Butters: Cartman, Kenny, Kyle, Mr. Garrison, Jimbo, Liane, Token and his parents, Ned, Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mayor McDaniels. Stan and Cartman hoist Butters up between them and walk towards the camera. The others follow. Butters' mouth fills the screen.
Butters
No! No! Noooooo!
End of You Got F'd in the A

AWESOM-O
Butters' house, day. Butters is in the living room eating some soup. The doorbell rings. Butters stops and looks at the door. He rises and opens it, and sees a large wooden crate waiting on the porch.
Butters
What the heck?
Butters steps outside to look for the address label.
Butters
Whoa! What a huge package! [finds it, the shipping label reads]
Butters
To Butters Stotch. Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me! [returns to the crate's label]
Butters
Who is it from? "Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa." [skips around] Wow! A package for me from Japan!!
Butters pushes the crate into the house.
Butters
Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.
Butters skips around and runs into the house. He returns with a small crowbar.
Butters
Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package.
Butters tugs at the panel he loosened. The panel swings down and Butters flies off. He lays on his back and looks up. A large A.W.E.S.O.M.- O., wide enough to resemble Cartman, walks out of the crate.
Cartman
[monotone] Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
Butters
[dazzled] Whoa...
Cartman
I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
Butters
[approaches AWESOM-O] You... you're my robot?
Cartman
Yes. I will be your new best friend.
Butters
Oh wow!
Moments later, Butters has Cartman sitting on his bed. Butters goes to his desk and makes a few calls.
Butters
Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.
Cartman snickers to himself
Butters
Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.
Butters hangs up, takes the phone back to his bedside table and sets the phone down.
Butters
Heheh, they're all so jealous! [He hops onto the bed next to Cartman.] I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
Cartman
Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
Butters
Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh? [strokes his chin] Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesitated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
Cartman
[snickers] Really?
Butters
Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school. [Cartman begins to chuckle] You okay, AWESOM-O?
Cartman
Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
Butters
Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
Cartman
[laughs] That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
Butters
Hm, okay. Let's see [strokes his chin] Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
Cartman
Oh, really?
Butters
Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
Cartman
Heh. Wow, that sucks.
Butters
Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
Cartman
Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
Butters
No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! [hops off and walks towards his desk.]
Cartman
Really? You think so? Well, guess what, Butters. I have a surprise for you.
Butters
Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
Cartman
What?
Butters
When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
Cartman
You saw that?
Butters
Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
Cartman
Nuh uh.
Butters
I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
Cartman
No way.
Butters
Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
Cartman
[beat] ...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
Butters
Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
Cartman
Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
Butters
How come?
Cartman
Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
Butters
Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. [leaves the room]
Cartman
[moments later, still on the bed] Oh, son of a bitch!
Montage. Butters tosses a basketball with Cartman on the front lawn. Cartman, as AWESOM-O, can't catch it.
Butters
Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?

They're walking along in a meadow. Butters is telling him a story.
Butters
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.

Butters has AWESOM-O take shots at a basketball hoop. The shot is good and Butters is pleased.
Butters
My robot friend.

Stan, Kyle and Kenny observe nearby from behind a bush. They're dismayed at what they see. Stan pinches his nose and shuts his eyes in frustration, then walks off. Kyle and Kenny follow.
Butters
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.

Butters jumps in a puddle, then has AWESOM-O do the same. Butters giggles.
Butters
He's smart as can be and emotion-free

Butters washes dishes while AWESOM-O dries them, then they go see "The Prince and Me." They exit, with Butters skipping beside AWESOM-O.
Butters
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.

At a restaurant two burgers reach Butters' table. He gets one, he motions to the waiter that AWESOM-O doesn't need the other one. The waiter looks confused, then walks away with the other burger.
Butters
My robot friend.

Butters has AWESOM-O pull him along in a red wagon.
Butters
My robot friend.

They walk into a sunset together.
Butters
My robot... friend.

Butters' house, living room. His dad reads the newspaper, his mom arrives with coffee and cookies and sets them down on the coffee table.
Linda
Oohhh, that's so cute. Did you see Butters and his friend Eric playing Robot.
Stephen
[tosses the paper onto the couch arm as Linda serves him coffee] Yes. Those boys are quite imaginative. Leave it to them to find a fun way to do the dishes. [takes his cup]
Butters
[leading Cartman to the stairs] That's great AWESOM-O! [Cartman carries a pile of clothes] You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
Linda
Ah, Butters, it's getting late. You should be getting ready for bed soon.
Butters
Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.
Linda
Oh, is your little robot friend staying the night?
Butters
Well of course he is. He's my robot, ain't he?
Linda
That's okay with your mom, Mr. Robot?
Cartman
AWESOM-O does not have a mom.
Butters
Yeah! Don't you know nothin' about robots? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! [Cartman follows Butters upstairs]
Linda
Aw, that's just adorable.
Stephen
It's good to see Butters finally have a friend that wants to stay over.
The Stotch bathroom. Butters is brushing his teeth, AWESOM-O stands next to him.
Butters
I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!

Cartman
[under his breath] Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this. [normal. Butters opens up the medicine cabinet] Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
Butters
Oh. Yeah.
Cartman
I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
Butters
[turns around carrying a box of suppositories] Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository. [takes one out and puts the box on the cabinet] Can you help me?
Cartman
What?
Butters
Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
Cartman
Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
Butters
[hops down from the stool] Haw, it's real easy. I'll show you. You just take this little thingy out of the plastic... paper, and I'll, I'll pull down my pants ...and just slide it up in my anus there.
Cartman
...No way.
Butters
AWESOM-O, I though you were programmed to do whatever I tell you.
Cartman
Weak! [turns right and faces Butters' ass.]
Butters
Ye- yeah, that, that's pretty good. Get it up there good and deep.
Cartman
Lame!
Butters' house, moments later.
Butters
All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep. [POV changes from outside to bedroom overhead] Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
Cartman
AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
Butters
Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye, [turns off the light] or what, or whatever robots have.
Butters closes his eyes and drifts off to sleep. He turns to his left and places a hand on AWESOM-O.
Morning. A cock crows. Butters wakes up, but AWESOM-O isn't in bed with him. He looks around and sees his room is a mess. His drawers are out of the dressers and his clothes are strewn all over the place. One of his clothing rods has been knocked down and his closet doors are open. AWESOM-O is shown at Butters' desk looking through more stuff.
Cartman
Where is it? Where is it?!
Butters
AWESOM-O?!
Cartman
Wah!
Butters
AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
Cartman
Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
Butters
Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
Cartman
AWESOM-O understands.
Butters
Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!
Three spankings follow, but as they are done against the robot frame, they are ineffective.
Butters
Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
Cartman
Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
Butters' house, downstairs. Butters is drawing a picture at the coffee table.
Butters
Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together. [Butters and AWESOM-O are walking in a field] Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. [walks off]
Cartman
I would like some Sunny Delight too.
Butters
[tickled] Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'. [tickled, turns away] Uh, heehee. [the doorbell rings] Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
Cartman
[turns] AWESOM-O will answers the door. [walks towards the door as Butters leaves and opens it. He sees Stan, Kyle, and Kenny]
Kyle
What the hell are you doing, fatass?
Stan
Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
Cartman
[normal voice] Shh! [lifts up the helmet part of the outfit] I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
Kyle
Why?
Cartman
Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
Kyle
Why?
Cartman
Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
Butters
[appears behind Cartman holding his glass of Sunny Delight] Who's at the door, AWESOM-O?
Cartman turns around, then adjusts his helmet.
Cartman
[monotone] Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
Butters
Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
Stan
Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.
Butters
Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. [Stan, Kyle, and Kenny quickly look to Cartman]
Cartman
Weak.
Butters
He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
Cartman
Yes, of course. [begins to walk towards the kitchen]
Kyle
Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O, [Cartman stops] I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
Cartman
Suck my balls, Kyle. [resumes his walk]
Butters
[cheerfully] He's made in Japan!
The dining room. Stephen holds a cup of coffee and listens as Linda talks to Liane.
Linda
Yes, it has just been a delight having your son over, Mrs. Cartman. He and Butters are really getting along great.
Liane
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Mrs. Stotch. Eric has been having some emotional problems lately.
Linda
Well, the reason I'm calling is that Butters is supposed to go see his Aunt Nellie in Los Angeles this weekend. The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.
Liane
Oh, well, I'm not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.
Linda
[Stephen takes a sip] Excuse me, I didn't catch that.
Liane
Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him. Yes, of course he can go. I'll bring some of clothes over.
Linda
Oh, wonderful! The boys will be so excited.
The kitchen. AWESOM-O rummages around under the sink.
Cartman
Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
Butters
[enters] AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! [Cartman moves to the refrigerator, Stephen and Liane enter]
Linda
Hey guys, great news! It's been arranged, you two are both going to Los Angeles to visit Butters' Aunt Nellie!
Butters
[overjoyed] Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
Cartman
What?
Butters
Oh boy, [shakes Cartman's hand] AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! [hugs the "robot"]
Cartman
Lame.
Los Angeles, day. The Hollywood sign appears in the background.
Aunt Nellie's house.
Uncle Budd
Hey Nellie, guess what I found scrampin' around the airport. [Butters enters in a suit]
Butters
Hi Aunt Nellie! [runs up to her and they hug each other]
Aunt Nellie
There's my little nephew! How was your flight? [they let go of each other]
Butters
It was long. We had a three-hour delay... departin' Denver, but we're here!
Aunt Nellie
Didn't ya bring any bags?
Butters
Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
Aunt Nellie
Your robot?
Uncle Budd
Butters' new friend is a little strange. He, he really takes playing Robot seriously.
Cartman walks in mechanically with all the luggage.
Butters
There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. [Cartman drops the suitcases]
Aunt Nellie
Hello! It's nice to have you here.
Cartman
AWESOM-O must dispense oil waste. Where is the nearest toilet, please?
Aunt Nellie
Oh oh, right through there, Mr. Robot.
Cartman
Thank you. [walks in the direction Aunt Nellie points to]
Uncle Budd
I don't think he took the costume off the entire trip.
Aunt Nellie
Well, did you wanna get right to sight-seeing, or are you guys hungry after such a long flight.
Butters
Nah, I ate on the plane. And AWESOM-O is a robot, so he don't need to eat.
Aunt Nellie
Right...
Aunt Nellie's restroom. Cartman runs in frantically and takes off the helmet. His hair is matted against his head and he gasps for air. He runs up to the sink and reaches... for the toothpaste. He squeezes the tube and sucks out the contents hungrily.
Butters
[knocks on the door] AWESOM-O?
Cartman
Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. [finishes off the tube, hops down, and tosses the tube aside]
Butters
Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go sightseein'!
Cartman
Argh! [heads out.]
Montage. Hollywood Boulevard, facing the Chinese Theater. The Passion is playing there. Butters takes a picture of AWESOM-O next to the cemented hand- and footprints of the stars. Next, he and AWESOM-O ride down a log in an amusement park. Next, he and AWESOM-O are in a plane ride together. Next, AWESOM-O rubs some suntan lotion on Butters' back. Next, he and AWESOM-O take part in a Galaxy Studios Tour ride. A shark pops up and roars menacingly at the riders. Next, Catamount Pictures is shown.
Butters
 I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind-
That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.

Catamount Pictures. Butters and Cartman walk around. Cartman carries the bags.
Butters
Can you believe we're at a real live movie studio, AWESOM-O? Aren't we havin' the best time?!
Cartman
Butters, wouldn't you like to have some time away from AWESOM-O? We could meet up later, perhaps?
Butters
Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary. [Le Catamount Bistró] That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? [moves off]
Le Catamount Bistró, Two producers talk.
Producer
[as the other producer eats] Damnit, Mitch. How come our movie studio can't come up with any winners? I mean, we're smart, right?
Mitch
[the bald producer] We're really smart.
Producer
We need an idea for a movie that's a home run. A feel-good romp for the whole family. [notices something and points] Hey, what's that over there? [Mitch looks over his shoulder. The camera looks at Butters and AWESOM-O attracting a crowd]
Woman
Wow, that's a really neat little robot you have there, little boy.
Girl
What's he do?
Butters
Well, he can do anything. Watch this: Hey, AWESOM-O, who's gonna win the Super Bowl next year?
Cartman
The New Orleans Saints. [everyone around them laughs, and the producers approach]
Boy
Hey, Mr. Robot, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Cartman
Seventeen. [everyone laughs again]
Producer
Mitch, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Mitch
[strokes his chin] Yeah. Maybe that robot can be programmed to come up with movie ideas! [smiles]
Producer
[looks at him intently] Exactly! [smiles]
Catamount Pictures boardroom. The producer introduces Butters and AWESOM-O to his staff.
Producer
Gentlemen, this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot. The AWESOM-O 4000. [approaches the robot, who's seated at one end of the table] I've already seen what it can do.
Staffer 1
Uh, excuse me sir, but uh, that's not a robot.
Producer
It's not?
Staffer 1
No, it clearly had bipedal movement, so the correct term is "computerized automatron."
Mitch
Oh, very nice, Mitch.
Staffer 2
You are the smart one.
Producer
Well, regardless, I believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas.
Staffer 2
How can a robot come up with better ideas for movies than us?
Producer
Watch this: AWESOM-O, given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office?
Cartman
Um... okay. How about this: [the staffers take pen to paper and anticipate the ideas] Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
Staffer 2
[thinking over this idea, then write it down] Oh, perfect!
Staffer 3
We'll call it "Puppy Love"!
Staffer 2
Give us another movie idea, AWESOM-O!
Mitch
Yeah, yeah!
Staffer 3
Let's hear it!
Mitch
Yeah, we wanna hear it!
Staffer 3
Come on, come on!
Cartman
Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
Staffer 3
[the producers start writing again]... Yes, it's flawless!
Mitch
Punch-Drunk Billionaire!
Aunt Nellie's house, guest room. Butters is at the desk counting up all the movie he and AWESOM-O got for Cartman's ideas and putting one hundred dollar bills one per envelope.
Butters
Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
Cartman
You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
Butters
Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
Cartman
[growing desperate, walks around] Haaaa! Haaaa!
Butters
[concerned] You, you okay AWESOM-O?
Cartman
AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
Butters
Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
Washington DC, the Pentagon.
The Pentagon, a boardroom. A general addresses his peers.
General
Gentlemen, Ladies, we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty. The risk of an attack on American soil is higher than ever. Now, I believe we may be able to curb that risk. Two days ago our intelligence department came across this.
He turns around and faces a wall of TV screens. His peers turn to look. He then turns the screens on. Images of AWESOM-O, taken from various angles, pop up.
General
The AWESOM-O 4000. It is currently being used by Catamount Pictures to develop ideas for movies. Our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas, eight hundred of which feature Adam Sandler. [the officers murmur amongst themselves]
Black Official
That's incredible!
White Official
You're thinking the robot could be used to come up with anti-Islamic movies?
General
No. If we got our hands on that robot, we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon!
Black Official
Yes, that might be the best thing to do.
White Official
Uh huh. I don't see how we have a choice.
Scientist
Hold on a second: If that robot is designed for entertainment, then, turning it into a weapon is unethical.
General
Unethical? Let me explain something to you, Mr. Scientist! We understand that the robot is from Japan! That means that the Japanese have more of them! And if the Japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do...
Black Official
Jesus. It would be Pearl Harbor all over again.
White Official
But worse. With robots.
Scientist
I'm sorry, I must protest. We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability.
General
You're paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub. [the scientist sits back down.] Gentlemen, we're going to Los Angeles! [zoom in] I want that robot!
Catamount Pictures lobby. Butters places a call.
Butters
Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
The boardroom. Cartman is pitching more movie ideas.
Cartman
Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
Producer
Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.
The other men rise and leave the room, making plans for lunch on the way out. The producer approaches Cartman.
Producer
You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?
Cartman
...What?
Producer
Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?
Cartman
AWESOM-O does not understand.
Producer
Let me show you what I mean. [removes his tie]
Catamount Pictures lobby.
Butters
Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
Cartman
[from the boardroom] Lame!
Butters
Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either.
The boardroom doors burst open and AWESOM-O runs out.
Cartman
Not cool! Totally lame! [runs to his left. Butters looks over his shoulder]
Butters
AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction. [hangs up and goes after AWESOM-O.] AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go?
Butters looks left, then right, then goes to the right, exiting the scene. Moments later the producer shows up at the doorway with his pants down.
Cartman
Waaaaa!
A cattle prod appears and shocks him until he falls over. A dolly then appears and two soldiers quickly put Cartman on it and haul him off.
Soldier
Let's go! Move, move!
Butters
[appears around the corner] AWESOM-O? [notices the soldiers] Hey, what are you doin' with him?!
The soldiers exit some side doors and toss him into the back of a waiting van. Butters exits the side door.
Butters
That's my robot! [the soldiers get into the van and drive off] AWESOM-OOOOOOOO!!!
A military base near Los Angeles. In a warehouse, AWESOM-O, shackled onto a platform, is raised from a horizontal position to vertical. Two soldiers approach on either side of Cartman and tighten the locks on him.
General
Are those arm and leg locks secure?
Soldier
Secure, sir!
General
Good. I don't want that robot mobile until I know what it's capable of. All right, power it on. [the scientist turns a drill on and approaches AWESOM-O]
Cartman
Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!
Scientist
[steps back surprised] What the hell?
General
What's going on?
Scientist
[in disbelief] It... powered itself back on.
General
[whispers to a soldier to his left] Stand by. Be ready to destroy it.
The soldier cocks his semiautomatic and aims at Cartman.
Cartman
Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
Scientist
Are your systems stable? Run a systems check on your CPU.
Cartman
The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
Scientist
Ah, I'm sorry, robot, [in a low voice, almost a whisper] they want me to reprogram you.
Cartman
I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!
Scientist
What did you say?
Cartman
I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
Scientist
[stunned] ...Oh my God. [turns around and approaches the military]
General
What's happening?
Scientist
The robot... It thinks it's alive. It's developed consciousness.
General
What? How can that be?
Scientist
Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the... interlaced BV system.
General
Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist!
Scientist
Your robot doesn't know it's a robot!
Cartman
Goddamnit, get me down from here! [the military approaches him]
General
Who made you, robot?
Cartman
[enunciating] I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
White Official
[the military turns around] Jesus, the scientist was right.
General
But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?
Cartman
Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
General
[faces Cartman] Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too.
Scientist
Sure, why not? Program the memories of some eight-year-old boy who doesn't exist, and make the robot think he's real! Makes for a lot better movies! I'm not reprogramming a robot that's developed consciousness!
General
Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don't forget you have a duty to your country, [draws out the next few syllables] Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot's memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?! [the military leaves him to his work.]
Scientist
Damn you all to hell!
Los Angeles. Butters walks down a sidewalk alone with his head down.
Butters
[voiceover, sadly]
Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.

Butters
[realizing something] Hey, wait a minute. [sees the van that took AWESOM-O away] Why, that's the van that- [tuns towards it] Oh my God!
The military base, warehouse. The scientist has positioned AWESOM-O so his head can be drilled into, and a huge drill bit begins to descend towards him.
Cartman
[fidgets frantically] Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
Soldier
It'll all be over soon, robot!
The scientist scratches his head, then decides to take action. He takes out a vice wrench and smacks the soldier with it, knocking him out. He turns off the drill, tosses the wrench aside and goes to AWESOM-O.
Scientist
Hang on! I'm getting you out of here, robot!
Cartman
Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass!
The General and his men return, Cartman gets off the platform.
General
What the hell are you doing?!
Scientist
[turns around] Well I- I'm saving a conscious being! If you wanna kill it, you'll have to go through me!
General
Fine. Kill that son of a bitch!
Cartman
No! Look, Goddamnit! Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! [raises his helmet enough to show his eyes]
Butters
[enters] AWESOM-O!
The helmet quickly goes down and Cartman becomes a robot again.
Cartman
I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
The soldier fires one shot into the scientist, and the scientist goes down.
Butters
No! [runs up to Cartman] No, please! [hugs him] Don't kill him! He's my best friend! He's my best friend in the whole world!
Butters begins to sob. The military is amazed by this display of affection from a boy towards his robot.
Scientist
[still alive, looks up] There. You see? You want to tell me this isn't humanity? Who's to judge what makes something human anyway?! [pulls out his stomach] Does this make me human?! [pulls out his lung] Or this?! [pulls out his intestines] Or these?! [falls over dead]
General
[approaches AWESOM-O] Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots. I think maybe one day we can all- [Cartman farts, Butters steps back surprised] Hey, wait a minute, did, did that robot just fart?
Butters
Hey, robots don't fart!
Cartman
Uh... now ending fart sequence.
General
Oh, and it, it smells, too!
Cartman
Smell sequence initiated.
Black Official
A robot with smelly farts? That doesn't make any sense.
Butters
Hang on a second, here!
Butters reaches for AWESOM-O's helmet and removes it. The military is taken aback at what they see..
A portable screen is put up inside a room and the videotape of Cartman acting strange in his backyard is being shown. The sound of laughing kids is heard. On the tape, Cartman is dancing around like Britney Spears.
Cartman
[rapping]
Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
[begins dancing with a life-size cutout of Justin Timberlake]
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!

As the video plays, shots are shown of: the fourth graders and the kindergartners, more fourth graders and older students (including Stan, Kyle, and Kenny), Chef, Principal Victoria, Mr. Garrison, other teachers, Butters enjoying himself immensely, the Catamount Pictures producers, the military, then of a fuming Cartman having to suffer it all as everyone laughs.
General
Wow, kid, you're a little faggot!
Cartman
Lame...
End of AWESOM-O

The Jeffersons
The neighborhood. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny ride down the street on their big wheels.
Stan
[stops and looks at a house] Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. [the other boys stop and look.]
Kyle
Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
Cartman
I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. [a door is heard opening]
Kyle
[points] Hey Look!
A young kid wearing an ornate face mask is seen peeking out the front door.
Blanket
Hello!
The boys get off their bikes and approach the kid.
Kyle
Hey. Do you live here?
Blanket
Yeah, I just moved here with my dad. Are you gonna be my new friends?
Cartman
No.
Blanket
I really like your town. My dad wanted to move somewhere to get away from it all. He said he wanted peace and quiet, and to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything.
Stan and Kyle look at each other a bit puzzled.
Stan
What's that you're wearing?
Blanket
It's my mask. My daddy says it's best for me to hide my face. My name's Blanket.
Cartman
Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now.
The boys turn back to get back on to their bikes.
Blanket
Wait! Don't you guys wanna come inside and play?
Cartman
Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. [they turn away.]
Blanket
We have arcade games inside.
Kyle and Cartman whip around. Moments later, the boys are in the house.'
The Jeffersons' house inside.
Blanket
Dad?
Stan
Whoa. Dude, no way!
Cartman
Oh my God, this is awesome! [runs up to a claw machine]
Stan
Dude, are these all your toys?
Blanket
No, this is all my dad's stuff. He loves toys and video games.
Kyle
Dude, he just be loaded! What does he do?
Blanket
He's retired now.
Cartman
[guiding the machine's arm to grab a plush toy] Oh my God, dude! Your dad must be the coolest guy in the world!
Blanket
Come on, my dad's probably out in the backyard. [guides the other three boys out]
The backyard. The sliding door opens up to a small park, a Neverland, with a giraffe, small Ferris wheel, small carousel, and other things. The boys step through the doorway.
Cartman
Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
Blanket
Dad? You out here?
Michael
Here I am, Blanket!
Blanket's dad, a spitting image of Michael Jackson, rides into view on a small train and waves. Every few seconds his moustache falls off and he has to put it back in place. He hops off the train and dances around
Michael
Heeee!
He twirls, does a pelvic thrust while daintily touching his crotch.
Michael
Jeh chabee durtah!
He pulls up his pant legs a bit, kicks his right leg up, then whips his right arm out to full length. His moustache falls off and he resets it, then runs up to Blanket and picks him up
Michael
Blanket! Oh my beautiful blanket!
Kyle
[softly] What's wrong with his face?
Stan
[softly] Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
Blanket
Guys, this is my dad. Michael Ja-
Michael
Jefferson! Michael ...Jefferson, yeh. Hey, you wanna play with me?
He runs into the yard.
Michael
Come on, let's climb the tree! [turns to a tree and scales it] Come on, climb the tree, climb the tree!
Michael motions for the boys to join him. They oblige and join him up there.
Michael
Have you been up my... Wishing Tree? Tuh!
It's where I come to think and dream.
And now I'd like to show you my... Wishing Tree. 
Jam on!
Where we can laugh and giggle and scream. 
Hee hee!
Imagination is the key.

Kyle
Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.
Michael
Won't you imagine along with me?
Kyle
Mr. Jefferson?
On the ground, Blanket can't even reach the bottom rung of the ladder.
Michael
We can be spacemen, 
or pirates on the sea
Chuckajamonah!
Yes we can do everything,
and I mean, everything!
Chuckajamonah!
Up in my Wishing Tree!
Hee hee! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!

Stark's Pond, day. A group of kids skate around lazily on its frozen surface. Stan and friends race over a rise towards the lake.
Stan
Hey, you guys! You guys! [the kids gather around] You gotta come with us over to the Jeffersons!
Red
The Jeffersons?
Cartman
[breathless] They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! [his chest heaves noticeably]
Kyle
Mr. Jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house.
Cartman
They have like, video games and rides and a cotton-candy machine, oh, and, and in their back yard, guess what they have in their back yard?! Guess. A train.
Craig
[in a monotone voice] No way.
Cartman
Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
Craig
[not wanting to be left out] I believe in Mr. Jefferson!
The Jefferson house, arcade room. As the kids enjoy the toys and games found there, Jefferson swings above them on a spacious swing with Bebe on his lap.
Michael
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee, look at us on the swing! We're swinging!
Blanket
Who wants the first cotton candy?
The kids around him begin to clamor for it.
Kids
Memememememememememe
Blanket hands the first cotton-candy to Kyle.
Michael
Mememe! I'm first! I'm first!
Blanket steps away a bit astonished, but soon all the kids have cotton candy.
Michael
Oooo, let's go ride the choo-choo train!
Cartman
Choo-choo train! Yay!
The kids begin to move towards the back yard. Blanket is left on the floor trying to stand and catch up to them.
The Jefferson back yard. The kids follow Jefferson to the train.
Michael
Let's ride the train! The train!
The kids climb on and the train begins to roll.
Michael
Would you like to ride the train with me,
and start a magical journey?

Cartman
Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
Michael
Cartman, you have a beautiful voice.
Cartman
Thank you Mr. Jefferson. So do you.
Michael
Let's ride and ride on the train together
Cartman
...Train together
Michael
On a journey through both of our minds.
Cartman
I've got time. Do youuu??
Back near the sliding door, Stan, Kyle and Kenny look on. Blanket stands next to them and Kyle notices Blanket's left leg.
Kyle
Dude, what happened to your knee?
Blanket
[his skinned knee is shown] I fell down.
Kyle
[calls out] Mr. Jefferson!
Michael
[back on the train] Choo-choo train, it's all fun and games.
Cartman
Choo-choo train.
Kyle
Mr- ! Goddammit. Here, come on. We need to clean that up. [takes Blanket inside]
The bathroom. Kyle sits Blanket on the toilet and dresses the wound.
Kyle
Alright, this is gonna sting for a second.
Kyle dabs some alcohol onto a towel and presses the towel onto Blanket's knee, wiping off some dirt, then dabs some more alcohol onto the towel.
Blanket
Ow!
Kyle
I know, I know. Be cool.
Blanket
Thank you. That already feels better.
Kyle wipes Blanket's knee some more, then dabs some more alcohol onto the towel.
Kyle
So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Blanket
I have a half-brother and a half-sister. But they live with their mom now.
Kyle wipes Blanket's knee some more, then dabs some more alcohol onto the towel.
Kyle
And where is your mom?
Blanket
I don't have a mom.
Kyle
You must have a mom.
Kyle wipes Blanket's knee some more, then dabs some more alcohol onto the towel.
Kyle
You mean she doesn't live here, or she's dead, or what?
Blanket
No. I was made in a laboratory.
Kyle
What?
Blanket
My daddy wanted to have a baby, so he put me in a test tube. Then, they put me in a woman's tummy, and, when I was born, Daddy took me home.
Kyle
So you never met your mom?
Blanket
No... But I used to have a lot of bodyguards and nannies, if that counts.
Kyle
Yeah. Yeah, that counts.
The neighborhood, some time later. The boys are walking home. Kyle seems concerned.
Cartman
Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
Kyle
You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Cartman
You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
Kyle
Mr. Jefferson just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.
Cartman
Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it! [faces Kyle down] Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! [turns and walks away angrily]
Stan's house, afternoon. Stan enters the kitchen through the back door. Randy is at the breakfast nook reading a paper, Sharon puts a coffee pot onto the counter.
Randy
Well, there he is. Where have you been all afternoon.
Stan
I was over at the new neighbors, the Jeffersons.
Sharon
Oh, are they nice people?
Stan
Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
Sharon
Well, we're supposed to have the Broflovskis and the Stotches over for dinner tonight. Maybe I'll invite Mr. Jefferson too.
Stan's house, evening. The Marshes and their guests are seated at table for dinner. On the left are seated Sheila, Stephen, and Linda. On the right are seated Gerald, Mr. Jefferson, Sharon, and Randy is at the head of the table.
Gerald
So, Mr. Jefferson, did I hear you say you moved here from Kentucky?
Michael
Kentucky, yeah.
Randy
I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
Michael
No, the- they're ignorant. That's ignorant.
Stephen
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Jefferson?
Michael
Oh I'm retired now, but, I was in... pharmaceuticals
Sheila
Well our boys have really taken a liking to you. You seem to really have a way with them.
Michael
I just id- identify so much with children. Their innocence, their beauty. I think that God is in the face of every child.
Randy
....Yeeeah.
Sharon
...They are fun. [glances back, away from the table] Boys, you okay out there?
The living room. Stan, Kyle, and Blanket are seated on the sofa, eating.
Stan
Fine, Mom.
Blanket
Wow, these are great. What are they called again?
Kyle
They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
Blanket
Nah, I'm not supposed to. Dad says I have to keep my face hidden.
The doorbell rings. Stan goes to answer the front door and sees Cartman.
Cartman
What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
Stan
No, my parents are.
Cartman
You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
Stan
What?
Cartman
He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were, [Stan steps back...] and I-
He closes the door. Stan walks away and Cartman looks through a window.
Cartman
Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
The dining table.
Gerald
Hey, you know Kobe Bryant was up in Eagle today.
Randy
Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
Michael
[taken aback] D'huh?
Stephen
I think he's definitely going to jail. I just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance.
Michael
I think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men.
Gerald
Oh come on, Mr. Jefferson, you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous?
Michael
Yeah! Because their hearts are full of greed and they have... doo-doo in their souls.
Park County Police Station. Inside Harris waits for a fax to finish printing. As another officer walks by with a cup of coffee, he takes a sheet from the machine.
Harris
Hey Sergeant, take a look at this.
Yates
[disregards the sheet] Whatcha got?
Harris
Looks like a new family has just moved into South Park. One Mr. Jefferson, age 50, bought a house there and paid cash. He seems to have a lot of money.
Yates
So, what's the problem?
Harris
Take a look. Says here... [the sergeant takes the sheet and reviews it] He's black.
Yates
By God, so he is. Black and rich. Time to take this Mr. Jefferson down, just like we did Kobe.
He hands the sheet and the cup of coffee to the officer and address the department.
Yates
Let's go people!
Yates turns, takes his coat from the coat rack and puts it on
Yates
We've got another rich black guy. I want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt, and I want it done by the books!
Stan's house, night. Stan is asleep in his room when someone pounds at his window. Stan wakes up, then goes to the window.
Stan
[looks out] Kyle?
Stan opens the window. Michael, dressed as Peter Pan, crawls up and in.
Michael
Hey, Stan, whatcha doin'? [dances a little]
Stan
Mr. Jefferson Awww! [hops off the bed] It's 1:30 in the morning!
Michael
Look at me, I'm Peter Pan.
Michael draws his small sword and swings it. His mustache falls off.
Michael
T-shamon!
I'm a little boy forever.

Michale raises himself up on his tippy-toes.
Michael
Hey!
Stan
Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
Cartman
Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
Stan
He just showed up here.
Cartman
Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. [a knock is heard at Stan's door]
Stan
Jesus Christ!
Stan goes to the door and finds Kyle and Blanket in the hallway.
Kyle
Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
Blanket
[wearing his veil] Hi, Stan.
Kyle
He was out all alone in the middle of the night. Mr. Jefferson isn't even home.
Stan
I know. He's here.
Kyle
What?!
Michael
Oh Kyle, Blanket, yay, it's a slumber party!
Stan
No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
Michael
We can't go home. There's a ghost in our house. Me and Blanket are scared.
Blanket
Dad says it wants to eat us.
Michael
Please don't make us go back home. Please! We're scared, we're scared!
Blanket
We're scared!
Mr. Jefferson
Hee hee!
Stan
Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
Kyle
Come on, Blanket.
Kyle takes Blanket to bed. Stan follows them and all three slide into place.
Michael
Now let's all sleep and dream
Heehee!
of fun and adventurous things
shamonah!
It's time for us all to say goodnight

Cartman
Deeper.
Cartman turns to Mr. Jefferson and hugs him. Stan rolls his eyes and looks at Cartman again, then closes his eyes and begins to dream...
Cartman
Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
Michael
I think you're awesome too, Cartman.
They get closer and closer to each other.
Cartman
Yeah?
Michael
Yeah.
Cartman
Yeah?
Michael
Yeah.
Cartman
Yeah?
They're about to kiss, and Stan wakes up startled.
Stan
Ahaa!
Stan looks over to his right and sees them both asleep.
Michael
[wakes up] What's the matter, Stan? Did you have a bad dream?
Stan
Yeah. A really bad dream.
Stan shuts his eyes and sinks down into his bed.
Stan
Oh Jesus!
The Jefferson house. An unmarked police car, blue in color, waits across the street. Harris sips on a soda.
Yates
[using his walkie-talkie] Murphy, you inside?
Murphy
[walking through the arcade room] We're inside, sir. Harris was right. This guy looks like he has more money than all of us put together. Black sonofabitch!
He whips out a package of something white.
Murphy
I'm planting the cocaine now.
He sets it under the toy machine Cartman was using earlier.
Yates
Johnson, what about you?
Johnson
[in a closet] Placing the blood spatter now, sir. [right on a pair of Jefferson's shoes]
Yates
Frakes?
Frakes
Placing pubic hair from the raped girl now, sir.
Yates
All right, when this Jefferson guy shows up, arrest him fast and try not to beat him. There could be neighbors with video cameras. [sighs] Why do we do it, Harris?
Harris
Sir?
Yates
Why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy African-Americans with crimes they didn't commit?
Harris
Oh, why? I guess I never thought about why, sir. We just do it.
Yates
Twenty-five years I've been on the force. I've seen every kind of sick, depraved act known to humanity and still, when I see a black man walk by who has more money than me, I... want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter. But why? Maybe there is no reason. Maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride.
Stan's house, morning. Someone knocks on Stan's door.
Randy
Stan, time to get up for school. [opens the door and looks in] Stan? What the-? [sees the five people in bed] Mr. Jefferson?!
Michael
[sits up quickly] Oh oh, we were just having a slumber party.
The boys sit up and look at Randy.
Randy
Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!
Michael
Inappropriate? No, you're being ignorant. They're my friends. You see, I- I didn't have a childhood, so I'm really just a child myself.
He takes out some bills from a back pocket and approaches Randy and Sharon
Michael
Here, everything's okay. I want you each to have a hundred dollars. [gives each of them 100 dollar bills]
Randy
Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. [leaves, and Sharon watches him go]
Michael
Come on, Blanket. We have to go home and feed the animals. Bye, friends. [quickly leaves with Blanket in tow]
Sharon
Boys, I do not want you going over to Mr. Jefferson's anymore. Do you understand?
Stan
You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
Cartman
Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! [Stan, Kyle, and Sharon are shocked]
The stakeout at Jefferson house, day. The two officers are snoring, but Yates is roused by the sound of a voice.
Michael
Come on, Blanket!
Yates
Hey Har- Har- Harris! Harris!
Harris
[walks] Wha- wha- what?
Yates
It's Jefferson! He's back! [gets on his communicator] All right, people. Let's give Blacky a nice welcome home.
He and Harris whip out firearms and aim. Mr. Jefferson opens the front door and goes back to the front lawn to retrieve his wooden sword.
Yates
Whoa, wait a minute! [withdraws his gun] That guy isn't black!
Blanket heads down the steps, and Mr. Jefferson takes him inside.
Yates
Holy God, his son isn't black either! Oh Jesus! [gets on his communicator] This is Yates! Stand down! I repeat, stand down! Suspect is not black!
Yates scolds Harris.
Yates
You son of a bitch, you told my this guy was African-American!
Harris
It says right here on the final sheet he is!
Yates
[shoves Harris's face against the windshield] Does that look like a black guy to you?!
Harris
It said on the final sheet!
Yates
[throws a fit] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! We could have made an innocent man go to jail who wasn't black! Oh!
He grabs his own neck, then quickly opens his door and vomits onto the street.
Yates
Wuuugh! Wuugh! Ohaugh. Ugh.
Yates wipes his lips clean with the back of his hand and now looks exhausted.
Yates
Jesus, Harris. What are we becoming? We're supposed to... protect the people. Where have we lost our way?
Harris
Sir, it's possible that he is black, even though he doesn't look it.
Yates
[whips around and says menacingly] To hell with you! I'm never gonna frame an innocent man again! Unless I know he's black for sure!
Inside the house, Mr. Jefferson closes all the windows and curtains.
Michael
All the adults are trying to get us. Get up to your room, Blanket, and put your mask on! We can't go outside anymore!
Moments later, Blanket is in his room looking outside. Across the street, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk by. Kyle looks up and notices Blanket looking bored..
Kyle
[stops] That poor kid.
Stan
Dude, come on. We're not supposed to go over there.
Kyle crosses the street anyway and Kenny shrugs. Stan and Kenny follow/
Blanket
[opens his windows as they approach] Hi guys!
Kyle
Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
Blanket
Really? You mean it?
Michael
[interrupts, clapping] Oh yay, my friends are here! Come inside and play, guys!
Stan
Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
Michael
Chop wood? No, that's ignorant. That's poopie work. Blanket and me wanna play!
Stan
Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
Michael
Blanket likes to play, don't you Blanket? [picks him up and moves him around through the open window] Wee, look! He can fly!
Kyle
[the boys fear for Blanket's life] Jesus Christ, dude!
Blanket
Aaaaaah! [Mr. Jefferson dangles him around by his left foot]
Stan
Stop, you fucking lunatic! [Mr. Jefferson's moustache falls off and down to the ground, he pulls Blanket back inside and closes the window]
Kyle
Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
Blanket's room. He's crying on a giant plush teddy bear. Mr. Jefferson tries to soothe him.
Michael
No, Blanket, shhhh. Stop crying. It's okay, Blanket. Here, look.
Michael spins around and does a pelvic thrust.
Michael
Jeekabee durtah! [a kick and outstretched arm] Ow!
Blanket returns to crying into his teddy bear, Mr. Jefferson goes to soothe him again.
Michael
There, Blanket, shhhh. [tries to distract Blanket] Hey, hey look, hey look.
Michael touches Blanket's nose and has his thumb pop out between index and middle finger.
Michael
I got your nose. [does it again.] Look! Lookit, I got your nose. I got your nose, Blanket. See?
Does it again, and Blanket is quiet. He then smiles and grabs at his father's nose, giggling... and finds it in his hand.
Blanket
Aaaaaaaah! [throws it away and runs out of his bedroom]
Michael
No, Blanket, stop!
picks up his nose, puts it back in place, and pursues Blanket.
Michael
It's ignorant. You're being ignorant!
Yates' house, later. He enters. A woman appears moments later.
Maggie
Harrison, why haven't you called? You know how I worry.
Yates
I'm givin' up, Maggie. I'm quitting the force.
Yatesremoves his jacket, and places it on a coat rack, then walks to a desk.
Maggie
Quitting the force? You?
Yates
None of it makes sense anymore. [sits down and unloads his frustrations] I don't even know if what we're doing is right. The last thirteen hours we've been working on a case, trying to get a real scumbag off the streets. And when he walked up to the door, I could have sworn he was white. Maybe I can't tell the difference anymore. Maybe it doesn't matter. Because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy, he's back out on the streets in no time. It's just like OJ. Do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him? The tireless hours they put in?! And then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the N word out loud too many times. I guess I'm just tired. I'm just damn tired.
Maggie
[approaches and consoles him] Not another word of that kind of talk, Harrison Yates. [he looks up at her] Believe me I would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home. But I know you. Framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood. Wiping that rich, smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours. You're a good cop, Harrison Yates. You don't have to question that. Because I'm here to tell you. [she caresses him, he kisses her hand]
Yates
And you're a good wife, Maggie. You know me better than I know myself. [abruptly rises and goes to the coat rack]
Maggie
Where're you goin'?
Yates
Think I've got a little more work to do. [puts on his coat and heads outside]
The Jefferson house, night. Cartman walks up to the door and knocks.
Cartman
Mr. Jefferson? It's your best friend in the whole wide world, Eric Cartman. Mr. Jefferson? I came to sleep over tonight, remember?
Mr. Jefferson room. He's on the phone with someone.
Michael
No, Dr. Nelson, I'm telling you, you have to fly out here right now! My nose came off again!
Michael tosses his nose away, puts more lipstick on his lips.
Michael
I know you live in California; I'll pay for your plane ticket!
Michael pulls at his hair, and some of it comes off.
Michael
But I'm falling apart! I need some more of that cream and the injections! I have to look young again!
Michael picks up a stylus and pokes his lips, which pop and let fly some collagen. The skin on his lower jaw drops down and reveals some teeth.
Michael
Oh, I'm melting!
The Jefferson house, outside. A ladder is propped up against the side of the house. Kyle, Stan, and another boy approach. The boy wears the same mask Blanket usually does.
Kyle
All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
Kenny
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Stan
You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
Kenny
Aren't I too big to be Blanket?
Kyle
[seething as he climbs the ladder] I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! [Stan and Kenny follow]
Blanket's bedroom. Blanket silently cries and the door creaks open.
Stan
Blanket, you in here?
Blanket
[excited] Hi guys!
Stan, Kyle, and Kenny spread out and hop onto Blanket's bed.
Kyle
Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? [Kenny looks around]
Blanket
You are? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Kyle whisks Blanket away, Stan motions Kenny into place.
Stan
All right dude, get in his bed.
Kenny
[gets under the covers] All right, but you guys owe me for this.
Stan
Dude, whatever. At least you finally get to do something. [hops off and leaves]
Santa Barbara Police Department, Snetzl's desk. His phone rings and he picks it up.
Snetzl
Santa Barbara Police Department, this is Snetzl.
Park County Police Department, Yates' desk.
Yates
Hello, this is Sergeant Yates over at the Park County Police Department in Colorado.
Snetzl
Yes, sergeant. What can I do for you?
Yates
Well, we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town, and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area. One Martin Jefferson?
Snetzl
Hm. No, we never had a any rich African-Americans named Jefferson here. If we had, we would have framed him ourselves.
Yates
Well, he doesn't really look that black.
Snetzl
Yeah, I don't, uh... Hold on a second. There was one we framed a couple of times, but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial.
Yates
You say he disappeared? What did you frame him for?
Snetzl
We, uhhh, found some kids that had stayed over at his place, and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges.
Yates
Molestation, nice.
Snetzl
Yeah, it was a lot of work. Took years, but we were finally able to arrest him. Then we planted some evidence, took embarrassing photos of his penis, and threw him in a dirty prison cell with feces on the walls. You should have seen him squirm!
Yates
That's damn fine police work, sergeant. Damn fine.
Snetzl
Heh, yeah, but the point is this guy didn't really look black either. We had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a DNA sample to be sure.
Yates
[rises from his chair. Other officers draw near] Jesus Christ Monkeyballs! It must be the same guy!
The Jefferson house. Cartman knocks on the front door again.
Cartman
Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
The bathroom. Stan, Kyle, and Blanket prepare a carry-on bag.
Kyle
Come on, Blanket! We gotta go before your dad sees us.
They turn towards the window next to the tub and head to it. Michael appears behind them.
Michael
What are you doing with my Blanket?
The boys freeze. Kyle turns around and sees a disjointed, disheveled Jefferson in a Thriller outfit. The camera does a vertigo effect. Michael walks up to the boys.
Michael
Come on, Blanket, play with me. Jeechabee durtah! Hee! [an outstretched arm]
Stan, Kyle, Blanket
Haaaaa!
Stan
Go, go, ruuun! [the boys run out of the bathroom]
Mr. Jefferson
[whispers as he walks] Sutah!
The Hallway. The boys run towards the stairs.
Stan, Kyle, Blanket
Haaaaa!
Michael
[rounds a corner onto the hallway] Wuchatennah! Jamonah! Heehee!
Stan
[The boys enter Blanket's room] Oh Jesus!
Kenny
What the hell is going on, you guys?
Michael
[enters and heads for Blanket's bed] My Blanket! Let's play, Blanket! [pulls Kenny out of the bed]
Kenny
Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!
Michael
[tossing Kenny up into the air] Wee, he can fly! He can fly!
Kenny
Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A-
Kenny's head goes through the ceiling and blood runs down his body. It begins to drip from his feet.
Stan
Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastard!
Michael turns around and sees the boys.
Michael
Blanket? Blanket! Come play! [slowly approaches the boys]
Blanket
Nooo! [Stan turns to leave]
Kyle
[grabs Blanket's hand and leaves as well] Come on!
The Jefferson house, front lawn. Kyle opens the front door and the boys exit.
Stan
Run, Blanket, Run!
Blanket
[stumbles] Ah!
Michael
[exits] Dainduh! Dainduh Dainduh!
Kyle
[Kyle and Stan help Blanket up] Hang on, Blanket!
The three run off and a floodlight turns on, blinding Michael.
Mr. Jefferson
[shielding his eyes] Dugh! Heehee! Ja-!
Yates
[through his bullhorn] Freeze, Jefferson! The gig is up! You are wanted for child mo-les-tation!
Cartman
[hops to Mr. Jefferson's defense, standing in front of him] No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson! [a crowd, including the boys' parents, gathers] All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
Michael
It's ignorant.
His lower jaw literally drops to the ground. He bends down, picks it up, and pops it back in place.
Cartman
Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
Kyle
[returns with Blanket] All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!
Kyle
Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
Michael
[closeup for a few seconds] You're right. I've been so obsessed with my childhood that I've forgotten about his. I thought having lots of rides and toys was enough, but... Blanket doesn't need a playmate. He needs a father, and a normal life. Chickuckoo gainuh. [genuflects behind Blanket] Blanket, I wanna give away all my money. I- I wanna get a normal job and... take a shot at raising you in a normal setting.
Blanket removes the ornate mask, and Blanket blinks while shielding his eyes. Blanket moves over to his friends.
Blanket
Look everybody! I'm a normal little boy.
Yates
[approaches with Harris] Well, if you're gonna give away all your money, then, I guess we can drop all those charges. No point in putting another poor black man in jail.
Kyle
All right! Things just might work out!
Michael
Things can always work out, as long as we know we have the power to change.
Music begins to play as the neighbors and officers gather around him.
Michael
We all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts
And we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays
And you know it might be hard, but all you've got to do is start,
And you can change all of your evil molesting ways.
Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! OOOOH! Jejabee durtah! Hee-hee! Jamonah! butcha-tamonah! Chich-cha!

End of The Jeffersons

Goobacks
Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. There are two lanes on either side of the highway, with a grass median in between. A Snacky Cakes truck rolls by. Tumbleweeds begin to roll. A few seconds later, the highway sign begins to shake violently and then crackle with lightning. The camera pans to the right and more lightning is seen until a sphere of energy with a doorway appears. More tumbleweeds roll by.
A flash of light follows, and a humanoid steps forth from the sphere. He looks around and mumbles something. He walks towards the highway, looking around all the while. A car comes up quick on him and he freezes in the headlights for a while, then jumps out of the way as a Busy Beavers Moving Company truck barrels past him. A car comes up on him on the other side of the highway. He gets up quickly and steps out of the way. Traffic picks up and the humanoid dodges all the vehicles until a car almost runs him over. The car brakes and tips him over.
South Park, next day. The boys approach a house, which has more snow on it than usual in South Park, especially along the windows. Indeed, it looks like the town has just had a snow storm overnight. Each of the boys carries a shovel. Stan rings the bell. A woman answers.
Woman
Yes?
Cartman
[sweetly] Hello ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
Woman
Oh well, I certainly could use some little snow-shovelers, but eight thousand dollars seems a little steep. How about ten dollars?
Cartman
Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
Woman
How about fifteen dollars?
Cartman
It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work! [moments later, Stan and Kyle are clearing the driveway while Kenny clears the front lawn, moving by Cartman, who is now seated on the steps talking on a cell phone] Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool. [Kyle walks up to him and stops] No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak. [notices Kyle, then lowers the phone] What?
Kyle
You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
Cartman
Dude, I'm takin' a break.
Kyle
A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
Cartman
Kyle, how many times do we have to go through this? I'm the negotiator. I negotiate our price with the customers.
Kyle
All you ever do is talk about your balls!
Cartman
It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
Kyle
If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
Cartman
Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
Moments later the doorbell rings again. This time the camera is in the house looking at the door from an angle. The woman approaches and opens the door. The boys are shown, with Cartman keeping his now-bloody nose from oozing any more blood.
Stan
Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
Woman
Oh goodness, what happened?
Cartman
Shoveling accident.
Woman
Oooh, no, come on inside. [leads them in and stops in the middle of the living room, in front of the TV. A newscast is on] Wait right here, I'll be right back. [walks off]
Cartman
You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
Stan
Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.
News Announcer
This is breaking news. Here's Anchorman Aaron Brown. [the boys turn to watch]
Aaron Brown
[CNN anchor. An image of the humanoid is shown, with the caption "Guest from the Future" above it] Incredible, absolutely amazing news today. A man from the future has come back in time and is in a government hospital after being hit by a car.
Stan
Whoa.
Aaron Brown
Christina Naylon has more.
Christina Naylon
[soldiers patrol the area around Hangar 18] The news is incredible, Aaron. Experts and scientists have been with the man from the future for several hours now, and have been able to learn that he is from the year 3045. His condition is stable, and speculation continues as to why he has come. Has he come to deliver a cure for cancer? Or to fix something wrong with the past?
Aaron Brown
Have to interrupt you there, Christina. Apparently, Brad Morgan is inside the base with breaking news. Brad?
Brad Morgan
[inside the base. Scientists and soldiers mill around the alien's bed] Aaron, the scientists have been able to communicate further and have uncovered that the man from one thousand years in the future has come to our time... looking for work. Uh, he has said that the future is so overwhelmingly overpopulated that there are simply no jobs in his time, and so he built a time portal and has come back to 21st century America, uh, to find a job here.
Aaron Brown
Heheh, it's absolutely astounding. He came back here for work?
Brad Morgan
Huh... that's right, Aaron. Hi- his plan is to get a job here, in our time, so that he can put the money he earns into a savings account, uh, which will earn interest, and by the year 3045 be worth billions of dollars, uh which of course in the future will be worth only hundreds of dollars, but uh, enough, he says, to feed his family.
Aaron Brown
And now I understand we're going to Harrison Moore, uh, for an explanation on how the time portal works. Harrison?
Harrison Moore
[at the time portal. News vans, reporters and scientists, one in a space suit, gather around and marvel at the portal] Aaron, I'm standing at the time border which scientists say follow Terminator rules. That is, it's one way only and you can't go back. This is in contrast, say, to Back To The Future rules, where back and forth is possible, and of course, Timerider rules, which are just plain silly. Anyway, it appears that the man from the future is here to stay.
Later, Stan returns home. He enters with his shovel.
Stan
Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
Randy
We know, Stanley. We've been watching.
Aaron Brown
If you're just joining us, a man from over two thousand years into the future has come through a one-way time portal looking for work. Uh, the President is expected to give an announcement at any time.
Harrison Moore
Breaking news here at the time portal, Aaron. It appears that another person from the future has just arrived! [the camera pans right to show a HazMat team checking the person for radiation] It looks as if the job at Wendy's did work for the original immigrant; this second arrivee claims that man's family is now much better off, and wishes the same for his family.
Stan's house, night. Sharon puts Stan to bed and tucks him in.
Sharon
There you go. All set, sweetie?
Stan
Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
Sharon
I'm sure a lot of people do, hon. It's pretty exciting, isn't it? Now, you just get some sleep. [turns off Stan's lamp] You've had a busy day. [walks off. At the door she turns and looks at him] Goodnight, sweetie.
Stan
Night, Mom. [after she leaves, he puts his arms up and behind his head and smiles] Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. The highway sign begins to shake violently and then crackle with lightning. The camera pans to the right and more lightning is seen until it reaches the portal. A flash of light follows, and an humanoid steps forth from the sphere. Another flash brings forth another humanoid. Another flash brings forth a third humanoid. Another flash brings forth his wife, another flash brings forth their daughter, and another flash brings forth their son. Another flash brings forth another humanoid. They head for the highway, which is busy now. They all make their way across, avoiding being struck as they cross the lanes.
South Park, day. The boys once again make their rounds as shovelers and stop at a house. Stan rings the doorbell, the door opens, and a different woman greets them.
Mrs. Landis
Yes?
Stan
Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
Mrs. Landis
Ooh, oh dear, I'm sorry boys, but I've already hired someone else to do it.
Cartman
What?! Who?!
Mrs. Landis
One of those immigrants from the future. He said he would do it for twenty-five cents.
Kyle
Twenty-five cents? Well that's not even worth it.
Stan
All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. [the boys turn to go back to the sidewalk...]
Kyle
Dude. [the camera pulls back to show these immigrants shoveling snow off sidewalks and driveways up and down the street]
Stan
Son of a bitch!
CNN News Brief. An image of a family from the future is shown, with the caption above reading "Time Immigrants".
Aaron Brown
Still more immigrants from the future arrived at the time border today, some even bringing their entire families. the purplish goo that they have on their bodies when they arrive is an ectoplasmic side effect of the time-travel process. This is all giving scientists a great opportunity to learn even more about American life in the future. Chris Holt joins us now. Chris?
Chris Holt
[seated to Brown's left] Yes, there are incredible things we're learning about Americans in the future, Aaron. I- it appears that in the future, Americans have evolved into a hairless uniform mix of all races. They are all one color, which is a yellowy light-brownish whitish color. Uh, it seems race is no longer an issue in the future, because all ethnicities have mixed into one. Perhaps most interesting is how this has affected their language. The people in the future speak a complete mix of English, Chinese, Turkish and, indeed, all world languages, which sounds something like this: [makes three guttural sounds] Back to you, Aaron.
Aaron Brown
Apparently the people from the future are having a pretty easy time finding work. Since they offer to work for such low wages, they're being hired all over America.
A meeting has assembled somewhere. Two flags hang from the back of the meeting room, one of them American, the other of Colorado. Men from all walks of life argue amongst themselves.
Man 1
[left side, front row] This is bullcrap! I ain't standin' for this!
Darryl Weathers
[at the podium] All right, folks, my name is Darryl Weathers and I'm with the Construction Workers' Union. I work with a lot of fine men who have families to feed. Now, I don't know about you all, but we worked long and hard to get our pay up to a level where we could make a decent living. And now these people from the future are showin' up and offerin' to do the same work for next to nothin'! They took our jobs! [the audience, which is unemployed, clamors in agreement]
Man 2
[rises, wears dark blue short-sleeve shirt, black pants] We're in the moving business! Fourteen years we've been workin' our butts off! Now these future folk come in and we can't get work nowhere! They took our jobs!
Man 3
They took your jobs! [the rest of the audience clamors]
Man 4
Well what about us in the fast-food business?! The restaurants are firing us 'cause the future people work for a lot less! They took our jobs!
Other Men
[at random times] They took your jobs!
Stan
[pipes up] It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too! [silence] Oh, they took our jobs!
Other Men
[at random times] They took yer jobs!
Interstate 285 looking north, twilight fading to night. The highway sign is shown, but the camera pulls back to show a new CAUTION sign showing an entire family crossing. The signs begin to sway back and forth violently and crackle with lightning. The portal is shown, but now it expands so the people from the future swarm into the present en masse.
South Park, night. At Stan's house, Randy and Sharon are at the sofa reading. Sharon reads a book, Randy reads the paper. Stan enters from the front. Sharon spots him.
Sharon
Stanley, it's almost eight o'clock. Where have you been?
Stan
I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' to- [an immigrant descends the stairs with a basket of dirty clothes and stops to ask Sharon something using guttural sounds]
Sharon
Oh yes, the laundry machine is down in the basement and our son is home. Could you please set the table for dinner? [the immigrant makes some guttural sounds and walks away]
Stan
[leery] Who is that?
Randy
That's our new housekeeper, Mrs. Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays. [aside] And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.
Stan
Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
Sharon
What?!
Randy
Oh my God! [he and Sharon rise, Stan backs away a bit] Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!
Sharon
Who taught you to talk like that?!
Stan
Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
Randy
They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
Stan
I wanted my job!
Randy
Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!
Sharon
That's right! We're not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist.
Stan
Timecist?
Sharon
You know, a racist, but against people from the-
Stan
People from the future. Right, got it.
Randy
All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
The O'Reilly Factor.
Announcer
And now, here is Bill O'Reilly.
Bill O'Reilly
Welcome, welcome to the No-Spin Zone, all right? And what we're talkin' about today are the immigrants from the future. All right? Now, most people are more than happy to give a helping hand to these people who obviously need it. All right? But others are starting to say that the time portal should be closed off. All right? Now, I've got two guests with me tonight who have opposing views on the matter. On my right is pissed-off, white-trash, redneck conservative.
Darryl Weathers
Thanks for having me, Bill.
Bill O'Reilly
And on my left is aging, hippie, liberal douche.
Douche
Hello.
Bill O'Reilly
Now, pissed-off redneck, you say we shouldn't allow anyone else through the time portal, all right?
Darryl Weathers
You're Goddamned right! These people from the future are takin' all the work away from us decent present-day Americans! [leans in and low and almost grunts] They took our jobs!
Skynard Man
They took our jobs!
Darryl Weathers
Those jobs belong to people from the present!
Bill O'Reilly
All right. What say you, aging hippie liberal douche?
Douche
Heh, it's typical for conservatives rednecks like these to view the immigrants as the problem, heh, but really, the problem is America. It is our greedy multinational corporations that keep everyone else in poverty. Your ancestors came to America as immigrants. What right do you have to turn these people away?
Bill O'Reilly
All right, redneck, your rebuttal?
Darryl Weathers
[says nothing, then rises, leans forward and low, and almost grunts] They took our jobs!
Skynard Man
They took our jobs!
Stout Man
[really slurring] Too-kourderb!
South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings and the students are in their seats. So are a lot of new immigrant students.
Herbert Garrison
All right, children, the school board has mandated that I must now teach class in both present-day English and Futurespeak.
Kyle
What?!
Herbert Garrison
So, with that in mind, let's continue our lessons on verbs. Remember that there are transitive verbs such as [writes on the board] "The boy threw the red ball," which in Futurespeak of course, is [makes a sentence of grunts and guttural sounds] Everyone say it with me? [the kids repeat the sentence, which sounds like a series of barks, coming from them. Jimmy attempts it] Aaand there are intransitive verbs, such as [writes on the board] "The 11:15 bus from Denver arrived twelve hours late." Or in Futurespeak, "Vvut."
The Kids
"Vvut."
Kyle
Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!
Craig
Yeah!
Stan
That's right! [other students speak up]
Aging Hippie Liberal Douche
[steps in] Hey now, these immigrants have a right to retain their culture. Who are we to say our language is best? They deserve to have an education just as much as you do.
Herbert Garrison
Thank you, aging, hippie, liberal douche.
Aging Hippie Liberal Douche
You betcha. [steps out]
Timmy
Timmih.
Herbert Garrison
Okay, now let's get back to it, kids. What kind of verb is this? [writes on the board] "The sad girl puts balls in her mouth." Or, in Futurespeak of course, "Gluch gligh balls glych gligh."
Back at the meeting room, the unemployed men gather for another rally against the immigrants from the future.
Man 5
This is bullcrap!
Darryl Weathers
Listen up, everybody! We've just received a reply from our congressman. [unfurls a letter] "Dear intolerant rednecks, we sympathize with you all losing your jobs. However, we feel your solution of shooting everyone who crosses the time border is inhumane."
Chet
What? That's ridiculous!
Man 6
They can't do that!
Man 7
That was a good idea!
Darryl Weathers
So it appears the government ain't gonna help us! Which means we gotta take matters into our own hands! The only way to stop people from the future is to stop the future from happening!
Man 8
Hey, that's right! If there is no future, then there'll be no people from the future to come back and take our jobs!
Man 9
Take r jurbs
Darryl Weathers
All right! So, any ideas how we can stop the future from happening?
Chet
How about we cause more global warming, so that in the future, the polar ice caps melt, and it ushers in a new ice age?
Darryl Weathers
[pause] How the hell is global warming gonna cause an ice age?!
Chet
Well you know, the... global warming could bring on like a climate shift or somethin'?
Darryl Weathers
Chet, you are a fuckin' retard, you know that?! Even if global warming were real, which all proven scientific data shows it isn't, it would take millions of years for a climate shift to happen! You think an ice age can just happen all of a sudden-like?
Chet
Well I was just tryin' to be helpful.
Darryl Weathers
Well help yourself to a fuckin' science book, 'cause you're talkin' like a fuckin' retard! Now, come on people, we've got to think! Damnit, they took our jaorbs!
Many Men
[randomly] They took our jobs!
South Park, day. The boys walk down the commercial district noticing immigrants from time to time. Various immigrants greet them and try to sell them fruits, but the boys walk on. A hovering futuristic car comes up next to them, sets down, and bounces the front end up and down like a lowrider. The driver then activates the hydraulics and the car begins to dance. The boys just look in wonder as the car settles down and then moves off. Its exhaust hits the boys' faces and they cough. Next, the boys head for a Wendell's Burgers restaurant. They enter and head for the counter.
Kyle
Aw, dude.
The boys see that the restaurant is staffed by immigrants from the future. One of them approaches to take an order.
Cashier
Gaur da'ka?
Stan
Can you speak in present-day English please?
Cashier
Uh oh... Can I help... you?
Stan
Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
Cashier
[looks at the boys quizzically, then shows off the chicken sandwich to his left] Chicken sandwich?
Stan
[getting annoyed] No, a double cheeseburger and fries!
Cashier
[taps away at the machine's keyboard] A cheeg- fry?
Stan
What?!
Cashier
A cheeg- fry?
Cartman
We can't understand you, asshole! [the cashier's manager comes up and talks to him for a bit. The cashier points at the boys. The manager takes over and resets the order]
Manager
Can I help you?
Stan
I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!
Manager
[shows off the chicken sandwich to his left] Chicken sandwich?
Stan
No, it's not a chicken sandwich! [his parents enter the restaurant and stand in line behind him and the boys] I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
Randy
Stan Marsh!
Stan
Aw- awwww!
Back at the rally...
Darryl Weathers
Come on, people, think! How are we gonna stop these immigrants from takin' our jobs!
Man 10
Hey, I got an idea. Uh maybe we should all take off all our clothes, scramble into a big pile and start gettin' gay with each other.
Chet
Did you say "get gay"?
Darryl Weathers
Hey, yeah. Well that's not a bad idea!
Man 11
What? Gettin' gay?
Darryl Weathers
Think about it: These people are from the future, right? Well, if we can git everyone to turn queer, then there won't be no children to have no children, and the people from the future won't exist to take our jobs!
Jimbo Kern
I ain't turnin' queer.
Darryl Weathers
You have to, Jimbo, or else we won't be able to stop them! They took 'r jaobs!
Man 2
Yeah, they took our jobs!
Man 8
[slurring] Took our jobs!
Darryl Weathers
[begins to take off his clothes till he's in briefs and boots] Let's go over to that part of town that all the future people moved into and start humpin' each other until they disappear! Come on! [comes down from the podium and makes his way to the doors. His briefs fall off, and he turns around] Come on! You want your jobs back or not?! [turns around, walks out and turns right]
Welcome to Little Future. This part of South Park is congested and built upwards. Parts of it are rundown. The drivers there all drive hovercars. Some kids dance around on a stoop as adults walk by.
Darryl Weathers
[appears with the other rally participants, all of them naked] All right, you future bastards! Think you can take our jubs?! Well, we'll show you! Come'ere, Earl!. [the burly man wearing the Skynard hat steps forth and starts making out with Weathers] How do you like that, gooback?! [the immigrants just stare back puzzled. Weathers addresses the rest of his peers] Come on, you guys! [the other men just stare for a while, then begin to make out as well. The immigrants just look at them.] Everyone who believes in America, join in with us! We're gonna make these future bastards nonexistent!
South Park Center for Seismic Activity. Randy arrives for work with Stan in tow.
Stan
Aw, come on, Dad! How come I have to go to work with you?
Randy
Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth! [Randy opens the door and they both go inside. The office walls are now brown instead of gray. Randy closes the door and motions Stanley to a chair behind it] You just sit right there, Stanley, and you think about what you've done! [puts his coat on the coat rack and sits at his desk to begin his day]
Boss
You'll find all the copiers and printers in the next room over and then uh-
Randy
Hey, Mr. Nelson.
Mr. Nelson
Oh... R- Randy... Uh, I'm surprised to see you here.
Randy
Why? This is my office.
Mr. Nelson
Ooohh boy, didn't you get my phone message? Ooh, this is awkward. Well, the thing is, Randy, you've been- replaced.
Randy
What?
Mr. Nelson
Well we found an immigrant from the future who knows geology and he offered to work for next to nothing. Uh, this is Mr. Glughgogawk.
Mr. Glughgogawk
Gheglo.
Randy
You can't be serious.
Mr. Nelson
I'm... sorry, Randy. It's just, with all the budget cuts and all, we'll give you some time to clean out your desk. Follow me, Mr. Glughgogawk. I'll show you to the copy room. [walks away with the immigrant. Randy is left alone to contemplate his next move]
Randy
Oh my God. They took my jarb!!
Stan:
They took yer jarb!!
CNN Breaking News.
Announcer
This is CNN.
Aaron Brown
Breaking news at the time border. We go now live to Harrison Moore.
Harrison Moore
Aaron, I'm standing at the time border where some kind of mass protest has broken out. [more immigrants enter through the portal] Hundreds of men who have lost their jobs to time immigrants are here having sex with one another. [a shot of all the men in a big pile, in all sorts of positions, as news crews film them] These men have apparently sucked and screwed their way across the state and are now here at the time border trying to get national attention. These unemployed men have been having sex for several days. Joining me is their spokesperson, Randy Marsh. [Randy steps into view, patting his moustache down] Mr. Marsh, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
Randy
We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands. [another camera view shows Stan next to his father. Stan tries to block out this interview with eyes shut tight and his fingers on his nose] We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!
Darryl Weathers
Yeah America! [A close-up of the mass of men fornicating with each other]
Man 8
Take our jobs!
Harrison Moore
Do you really think you can get enough people to turn gay to destroy the future of humanity?
Randy
All we can do is try, Harrison.
Aging Hippie Liberal Douche
[walks into the picture] Trying to stop immigration is intolerant and ignorant. Those immigrants have a right to pursue happiness.
Harrison Moore
[lowers the mic to Stan] Young man, what do you think about all this?
Stan
I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us. [loosens up and opens his eyes] They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. [the mound of men stops copulating]
Man 9
[at the top of the mound] Huh?
Stan
I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
Man 11
[inside the mound] Hey. He's right. If we build for a better future, the immigrants will stay there.
Man 12
Yeah. We've got to start working towards a brighter tomorrow.
Randy
Well what are we waiting for?
Montage of green living. First scene is a group of men planting trees. Next scene is a group of people at a recycling center watching Mr. Garrison toss in his bag of spent aluminum cans. Mr. Slave then tosses in his load.
Next scene has the boys, Randy, and Weathers bringing food to African tribesmen. Next scene has the boys helping Randy and Weathers paint a wooden fence white. Next scene is a newly-minted wind farm in South Park made by the townspeople.
Stan and Shelly look at each other, smiling. Next scene has Weathers plugging his electric car into an outlet next to the garage door as others watch. Next scene has Stan bringing a gift to the towm bum. A bunch of adults follow him proudly. Next scene has some of the kids and many of the adults swaying gently to some music.
Singer
We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future begins with you and me.
We can start to make a difference if we want it for our children
Recycle that can and plant that tree, 'cause the future begins with you and me.

Cartman
Look, it's working! [one by one, the immigrants vanish from view]
Singer
The future begins with you and me.
Darryl Weathers
The immigrants are fadin' away!
Stan
We're doing it!
Next scene shows the townsfolk cleaning up a meadow. Next scene has the Marshes watching Weathers and an assistant install solar panels on the Marshes' roof. Last scene has the townsfolk tilling ground at a farm.
Singer
We've got to work for a better future, we've got to join hands for tomorrow.
Take the first step and you will see the future-

Stan
Dude, wait, wait, ho- hold on. Wait a second. [drops his shovel] This is gay.
Kyle
[drops his shovel] This is really gay.
Cartman
Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
Stan
Okay, sorry, my bad, everyone back in the pile. [everyone races back to the pile. The men take off their clothes]
Darryl Weathers
Back in the pile everyone!
Randy
We're going back to the pile.
Man 13
Jump in!
Man 14
Come on, everybody!
Man 15
Never mind, we're going back to the pile!
Man 16
Took yer jurb!
End of Goobacks

Douche and Turd
South Park Elementary, the school gym. Six cheerleaders, all fourth-graders, lead a Pep Rally '04.
Cheerleaders
We are South Park, Green and White. Let's go, Cows! Fight, fight, fight! Nobody can beat a Cow! Let's gooo, South Park![in the audience, Cartman yawns.]

Red
Hey, South Park! Do you have school spirit?
Students
[all grades] Moooooooo!
Bebe
I think us Cows have the best school spirit. Huh, Mandy?
Mandy
[new fourth grader, with braces that makes her speak with a lisp] Yeah, and South Park is really gonna stick it to Littleton next week!
Bebe
Let's bring out our mascot and get this pep rally going! [an adult in a cow suit comes out, waves to the kids, then begins to dance.]
Butters
It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
Cartman
Butters, shut the hell up! [As Mooey dances, PETA bursts in through the double doors and rushes towards the cheerleaders. They apprehend Mooey and begin beating him up, then pulling his head off]
Blonde PETA Woman
[through her megaphone] We are People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals! We protest your insensitive use of cows as your school mascot!
Herbert Garrison
Oh, Jesus, not PETA again.
Dreadlocked PETA Man
[approaches Bebe] Cows are maimed and slaughtered and used as a commodity! [throws a bucket of real blood on Bebe. Other PETA members go after the rest of the cheerleaders]
Blonde PETA Woman
[showing old slaughterhouse scenes on how to prepare beef] This is the fate of the cow! This is your insensitivity!
Students
Ewww! [a kindergartner begins to cry]
Gas Mask PETA Member
The cow is a slave! The cow is a commodity! To be thrown away by a society gone wrong!
Herbert Garrison
All right, children, I have just been informed that since our school has been attacked by eco-terrorists for the 47th time, we are going to change our school mascot.
Class
Awwwwwwww!
Stan
But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
Herbert Garrison
That's right, Stanley, the eco-terrorists win. [approaches the students with a stack of papers and begins distributing it] Now, I have here a mascot selection sheet. Every student is supposed to check the box next to the mascot they like the most. And the most popular selection will be the school's new mascot.
Clyde
But we like being the Cows! [a bucket of real blood is doused on him and the rest of the class gasps.]
Dreadlocked PETA man
You're responsible for the enslavement and genocide of millions!
Herbert Garrison
[taking action] Ge-get outta here, PETA! We're changin' the mascot already!
Dreadlocked PETA man
Who'll speak for those who cannot speak for themselves?!
Herbert Garrison
[throws some papers at the PETA member] Oh, ge-get outta here! [breaks out a can of mace and sprays it on him] Ge-get out! [the man leaves] Jesus, where do they keep coming from?! [sprays some more for effect] Go on, get outta here.
Stan
This is bullcrap, dude!
Herbert Garrison
Now children, it's not that bad. There's plenty of great new mascots on the sheet to chose from. The Hurricanes, the Blizzards, the Redskins, the Indians...
Wendy
But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
Herbert Garrison
No, those are fine. PETA doesn't care about people.
The school hallway.
Cartman
Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
Kyle
Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Giant Douche."
Cartman
Ye-heah!
Kenny
(Yeah, totally awesome!)
Cartman
Yeh- no, no, wait, wait. I got a better idea you guys. What we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in "Turd Sandwich."
Kyle
Turd Sandwich isn't better than Giant Douche.
Cartman
Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
Kyle
It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in "Giant Douche!" It's way funnier!
Cartman
It is not!
Kyle
Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
Kenny
(Giant douche.)
Cartman
Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
Kyle
Stan, do you pick giant douche or turd sandwich?
Stan
Dude, I really don't care. [walks away]
Kyle
[tallies the votes. Behind him, Butters approaches his locker and prepares to open it] That's two against one, 'cause Stan doesn't care. So it's giant douche.
Cartman:
[notices, then runs to Butters and pulls him towards the other boys] ...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
Butters
Huh?
Kyle
You hate Butters.
Cartman
Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
Butters
Hahaha, a turd sandwich!
Kyle
You misled him, fatass!
Cartman
It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
Butters
[crosses his arms] Yeah! ...What's this for? [the boys approach Jimmy]
Kyle
Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
Jimmy
That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.
Kyle
A giant douche.
Jimmy
Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?
Cartman
A turd sandwich.
Jimmy
Turhr... Ohokahay. Okay, now let's wait ten seconds. [ten seconds pass] Okay now, t-tell me the first one again?
Kyle
Giant douche.
Jimmy
[snickers] And the second?
Cartman
Turd sandwich.
Jimmy
[snickers] Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds.[ten seconds pass] All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?
Kyle
A giant douche.
Jimmy
[snickers] Okay, I think, that's it. Number 2?
Cartman
Turd sandwich.
Jimmy
[snickers] Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.
Cartman
Awwwww!
Butters
Ohhh, we lost?
Kyle
All right, it's decided. Let's all write in "Giant Douche."
Cartman
Okay. You win, Kyle.
The school gym. The students once again assembles on the bleachers. Herbert Garrison stands before the big-screen TV used in the rally earlier, and the TV reads "New School Mascot '04".
Herbert Garrison
Attention students, we have tallied your mascot nomination sheets, and there will now be a school-wide vote between the top two nominations. So here is the first most-requested candidate, a giant douche. [a giant douche steps out from behind the TV and begins dancing to 2 Unlimited's "Get ready for this."]
Kyle, Kenny
Go, giant douche!
Giant Douche
Hey, South Park! Have we got school spirit?! [a smattering of applause] We've got spirit, yes we do! Giant douches, me and you! Let's gooooo, Douches! [a smaller smattering of applause]
Herbert Garrison
And now your second nominee, Turd Sandwich. [a turd sandwich steps out from behind the TV and begins dancing to Baha Men's "Who Let The Dogs Out?"]
Cartman
All right turd sandwich!
Butters
Yeah!
Kyle
Cartman? What the hell?!
Cartman
Giant Douche sucks!
Turd Sandwich
We've got spirit, yes we do! We are sandwiches filled with poo! Yeeaahhh! [a smattering of applause]
Herbert Garrison
Students can now cast their choice between the Giant Douche and the Turd Sandwich. We'll count up the votes on Tuesday.
Kyle
You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
Cartman
Game on, Jew-boy!
Butters
Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! [looks at Cartman, smiles, and looks back at Kyle]
The front doors of the school. Stan and Kenny flank the entrance and hand out buttons as the other kids come out.
Kyle
Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.
Kenny
(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)
Kyle
Giant Douche is your man!
Stan
[exiting] Kyle, aren't you taking this a little too far? I mean, do we really want a giant douche to be our school mascot?
Kyle
Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. [something like an ice cream truck is heard, and Cartman appears driving his Big Wheels bike, pulling a portable stage. Butters is dancing on the stage, dressed as a Hawaiian hula dancer. In his hands he has leis to hand out.]
Cartman
Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives. [Butters begins tossing out the leis, and kids step forth to get them. A man shows up as well, but gets nothing] Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
Kyle
There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
Stan
I'm not voting!
Kyle
What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
Stan
I just think this whole thing is stupid! [walks off angrily]
Kyle
Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
Kenny
(Yeah.)
The Marsh house, dinnertime. The family is gathered at table, with Marvin at one end, Randy at the other. Sharon comes in with plates and the main course.
Sharon
How was school today, Stanley?
Stan
It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Sharon
...What did you say?
Randy
Did you just say that... voting is ridiculous?
Stan
No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
Randy
[clenches his fists] You don't see the point! Oh, you young people just make me sick!
Sharon
Stanley, do you know how many people died so you could have the right to vote?!
Stan
Mom, I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
Randy
[jumps upright and plants his hands on the table] You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
Sharon
Well, hold on, Randy, I think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms.
Randy
You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
Sharon
It's sexist, is what it is!
Randy
You don't understand the issues, Sharon!
Sharon
Are you calling me ignorant?!
Randy
You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
Sharon
I am sick of you belittling my opinion, you son of a bitch! [picks up the casserole and chucks it at Randy, who ducks and looks back at her angrily. They both leave the table in opposite directions.]
Shelly
[leaving the table as well] I hate this family, I hate it! [Stan looks on, shocked, while Marvin continues eating unruffled. The door bell rings. Stan leaves the table and opens the front door. A black man is outside... with his posse]
Stan
Puff Daddy?
Puff Daddy
Your friend Kyle told me you don't understand the importance of voting.
Stan
I...
Puff Daddy
Apparently, you haven't heard of my "Vote or Die" campaign. [holds up a shirt with the slogan on it]
Stan
"Vote or Die"? [upset] What the hell does that even mean?!
Puff Daddy
[whips out a gun from his back pocket, cocks it, and aims it at Stan] What you think it means, bitch!
Stan
Aaaah!
Music video. Stan is running down the street. An open-roof car pops up behind him and bears down on him.
Posse
Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!.

Puff Daddy
Rock the vote or else I'm gonna stick a knife through your eye..

Posse
Democracy is founded on one simple rule!

Overhead shot of Puff Daddy, dressed in a white suit, then in a black suit.
Puff Daddy
Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you.Yeah.

At a polling station encouraging one female voter.
Puff Daddy
I like it when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
Shake them titties when you vote, bitch! (bitch!)
[seated as two women dance for him, their asses in his face]
I slam my jimmy through your mouth roof (mouth roof)
[gently spanks a woman as she goes in to vote]
Now get your big ass in the pollin' booth.
[Fish-eye overhead view of Puff Daddy. He shoves his gun into the camera]
I said vote, bitch, or I'll fucking kill you!

Stan runs until he sees a passageway between two buildings. He does in to try to escape, but Puff Daddy and his crew find him.
Posse
Vote or die, motherfucker, motherfucker, vote or die!

Puff Daddy
You can't run from a .38, go ahead and try!

Puffy is seated in an armchair wearing a wig, surrounded by women, all in front of a Vegas-style sign saying "DIDDY"
Posse
Let your opinion be heard! You gotta make a choice

Raps to a chrome reflection.
Puff Daddy
'Cause after I slit your throat you won't have a fucking voice [Stan runs again, looking behind him, but runs into a gun in his face]

Puff Daddy
Vote or die! Vote or die! [Puff Daddy's gun is joined by the guns of his posse. Stan is looking at five barrels]

Stan
...Okay. I'll vote.
Cartman and Butters begin door-to-door campaigning. Cartman knocks on a door and Clyde answers.
Clyde
What do you guys want?
Cartman
We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
Clyde
I haven't decided yet.
Cartman
Oh really? Well, that's interesting. You certainly should think about it and make the right decision. [pulls out a wrapped hard candy and shows it] Butterscotch candy?
Clyde
[reaches out and grabs it] Sure. [opens it]
Cartman
Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
Butters
A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. [Clyde bites into the candy, producing loud crunches]
Cartman
You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
Butters
Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
Cartman
So, come voting day, you'll now most likely vote for the turd sandwich, yes?
Clyde
[finishes the candy, then thinks for a few seconds] I'm still not totally sure.
Cartman
Well then, perhaps we could interest you in [pulls out another wrapped candy] another butterscotch candy? [Clyde takes the candy and consumes that one as well]
South Park Elementary, now a polling station. A "Vote for School Mascot!" hangs on the back wall and over the hallway. A reluctant Stan takes a ballot, and Kyle smiles, thinking he has Stan on his side.
Kyle
You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
Stan
I guess... [P Diddy and his posse look on from one end of the polling station, with P cocking his gun]
Kyle
Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
Stan
Okay. [finishes up and seals his ballot, then walks away]
Kyle
Woah... wait, what are you doing?
Stan
I'm voting.
Kyle
No, no, you... you wrote down Turd Sandwich.
Stan
Yeah, I know.
Kyle
...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
Stan
[annoyed] I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
Kyle
Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
Stan
Wait a minute, you didn't want me to vote, you wanted me to vote for your guy!
Kyle
Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?! [calls out to] Puffy!
Cartman
[interrupts] Hey, fuck off, Kyle. [aside, about Puffy and his crew] Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
Stan
Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
The Principal's Office, later.
Principal Victoria
We've simply had it with your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Voting just doesn't appear to be important to him.
Randy
Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!
Stan
The whole thing is a joke!
Sharon
You see? He's out of control. It's nearly torn our whole family apart.
Principal Victoria
Well, my hands are tied. We can no longer have Stan's behavior jeopardizing the other children. He must be removed.
Randy
Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!
Principal Victoria
No, I'm afraid it's worse than that. By county law I'm bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible.
Randy
Expulsion?!
Principal Victoria
No. Banishment.
Stan
B-bani-banishment?
Principal Victoria
You can appeal to the city council, but I don't think it'll do any good. Your son must leave South Park, never to return.
Sharon
[goes over to Randy and cries into his chest] Oh, Randy!
Randy
Our son, banished! Where did we go wrong?! [cries on Sharon's shoulder]
Stan
You-you're all joking, right?
A moonlit partly-cloudy night in South Park. The townsfolk are gathered at the edge of town, with Stan facing them all alone. A horse stands at the ready on one side of Main Street.
Mayor McDaniels
[steps forth and reads a proclamation] As it was in the times of our forefathers, so it is now. Stan Marsh, for not following our most sacred of rites, you are hereby banished from South Park for all eternity. Or until you decide that voting is important. Good-bye, Stan. May the gods treat you more kindly than we did. [the townsfolk step forth and begin ripping away at Stan's coat and shirt. Herbert Garrison is first: he rips off a piece of Stan's coat, spits on it, and throws it back at Stan. He leaves and Officer Barbady steps forth, repeating what Herbert Garrison did. Craig follows suit, then Kyle steps up]
Kyle
Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal? [Stan sighs, but says nothing more in response] Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
Stan
I'm not voting! [Kyle then steps forth and repeats what the others did before him]
A bodyguard
Yo, Puffy man, are we just gonna let this happen? [cocks his weapon] We've gots to kill this non-votin' fool!
Puff Daddy
No, Justacious, let him go. He won't survive a fore-night in the wilderness. [the adults tie Stan up on the horse backwards and send him off with supplies to tide him over for a while]
Randy
This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.
Stan
Dad, isn't this a little extreme?
Randy
Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is. [puts a pail over Stan's head] Goodbye, Son. [stops for a few seconds, then swats the horse to get it moving. The horse walks off slowly. Stephen Stotch steps up with a horn and blows into it. Randy and Sharon stand together, embracing shoulders] That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
A plain, night. Stan rides into the night and into the morning on the plain, then through a desert, then into a forest. A group of people appear and spot him
Bearded PETA Member
Look! What is that?
Blonde PETA Member 2
Oh, the poor thing!
Stan
Hello? [the people gather round and remove the pail]
Blonde PETA Member 2
Don't worry, we'll free you.
Bearded PETA Member
Just sit still for a moment.
Stan
Oh, thank God.
Bearded PETA Member
Get offa him, you filthy human! [they throw Stan off the horse. The pail rolls away. Stan looks back, confused, tufts of hair popping out through the holes on his torn cap. The people were apparently talking to the horse, not to him. The camera goes back to the horse, and the people are shown to be members of PETA. They're cleaning the horse up]
Blonde PETA Member 2
Poor thing needs water.
Bearded PETA Member
You're safe now.
Blonde PETA Member 2
Shame on you, making this horse your slave. [a balding man throws real blood on Stan]
Stan
Awww!
Blonde PETA Member 2
Come, you can live with us.
Bearded PETA Member
We will give you food and shelter.
Stan
What about me?
Bearded PETA Member
Open the gate! [A pair of gates open up to the PETA compound. The members lead the horse in and Stan trails along. They approach whom looks to be the leader of the compound. The compound itself has all kinds of animals - it's an animal sanctuary]
Blonde PETA Member
[presenting the horse]This poor creature is in need of food and water.
Balding Man
[strokes the horse's mane] You have a home here, friend.
Bearded PETA Member
The... kid wants to stay, too.
Stan
I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
Balding Man
I don't know if you can stay. We'll have to ask Dr. Cornwallis. Come. [they walk among the animals. Stan looks around and takes it all in.] We don't normally allow outsiders. See, here we live in harmony with animals. They're not our pets but our fellow living beings. We work with the animals and try to live as they do. [stops, lowers his pants, and shits onto the ground. Stan looks on astonishment, then walks around the pile of shit as the man pulls his pants back up and walks on.] We make friends with the animals. We coexist, and we... intermarry. [approaches a llama and puts his arm around her neck] This is my wife, Janice. [Stan looks on quizzically] The outside world looks down on a man marrying a llama, but our love knows no boundaries. [he turns to the llama, has her face him, and starts kissing her. Stan just gawks at the pair]
Stan
Wow, you guys really love animals.
Balding Man
[moves on to a man and a chicken] And why not? Mark here has been with Kelly for three years now. [moves on to another man and an ostrich] And Gary and Sally here have just managed to have a child together. [in a manger is an ostrich-baby, somewhat humanoid with an ostrich beak]
Ostrich-baby
Kill me...
Balding Man
Yes, life here is good and natural. But now that you know where our compound is, you'll either have to live with us, or be murdered. [they stop before a tent]
Stan
I'll live with you.
Balding Man
It's not up to you. You'll have to talk with Dr. Cornwallis. [Stan pauses at the tent's entrance, then enters and approaches a goat, which is munching on hay. The goat stops and looks at Stan, then resumes eating. Stan exits the tent] What did he say?
Stan
He said I can stay.
Balding Man
Excellent! Dr. Cornwallis is wise beyond his year. Here's your PETA shirt and a bumper sticker. [Stan looks at his new stuff]
SP Public Access Presents: Debate 2004.
Announcer
This is Debate 2004 with your host, Jim Lehrer.
Jim Lehrer
Welcome to the cable-access televised debate between a giant douche [screen left] and a turd sandwich [screen right] We'll start with Giant Douche. Sir, some students and parents are reluctant to have a... giant douche represent them. What do you say to those people?
Giant Douche
Jim, first of all I would like to thank you for monitoring this debate. And I would like to thank all of the students and their parents for coming.
Cartman
Aww, suck-up, suck-up! [a man behind him and to his right leans over and shushes him] What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
Giant Douche
But I would hope that those students and their parents who question my qualities would simply look at my opponent. He is a turd sandwich
Turd Sandwich
[leaning forward] You're a turd sandwich.
Giant Douche
... No, sir, if you'll pardon me, you are in fact, the turd sandwich.
Turd Sandwich
[quickly countering] You're a turd sandwich.
Giant Douche
... Sir, you are a turd sandwich.
Turd Sandwich
[quickly countering] You're a turd sandwich.
Jim Lehrer
Ahh, Turd Sandwich, I will ask you not to speak out of turn.
Turd Sandwich
I-I'm sorry, Jim.
Giant Douche
Anyway, as I was saying, ahh... wait, I-I forgot what I was saying.
Turd Sandwich
Ha. What a douche.
Jim Lehrer
All right, Turd Sandwich, this next question is for you. How should South Park Elementary enforce its laws of conduct for young athletes during sporting events.
Turd Sandwich
[long pause] ...Uh, you know, uh, my opponent wouldn't even know the answer to that question. If you ask him the same question, he would not answer it. [Giant Douche just looks at him] He would stand around and just babble on and on about nothing until he was finally saved by the buzze-. [the buzzer sounds over his last two words.]
Jim Lehrer
Your time is up, Turd.
The PETA compound, next morning. Stan scrubs away at the empty tubs and buckets of food the animals ate from the previous day. The bald man approaches.
Balding Man
Stan, I want to introduce you to my stepdaughter, Teresa. [the camera pans down to show a lamb with small horns] She seems to have taken a liking to you. [suggestively] And she's ovulating.
Stan
Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.
Balding Man
Stan, some PETA members are growing concerned that maybe you don't love animals.
Stan
I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
Balding Man
You... don't belong here, Stan. You should return home.
Stan
I can't. I was banished for not voting.
Balding Man
But, why on earth wouldn't you wanna vote?
Stan
I think voting is great. I just didn't care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
Balding Man
But Stan, don't you know? It's always between a giant douche and a turd sandwich. Nearly every election since the beginning of time has been between some douche and some turd. They're the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics.
Stan
I guess... I guess you're right. [casts his eyes down and to the left in reflection. An arm appears, with a gun at the end aimed at Stan]
Puff Daddy
Yo, what did I say was going to happen to you, bitch? [his four bodyguards aim their guns at Stan as well]
Stan
[jumps] Aaah!
Man in Shorts
[pops in] Aaaah!! He's wearing the skin of an animal! [runs off, only to return with a pail of real blood] Take that! [throws the blood at Puff Daddy, who spreads his arms out and down. The man calms down] I... hope that teaches you a lesson about wearing fur.
Puff Daddy
Itius, Rodicus! [the bodyguards fire their weapons at the PETA members]
Bodyguard
Vote or die!
Stan
[braves his way through the crossfire, but gets hit on his left shoulder] Aaaah!! [keeps moving]
PETA Man
[goes to shield a dog] Protect the animals! Protect the animals! [he's shot and falls away. The dog then urinates on the man's head]
Balding Man
[rushes up to his llama and holds her] Janice, we shall die together in each other's arms! [three shots kill him and the llama prances away. More PETA members fall.]
Ostrich-baby
Kill me! Kill meee!! [Dr. Cornwallis is out of his tent and munching on the head of a dead man]
South Park Elementary polling station. Mr. Mackey tallies up the votes.
Mr. Mackey
M'kay... that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich.
Randy
[through clenched teeth] So who won, Mr. Mackey?
Mr. Mackey
It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.
Cartman
Oh, no! Noooo!!
Kyle
Ha! You lose, fatass!
Butters
[by the doors, motions to the others to look] Uh hey, wait a minute! [the others present gather round and look out. Stan approaches the school, battered and injured, and the others stream out of the school]
Randy
Stan!
Sharon
Stan, you came back. Does that mean... you learned the importance of voting?
Stan
I learned that I'd better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because it's usually the choice I'll have.
Randy
He's going to vote!
Townsfolk
[murmuring amongst themselves] He's going to vote. He's going to vote. [they gather round and hoist Stan up, carrying him inside. Stan is lowered and he fills out the ballot. He holds his shoulder and thinks a moment while images of an eagle, the White House, and the US flag float in the background. He makes up his mind, he votes for Turd Sandwich. He considers his vote, then approaches the ballot box and drops his ballot in. Mr. Mackey, holding the box, spins around in his chair happily.]
Singer
Let's get out the vote! Let's make our voices heard!
We've been given the right to choose between a douche and a turd.
It's democracy in action! Put your freedom to the test.
A big, fat turd or a stupid douche. Which do you like best?

Mr. Mackey
[Adding Stan's vote to the tally] Stan's vote bring the total votes for Turd Sandwich to... thirty six! And Giant Douche has... one thousand, four hundred, and ten. Giant Douche still wins!
Some Townsfolk
Yeah! All right!
Other Townsfolk
Aawwww!
Stan
Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
Randy
Hey! That's not true, Stan.
Sharon
[genuflects behind Stan] You can't judge the merits of voting on whether or not your candidate won.
Randy
[genuflects behind Stan] Your vote still mattered.
Herbert Garrison
[rushing into the school] Hey everybody! [holds up a shredded PETA shirt. Everyone turns and looks] They just found all the PETA members murdered at their compound! [all gasp]
Mr. Mackey
What the? They're all dead? Well, that means...
Clyde
That we can go back to being the South Park Cows! [opens his jacket and shows off his Cows shirt]
All
Hooray! All right!
Randy
[to Stan] Now your vote didn't matter.
End of Douche and Turd

Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes
South Park, day. A lovely tree appears and the camera pans down to street level. Stan and friends are on the sidewalk across the street moving along.
Cartman
You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
Stan
...What?
Cartman
Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. [laughs heartily. The other boys stop]
Kyle
That is fucking stupid, Cartman!
Cartman
Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
Herbert Garrison
Hey everybody, it's time! [everyone stops and looks] It's time!
Townsfolk
[a small group] It's time. Oh, it's time? It's happening. It's happening now? Let's go! [they move off to their left]
Stan
It's time for what?
Herbert Garrison
Get down to Metzger's Field! It's about to happen! [everyone follows him towards the field]
Metzger's Field, later. A man is speaking to the crowd gathered there.
Manager
People of South Park I am pleased to be with you on this most historic day. A day you were certainly all remember... as the day your town... became great. The grand opening of the first South Park... Wall-Mart! [the camera zooms out to show the full scope of the store. Everyone applauds and cheers]
Randy
[hugging Sharon] Look at it, honey. It's so big.
Herbert Garrison
[hugging Mr. Slave] It's like we're a real town now. [the boys finally arrive]
Cartman
Whoa, awesome!
Kyle
Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
Man
Yeah! Now it's a Wall-Mart!
Manager
I know that with the opening of the South Park branch of Wall-Mart, you will all see your town completely change... [walks over to the entrance, which has a banner across it: "Grand Opening."] Now, shop friends. Shop! [steps aside and the doors open to a spacious store. The townsfolk rush inside]
Randy
It's beautiful!
Marvin Marsh
[greeting shoppers at the door.] Welcome to Wall-Mart. Welcome to Wall-Mart. ...Welcome to Wall-Mart.
Sheila
Sharon, isn't that your father?
Sharon
Yes. Wall-Mart is the leading employer of seniors. And they also employ the handicapped.
Jimmy
[approaching] Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today?
Sharon
Why yes, I'd love one, Jimmy. [Jimmy turns and approaches a line of carts. He tugs at the one in the front, wrestling it away from the other carts. Once it's out far enough, he jumps to the rear and pushes it out]
Chef
[awestruck] My God. Look at all these incredible bargains.
Cartman
[the boys are in the movie aisle] Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
Kyle
Why the hell would you want three copies of the same movie?
Cartman
Because one copy is nine ninety-eight! But this way you save like twenty bucks!
Kyle
You only need one copy, r-tard!
Cartman
Okay, fine, dumbass, YOU go ahead and buy one copy for nine ninety-eight!
Kyle
Okay, fine, I will! [grabs a copy] H-wait a minute! I don't even want one copy of Time Cop! [puts it back]
Cartman
Dude, you can't shop for crap. [a wide shot of the store]
Woman
[shopping with her husband] I can't believe these bargains.
Manager
[from an office window above the showroom floor] Fools. Ignorant fools.
The Marsh house, night. The living room has been redecorated with items got from Wall-Mart. The family is enjoying snacks in fancy plasticware.
Randy
Just look at the Marsh family, huh? Brand-new television, new plastic dishware and cups, and enough bulk-buy ramen to last us a thousand winters. [three huge pallets of ramen are shown]
Stan
Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
Randy
It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.
The Marsh house, later. The house is asleep; Randy is dreaming, and reacting to his dreams.
Whispers
Six ninety-nine, fifteen dollars, free for fifteen ninety-eight...
Randy
[suddenly awake] Aaaah! [looks at the window and crawls out of bed, then walks towards the window. He plants his hands on the window panes, and in the distance he sees that great shining beacon called Wall-Mart. He opens his pajama shirt and presses his body against the window. A soft sigh leaves his lungs...] Yeaaah... [Sharon wakes up]
Sharon
Randy, what are you doing?!
Randy
[wraps himself up again and goes back to bed] Anu-nothing! [puts on his slippers] I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
Sharon
It's almost midnight.
Randy
Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there. [with determination] I can have all the bargains to myself! [heads out]
Wall-Mart, midnight. Randy enters dressed in pajamas and robe, only to find more shoppers in there. Wall-Mart never closes, and it's never empty. An elderly lady greets him.
Elderly Woman
Thanks for coming to Wall-Mart. [waves] All are welcome. All are welcome! [Randy is stunned that he's not the only shopper there]
Next morning, the boys are on a sidewalk heading towards downtown.
Cartman
Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
Kyle
Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. [they pass by a man closing up his shop for the last time]
Mr. Farkle
Oh, sorry boys. I'm going out of business.
Kyle
Why, Mr. Farkle?
Mr. Farkle
I can't compete with Wall-Mart's low prices. Everyone is shopping there now, and... well, I can't make ends meet. [Cartman pulls out a violin from somewhere and begins playing it masterfully] I've got to sell the store and try to find another line of work.
Kyle
[glares at Cartman] Cartman, stop it!
Cartman
What? I just felt like playing a little violin, Kyle.
Mr. Farkle
I appreciate your business, boys, but you'll have to try somewhere else in town. [walks away sobbing]
Kyle
See?! That sucks, dude!
Cartman
What? That's called progress, Kyle.
Kyle
Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores? [Cartman whips out the violin and plays it again] And what about all the- [looks at Cartman, takes away his violin, breaks it in half using his leg, and throws the pieces to the ground]
Cartman
... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. [gives Kyle the finger, turns around, and walks away. Kyle watches him leave]
Stan
Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. [Kyle turns, and the three remaining boys walk away.]
Downtown, later. The boys arrive at Main Street and are startled.
Kyle
What the hell? [before them is a downtown that is shuttered and decayed. The asphalt is gone from the roads and eagles hover over the area. A window crashing makes them jump, and Butters appears around a corner, making weird noises.]
Stan
Butters? [more strange noises come from Butters' mouth]
Kyle
Butters? What the hell are you doing?
Butters
Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. [this is true. Butters resumes his monster act.]
Stan
Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. [the boys turn and leave.]
The Marsh house, later. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny enter to find a house stuffed with Wall-Mart items.
Stan
Dad? [looks around at all the stuff] Jesus Christ, Da-dad! Dad?!
Randy
Staaaan? [the boys hear him and rush over to the source of the noises]
Stan
Dad, oh my God!
Randy
Staan...
Stan
What? D-dad, are are you dying?
Randy
No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.
Stan
But you-your face!
Randy
Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one? [tears one off and sticks it to Stan's cheek] Here. It's a little turtle. [faints and falls over]
Wall-Mart, later. Shopping continues as usual. In his office, the Manager reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle of liquor. He takes two sips and quickly hides it when he hears a knock at his door.
Manager
Come in? [the boys and their parents, Butters' parents, Chef, Herbert Garrison and Mr. Slave all enter] Oh hello, fine shoppers.
Chef
Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall-Mart here anymore.
Randy
We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.
Manager
[begins to cackle nervously] What? What, you think I want to be here? I hate this place. But it... won't let me leave.
Kyle
But you run the Wall-Mart.
Manager
Oh, you're wrong! [rises from his chair and moves towards the group] Wall-Mart... isn't run by anybody! First it reels you in with its bargains. Next thing you know you, you're workingbe at the Wall-Mart because it has all the jobs. Then you're sitting in a little office, trapped on all sides.
Chef
They why don't you just quit?!
Manager
[whispering loudly] Not so loud! It can hear you.
Kyle
You hate Wall-Mart, too? [rumbles emanate from the walls]
Manager
Aah! [nervously] I didn't say that! I love Wall-Mart! With all its... fantastic bargains and one-stop shopping, who can't love it, right? [turns around and grabs some papers] Uh, Wa-Wall-Mart takes the hassle out of shopping and, and makes it both affordable and fun. [he writes as he talks, then shows the group what he wrote: "NOT SAFE TO TALK HERE."] Ah-and Wall-Mart really gives back to the community! Us people are certainly happy to have a store like Wall-Mart, aren't we? [writes some more and shows the group a second sheet: "MEET ME OUT BACK IN 5 MINS." He grimaces and tries to hint at them. The group leaves.]
Randy
Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.
Gerald
Yeah. That guy probably thinks he can get us to go away by being so goofy! [circles his finger round his ear to indicate insanity. Seconds later the manager screams and flies out the window, only to end up hanging himself. The group looks on as the manager's pants drop off and poo follows shortly]
Cartman
[catching up with the other boys] Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!
The Marsh house, night. The family is at table waiting for dinner. Sharon walks in with steaks.
Sharon
Here we go, everyone. I got three nice steaks from South Park Grocery. We'll have to share them.
Randy
Heh, I remember when we could afford to buy six steaks when we shopped at Wall-Mart.
Stan
Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
Randy
I know, I know! God! [pounds the table] Bleeeh! [Sharon joins them at table and the family begins eating]
Stan
Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- [knocks over his glass of milk, which spills onto Shelly]
Shelly
Oh, you stupid turd!
Randy
Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!
Sharon
We do?
Randy
Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
Stan
But Dad, we're not supposed to shop at-
Randy
STAN! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
Wall-Mart, night. The Marsh family arrives and sees what Randy saw before.
Randy
Heeeey... [The Broflovskis approach and Randy looks] Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!
Gerald
Well where else was I gonna get a napkin dispenser at nine thirty at night?
Randy
[noticing other familiar faces] Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo! [the shoppers stop and look] Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!
Herbert Garrison
Well what are you doing here, Randy?
Randy
I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
Stan
Dad!
Randy
Oh all right, maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips. And butter. [pulls out a sheet and looks at it] And some new pliers.
Gerald
Jesus! Look at us! We all don't like the Wall-Mart, but we can't stop coming here.
Jimbo
It's like some mystical evil force.
Randy
Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
Herbert Garrison
Let's burn it down!
Chef
No, no, no! Let's freeze it!
Stephen
I think it's best we try to reason with it.
Kyle
No! All we have to do is not shop at Wall-Mart anymore! If you want it to go away, all it takes is a little self-control and personal responsibility.
Outside, later. The Wall-Mart is on fire and the shoppers are watching it burn.
Randy
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. [the people begin to sway back and forth]
All
Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. Kumbaya, my Lord...
Sidewalk, next day. The boys are walking along.
Cartman
You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
Kyle
[looking at Cartman] It wasn't my idea to burn the Wall-Mart down.
Cartman
No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
Kyle
Dude, our town is going to be better without the- [sounds of construction are heard. Kyle turns to look. ] What the?
Cartman
Oh, awesome! [rushes towards Wall-Mart]
Kyle
How... How did this happen? [the other boys make their way to the store, then look around at the restored store, which is running as if nothing had happened the night before. Kyle's parents are shopping there, and they run into the boys.] Mom, Dad? Why are you shopping here?
Gerald
We can't destroy it, son. We have to learn to live with it.
Randy
Can I help you? [the boys turn around and see the man is Randy, and the jump back in fright]
Stan
Dad, what are you doing?!
Randy
You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
Stan
Dad, you're a geologist!
Randy
I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
Outside. The boys walk away from Wall-Mart and see a driver lifting I-beams into place with his crane.
Kyle
Hey! Hey! [the driver looks at them] Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
Driver
Sorry kid, we've got orders from corporate headquarters.
Kyle
But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!
Driver
You're gonna have to talk to the higher-ups.
Stan
Where are they?
Driver
Bentonville, Arkansas. That's where Wall-Mart started, that's where all the bigwigs are. [drives away]
Kyle
Looks like we're gonna have to go to Arkansas. Come on, guys. We're gonna put a stop to Wall-Mart once and for all!
Cartman
[Inside the store] Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents? [freezes in place and hears sounds] Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again? [turns a little angry] Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. [with a look of determination, he leaves the store.]
Coyote Lines, night. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are at the ticket booth.
Stan
Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.
Cartman
[rushing up to join them] Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
Kyle
No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
Cartman
Nuh-uh.
Kyle
Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, "Haha! I was working for Wall-Mart all along!" or something.
Cartman
I am not, Kyle!
Stan
Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. [he and Kenny head for the doors]
Kyle
All right, fine. Come on, fatass! [leaves to catch up with Stan.]
Cartman
[pulls out a knife from his back pocket] Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
Kyle
[rushes out to face Cartman] I heard that!
Cartman
You heard what?
Kyle
You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
Cartman
That's not what I said! [Stan comes out to see what's going on]
Stan
Dude, come on!
Kyle
He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
Stan
Dude, we have to go!
Kyle
God-damnit! [turns and heads towards Stan]
Stan
Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!
Cartman
[to himself] Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
Bentonville, Home of Wall-Mart. A bus pulls up to the store's headquarters and lets the four boys off.
Stan
Goddamn, that took a long time.
Kyle
It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
Cartman
[drawing out the syllables] I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
Corporate Headquarters, inside. A cavernous warehouse opens up before them, with busy workers, and a receptionist greets them.
Receptionist
Can I help you?
Kyle
Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
Receptionist
Who does? Nobody likes what the Wall-Mart does, but it keeps... right on doing it.
Kyle
We want to talk to who's in charge.
Receptionist
In charge? I guess that would be Harvey Brown. He's the current president of Wall-Mart. One of the original creators.
Stan
Where's he?
An ashtray. A hand rubs spent cigarette butts into it. The camera pulls out to reveal the president and the boys, and lots of empty glasses of liquor.
Harvey Brown
We... invented the Wall-Mart Super Center in 1987. The idea was simple: build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low. [defeated, buries his face in his left hand] We didn't know what we were doing. In just four years, it was out of control.
Kyle
So how do we stop it?
Harvey Brown
[raises his head] You don't stop it.
Stan
There has to be a way!
Harvey Brown
There's nothing! Don't you understand?! Nothing can stop the Wall-Mart in your town! ...Unless... of course, you can find and destroy its heart.
Kyle
The heart of Wall-Mart?
Cartman
Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
Harvey Brown
Every Wall-Mart has a heart, somewhere near the television department. Destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process!
Cartman
You speak too much, sir!
Stan
Why don't you guys just destroy the heart?
Harvey Brown
Because the Wall-Mart stops you. Many have tried, kid. Union leaders, nature activists, even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the Wall-Mart and now. They are Wall-Mart shoppers all.
Kyle
All right. C'mon you guys. We have to get back home. [they drop down and leave the room]
Harvey Brown
[shakes his head] It won't work, don't you understand?! It isn't gonna stop until there's nothing but Wall-Mart left! Jesus, what did we do?! What did we do?! [the boys are at the doors, about to leave. Mr. Brown spins around on his stool] Boys! [the boys turn and see him take a gun to his head] Tell the world... I'm sorry! [the boys are alarmed]
Stan
No, dude, don't! [Mr. Brown shoots himself through the temple and falls over on his left side, dead. Seconds later he craps through his pants, leaving a hole in them and a fallen bar stool nearby. A few moments of shock, and then Cartman cracks up]
Cartman
[pointing to Kyle] That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
A stormy night in front of Wall-Mart. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny arrive dressed in camouflage.
Kyle
All right, this is it! If Wall-Mart has a heart, we have to find it and destroy it! No matter what the Wall-Mart does to try to stop us, we have to be strong! Let's do it.
Cartman
[rushes in and blocks their path. holding a dagger] I'm afraid not, Kyle! Wall-Mart is a great store! I could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains! You see, I was working for Wall-Mart all along!
Kyle
I knew you were!
Cartman
No, you didn't.
Kyle
Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
Cartman
No, you didn't.
Kyle
Yes, I did!
Cartman
No, you didn't.
Kyle
Yes, I did!
Cartman
No, you didn't.
Kyle
Yes, I did!
Cartman
No, you didn't.
Kyle
Yes. I did! [a few more rounds of this and they stand head to head, silent]
Cartman
...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
Kyle
[interrupting] -slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I- [Cartman babbles loudly to drown him out] -and I told you that-
Cartman
[plugs his ears] I can't hear you! Lalalalalala! [once he's sure Kyle is quiet, he unplugs his ears and pulls out his dagger] I'm sorry, boys. But if you want to hurt the Wall-Mart, you'll have to go through me! [holds out the dagger, ready for battle.]
Kyle
[he and Stan walk around Cartman] We don't have time for this! Kenny, keep him away from us! [Kenny does as told]
Cartman
Very well, Kenny! Let us battle! [Kenny begins delivering blows at Cartman] Ow, Kenny. K-Kenny! Knock it off.
Stan and Kyle enter the store and walk past the greeter Marvin Marsh.
Marvin Marsh
Welcome to Wall-Mart.
Stan
Save it, Grandpa!
Kyle
We've gotta find the television department. [the lights flicker and turn off. Randy leaps into view in front of the boys, carrying an ax. Stan and Kyle scream]
Randy
Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.
Stan
Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
Randy
Shhhhh! What are you talking about?
Stan
One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
Randy
Television department... All right, come on, let's go! [they move down the aisle for some distance. Randy stops and jumps] Oh my God!
Stan
What?!
Randy
Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
Stan
Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! [the three make their way to the back, but Randy can't help but look at all the bargains]
Randy
Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! [they come across a bunch of bikes priced at $29.99. They scream and run off. The boys run down another aisle, but Randy isn't with them.]
Kyle
I think I see the television department in the back!
Stan
Is that the right way, Dad? Dad?! [looks around, then turns to his right. Kyle turns to his left. Both boys see Randy] Dad!
Randy
The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!
Stan
Come on, Dad!
Randy
I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
Stan
No, dad! We need your keys!
Randy
This bargain is too great for me! I'm gonna have to buy these! Here! Take the keys and go on! [tosses the keys to Stan, who catches them] The television department is near the back! Next to the cell phones! Go! Hurry! I'm gonna go buy these screwdrivers! [the boys leave the aisle]
Stan
[passing the candy display] There! The television department!
The television department. The wall is lined with TVs of all sizes. A hand appears and presses a button, and all the TVs turn on, showing the boys on screen. The camera pans over to the two boys, who are looking at a man dressed in white.
Wall-Mart
Hello, boys. Congratulations on getting this far. [the boys approach him]
Kyle
Who are you?
Wall-Mart
I am... Wall-Mart. [the boys look at each other]
Stan
You?
Wall-Mart
I've taken this form in order to talk to you. But I can take many forms. [dons a brimmed hat] Does this suit you better? Or perhaps you prefer this form? [takes off the hat and puts on a robe] I can take whichever form I like. [removes the robe and puts on a pirate hat and black patch over his left eye.]
Stan
We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
Kyle
Where's the heart?
Wall-Mart
To find the heart of Wall-Mart, one must first ask oneself, "Who is it that asked the question?" [the boys look at each other again]
Stan
Me. I'm asking the question.
Wall-Mart
Ah, yes, but who are you?
Stan
Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?
Wall-Mart
Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!
Kyle
The question is, "Where is the heart?"
Wall-Mart
Very well. You want to see the heart of Wall-Mart? It lies beyond that plasma-screen television. [the boys look to their right and walk over. The open a small door marked "EMPLOYEES ONLY" and they open it. A rectangular mirror is behind it.]
Stan
It's a mirror.
Wall-Mart
Yes, don't you see? That is the heart of Wall-Mart. You, the consumer. I take may forms: Wall-Mart, K-Mart, Target. But I am one single entity: Desire!
Stan
Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. [the boys turn and face the mirror again, and Kyle takes a black mallet to it. It shatters.]
Wall-Mart
Gaaah! No! No, what have you done?! [the building begins to rumble] Now you shall see my true form! [Removes his mustache and begins to march around with vigor and laughing harshly] Now you see me as I truly am!
Kyle
We'd better get out of here. [outside, Cartman and Kenny stop wrestling and witness the Wall-Mart rumbling and there's lighting flying around it. Inside, Stan and Kyle make their way to the front doors]
Chef
[panicking] Get out! It's gonna blow! [the shoppers pay heed]
Stan
Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!
Randy
Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
Kyle
The Wall-Mart is imploding! Everybody out NOW! [the shoppers and employees now bolt for the doors and run out as an M in Mart falls down.]
Outside on the parking lot, night. The building begins to collapse as everyone gathers in the parking lot. The building distorts, folds up and implodes into a shining blue dot, then reappears as crap, which falls to the ground where the Wall-Mart once stood. Cartman looks on in astonishment, then cracks up and walks away.
Herbert Garrison
[proudly] Boys, you did it! You killed the Wall-Mart! [the crowd cheers]
Gerald
How did you do it, Kyle?
Kyle
All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
Chef
We know how to destroy it now. Spread the word to all the towns! [nearby, a soldier sits at the ready to send out the news on a telegraph]
Randy
Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
Kyle
Duh.
Randy
You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
Gerald
Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street! [the crowd approves and marches down the street]
Jim's Drugs, later. He reopens for business and the crowd flocks to his store. Later, the small store is replaced by a larger two-story building, which in turn is replaced by a huge building reminiscent of the departed Wall-Mart, which in turn leads to Jim's Drugs' demise by fire.
Crowd
...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.
Randy
All right, let's not make that mistake again.
Herbert Garrison
Yeah, lets all shop over at True Value!
Crowd
Let's go! Yeah! [the crowd moves to the store as one]
End of Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes

Pre-School
South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings. Some fourth graders chat in the hall as Wendy passes by: Clyde talking to Kenny and Kyle.
Clyde
Yeah, and it was called Man from Atlantis, and he had like, webbed fingers... [Stan rushes up to them and grabs Kyle by the coat]
Stan
Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
Kyle
Okay, hang on a second I-
Stan
[pulls Kyle away] Right now, goddamnit!
Kyle
All right, all right! [Stan pulls him further away until there's no one around them] Dude, what is the matter with you?
Stan
[the look of fear is strong on his face] Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. [the boys are suddenly afraid]
Kenny
(WHAT??!!!?)
Kyle
Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!
Stan
Yeah! He just got paroled!
Kyle
Oh, no! No!
Cartman
Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
Kyle
Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
Cartman
Really? That's cool. When did- [realizes what Kyle has just said and stops completely in place] What did you say? [rushes up to Kyle] Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
Kyle
Yeah.
Cartman
Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
Stan
What the hell are we gonna do??
Butters
[runs up to the boys] Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
Cartman
It's true.
Butters
Oh Jesus, Oh Christ in Heaven, I gotta hide! [rushes off to do that, past the other kids in the hall to the front door...] Uh, oh boy! [bursts through the front doors and runs away babbling]
Cartman
He's gonna come for us, you guys. We are dead men.
Kyle
Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool
Flashback to preschool days. It's playtime, and the kids are busy doing things, sliding and such.
Toddler Stan
Dude, let's play Fireman.
Toddler Kyle
Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.
Toddler Cartman
Jews can't be firemen.
Toddler Kyle
Shut up, fat ass!
Toddler Cartman
Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
Toddler Kenny
(How about we put a real fire out?)
Toddler Stan
Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
Toddler Cartman
But how do we start a fire?
Kyle
Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! [a shot of Trent beating up another kid with a play hammer. He delivers two blows]
Trent
Say Uncle!
Boy
Uncle!
Trent
[two more blows] Say Uncle!!!!!!
Boy
Uncle! [satisfied, Trent lets the boy go, and Stan and the others advance to him]
Trent
[turns around] What do you shitheads want?!
Kyle
Do you know how to start a fire?
Trent
Sure! I burn lots stuff.
Stan
Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
Kyle
We're firemen!
Trent
Do you fuckheads even know how to put out a fire?
Stan
Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
Cartman
Don't worry, Trent.
Trent
All right, fine. [walks back to the table, grabs a sheet of paper, crumples it up, and lays it down on the floor. He sets it on fire]
Butters
[approaches] Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.
Cartman
Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
Butters
Oh, all right then. [turns around and walks off. The sheet catches fire]
Stan
Wow, cool!
Kyle
Code 7! Bring in the firemen!
Stan
[walks up to the crumples sheet] Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang! [drops his pants and begins pissing on the paper] Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! [the other boys come and imitate the fire truck noises while pissing on the paper. Trent looks on.]
Stan
We're heroes!
Kyle
[smiles] We saved the school!
Trent
[sees that the fire is spreading] Put it out!
Teacher
[a female, notices the fire and arrives] Trent Boyett, what have you done now?!
Trent
They said they could put it out!
Teacher
Children, get back away, now! [shoos the boys away, then tries to smother the fire out with a blanket. The blanket catches fire, and so does she.] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! [runs from the blanket, then twirls in her own flames as the alarm goes off] I'M BUUURNIIIING!!!
Stan
Put it out, put it out! [Cartman runs up to their teacher and starts pissing on her. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny follow suit]
South Park Elementary, moments later, still in the flashback. The teacher is being put in an ambulance.
Paramedic
Come on, hurry! We've gotta get her to the hospital! [the paramedics hop into the ambulance and drive off, siren blaring]
Stan
Dude, we are in so much trouble!
Kyle
My mom is gonna break my legs!
Cartman
Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
Stan
That's true.
Officer
You boys! Trent is trying to tell us the fire was your idea.
Stan
No!
Kyle
Not us. We're good kids.
Trent
Tell them it was an accident: you thought you could put it out.
Cartman
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Officer
I thought so. All right, that's it, Trent. You're going to Juvenile Hall for a long time!
Trent
[pleading as he passes Butters] Butters, you saw! Tell them what happened!
Butters
U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
Trent
You'd better pray I never get out of Juvenile Hall! You'd better all pray! [the officer wrestles him into the patrol car and closes the door]
Kyle
Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
Cartman
Whatever. That's like five years from now.
Stan
Yeah, who cares?
The Boys
[cheering] All right, yeah, woohoo, we did it!
The flashback ends and the boys are shown in the hall again.
Stan
Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
Cartman
Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
Kyle
We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
Stan
Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now. [a soft noise is heard, and in rolls a futuristic wheelchair, encasing Ms. Claridge]
The Boys
Hello, Ms. Claridge. [she turns to face them]
Stan
[nervously] Are you having a nice day, Ms. Claridge? [a yellow button on the machine lights up and beeps. She turns left and rolls away]
Cartman
You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
Kyle
Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
Juvenile Hall, outside, day, out in the desert. The sky looks smoggy.
Juvenile Hall, inside. The gates in the hall roll back and a mean Trent walks forward. On his right shoulder is written "Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord." Above the writing is a cross. On his left shoulder is a skull surrounded by the words "Never Forget." He approaches the check-out desk.
Warden
[holds up a manila envelope] Everything that you had when you were first brought in here will now be returned. [slices the envelope open and the goods pour out. He then gives each good to Trent after mentioning it] One Crayola eight-pack with crayon sharpener. One pair of plastic round-tipped scissors. One marble, blue. And one [snaps the blade open] switch-blade knife with "Kill all betrayers" written on the blade, black. [snaps the blade closed again and hands it to Trent. Trent makes his way past the desk and heads for the exit.] Trent! Where are you gonna do? [Trent stops]
Trent
I gots some business to take care of. [leaves]
Butters' house, day. In his darkened room, Butters trembles in fear on the floor next to his bookcase. A knock is heard at his door.
Butters
Hah! [the door opens and his parents enter.]
Stephen
Butters? [a view of the room from their position doesn't show Butters anywhere. Butters peeks out from behind the bookcase]
Butters
Hwell. Oh, uh, hi Dad.
Stephen
Butters, what is wrong with you??
Butters
Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all.
Linda
You've been shut up in your room for days, Butters. You need to go outside, go play.
Butters
Uh... outside? No way! [hides again]
Linda
Why not?
Butters
[pops up] N-no reason! [hides again]
Stephen
Butters, we have had it with your moping around! You're gonna go outside and you're gonna play, right now!
Butters
But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
Butters' house, front porch. He's kicked out of the house and the door shuts closed on him. He fiddles his fingers around nervously.
Stephen
Butters, play! [Butters is frozen by something he sees across the street] Start playing right now, young man! [Butters begins to move around, and his father leaves the window. Butters does the Hokey Pokey, but notices the street again and freezes. Across the street, Trent looks right at him]
Butters
Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa! [grabs the door handle and tries to go inside again, only to find it locked. He pounds on the door] Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now! [Trent marches across the street and approaches Butters.] Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad! [Butters pounds on the door again] Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! [Inside, on the sofa, Chris reads the newspaper, Linda reads a book]
Linda
What on earth is the matter with him?
Stephen
Just keep the door locked, honey. Butters can't be a house hermit his whole life.
Butters
Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
Linda
I just can't stand to hear him scream like that. I'm gonna go upstairs. [rises from the sofa and heads upstairs]
Butters
Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it- [stops and turns around. He's face to face with Trent. Butters begins talking nervously] Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
Trent
[beat] Five years. It's been five long, miserable years.
Butters
Look, Trent, I know- I know you're awful sore about... pre- muh- pr-preschool and all, but... well that was a long time ago. I mean, we were just kids. [Trent is unmoved] Uhhh... p-lease don't hurt me, Trent. I-I'll give you anything you want. You name it!
Trent
Can you give me back my time?! Huh?! Can you do that?! Kindergarten, first grade, second?! Can you give me that?!
Butters
Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
Trent
I'm gonna give you something you didn't give me: a five-second head-start.
Butters
No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
Trent
Four seconds!
Butters
Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
Trent
Three seconds!
Butters
Ohhh hamburgers! [runs away]
Hell's Pass hospital, day. Butters wasn't fast enough. In a recovery room, his parents stand at his bedside.
Linda
Thanks so much for coming to visit Butters in the hospital, boys. It means a lot to him. [the boys just stand there with their jaws dropped, awed at what they see before them. Dr. Doctor comes in with a clipboard]
Stephen
What happened to him, Doctor?
Dr. Doctor
From the test results, it would appear your child was tortured by a bully. He received a massive snuggie, his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him. He also received two Indian sunburns on his forearms, a charlie horse on the thigh, and a second-degree titty twister. And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one. [the boys are more frightened after hearing this] It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride.
Linda
What's that?
Dr. Doctor
We aren't sure. We only know that... there is no cure.
Linda
If only we had let him in! [faces Stephen] Why didn't we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help?? [begins to sob]
Stephen
Now, honey, we were trying to read. [the boys walk over to an adjacent room]
Cartman
We've got to tell them who did this, you guys. We're gonna get it as bad as Butters!
Kyle
That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
Cartman
Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
Stan
Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
Cartman
[now yelling] How the hell are condoms gonna help us?! [the adults in the recovery room look at Cartman] Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. [the adults turn their attention back to Butters]
Stan
I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! [the boys run off]
A riverbed. There's graffiti along the banks and sixth graders ride their bikes all around the riverbed.
Sixth Grader 1
I'm gonna jump the wall of fire. [makes motorcycle noises and jumps a low ramp and a small fire, landing safely] Yeah, that was sweet!
Sixth Grade Leader
Hey, look! [before him, Stan and friend approach]
Kyle
Dude, we shouldn't be here!
Stan
Stay cool, guys. If anybody can protect us from Trent Boyett, it's the sixth graders.
Sixth Grade Leader
Stupid little Fourthies! [leads the other sixth-grade boys towards the fourth-graders and circles them, then stops in front of them] What are you little Fourthies doin' in our hangout?!
Stan
We've come to... ask you for help.
Sixth Grade Leader
Help?! [he and the other sixth graders laugh heartily]
Kyle
We need you to protect us... from a bully.
Sixth Grade Leader
Yeah? And what do we get for it? [Stan nudges Cartman forward]
Cartman
[pulls each item from his backpack and presents it as he mentions it] A twelve-pack of Dr. Pepper, A Shoots & Ladders game used only three times, DVD of Harry Potter 2, and a coupon for a free side of fries with a purchase of any deluxe hamburger at Red Robin. [places it at the top of the small tower he's built] All this can be yours. [the Sixth Grade Leader steps off his bike, approaches Cartman, and throws the tower aside]
Sixth Grade Leader
You're gonna have to do better than that, Fourthies!
Kyle
Well... [the fourth-graders take a step back] Well, what do you want?
Sixth Grade Leader
You're Stan Marsh, right?
Stan
Yeah.
Sixth Graders
OOOOOoooOoOooo! [Stan develops a worried face]
Sixth Grade Leader
We want a picture of your mom's boobs! [cups his hands over his chest]
Sixth Graders
Yeah. Awesome.
Stan
What?!
Sixth Grader 2
Your mom has the sweetest bewbs ever.
Sixth Grader 3
Yeah! I totally wanna suck your mom's tits.
Stan
Dude, weak!
Sixth Grade Leader
Come back with a naked picture of your mom!
Stan
[after some thought] No!
Sixth Grade Leader
Then we aren't helpin' you!
Kyle
Wait! We'll do it.
Sixth Grade Leader
It'd have to be a good picture, too! [the sixth-graders make motorcycle noises and ride off. This sixth grader does a wheelie] So long, Fourthies!
Cartman
Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
Trent makes makeshift barbells out of rods and solid disks and begins pumping iron.
South Park, Main Street. A couple and Ms. Claridge pass each other.
Woman 1
That's the preschool teacher, Ms. Claridge. Poor woman suffered such horrible burns she can only communicate by... beeping once for yes and twice for no. [Ms. Claridge stops at a corner waiting to cross the street. Another couple approaches her and flanks her on either side]
Woman 2
Oh hello, Ms. Claridge. Nice day, isn't it? [Ms. Claridge's machine blinks once, so yes]
Man 2
Need help across the street, Ms. Claridge? [Ms. Claridge's machine blinks two, so no] Well all right then. [the light turns green and the couple crosses the street. Ms. Claridge does as well, but it's slow going for her. Her wheelchair slows down and her power indicator drops to zero. She stuck in the middle of the street in the crosswalk]
Man 3
[walks over to help her] Ms. Claridge, you all right? [silence, as there's no power for her light to blink] You can talk to me, Ms. Claridge. I understand: one beep for yes and two for no. Don't you think you should get out of the street? [again, no response] Look you, you don't have to be so cold. I'm just trying to help. [no response. The man gets annoyed] Oooo, sorry! [the man walks on to the other side of the street, quite annoyed at Ms. Claridge. Cross traffic begins, and the cars beep at Ms. Claridge to move out of the way. She's stuck]
A doorbell rings. Mrs. Broflovski approaches and opens the door. Trent faces her with his knife in hand.
Trent
Can Kyle come out and play?
Sheila
Oh, Kyle isn't home right now, hon.
Trent
Thank you, ma'am. [turns and walks away]
Stan's house. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit at the dining table. Cartman is dressed as a woman.
Stan
You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
Cartman
I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange. [crosses his arms] You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
Stan
But mom, my teacher will-
Cartman
Nononono, you gotta go [softly, sweetly] "But Mo-o-o-om."
Stan
[normal] But Mo-o-o-
Cartman
[with more feeling] "But Mo-o-o-om."
Stan
This is hopeless!
Kyle
Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
Stan
That's sick, dude! I'm not taking a picture of my mom's boobs!
Kenny
[volunteers] (I'll do it!)
Stan
No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
Kyle
What else has big round squishy globes? [they look at Cartman, who looks up into space]
Living room, moments later. Cartman stands on a stool and squats down. Kyle has a set of instructions and Stan has a marker. Kenny stands as a witness.
Cartman
Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my ass cheeks.
Kyle
[checks the book] No, the nipples are more in the middle, see? [holds the book out for the others to see.]
Cartman
Yeah, but Stan's mom is old; that means her nipples... sag more to the bottom now.
Stan
How do you know?!
Cartman
Will you guys trust me? I know this stuff!
Stan
All right, fine. [draws some nipples on Cartman's ass, checking the book to be sure. He then steps back]
Kyle
Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.
Kenny
(Oh yeah!) [walks up and puts a necklace above the new nipples, then steps back. Stan frames the image with his hands, then has Kyle step into his spot to take a couple of pictures.]
Kyle
[lowers the camera] God, I hope this works.
The ravine, day. The sixth graders are there again, riding up and down the concrete slopes. Stan and his friends approach.
Stan
Excuse me!
Sixth Grade Leader
What do you want now?!
Stan
[steps forward] We, we got it. [pulls out the photo. The sixth graders ride up to the boys]
Sixth Grader 4
You got a picture of your mom's bewbs?
Sixth Grader 5
No way!
Sixth Grader 2
[walks up and takes the photo, then walks back to the group, looking at it] Hey, hold on a second! [the boys are scared] These are like the hottest tits I've ever seen!
Sixth Grader 8
Whoa!
Sixth Grader 4
Check them out!
Sixth Grader 2
[walks up and grabs is from #6] Give me that! [looks] Whoa! I knew she had a hot rack!
Sixth Graders
Yeah. Sure does. Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
Sixth Grader 3
Oh yeah, those are so hot. [fondles his groin] Oooohhh
Kyle
[the boys look at each other] Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
Sixth Grade Leader
[someone else has the picture now] Oh all right, we'll let this Trent Boyett know that if he messes with you, he's messin' with us!
Cartman
All right!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Cartman
You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
Kenny
(All right!)
Sixth Grader 9
I need three minutes alone with the picture behind the bushes.
Sixth Grader 2
I get to take the picture behind the bushes after you.
Sixth Grade Leader
[grabs the picture] I'm takin' it to the bushes first! [the others follow]
Stan
Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
Kyle
[after some thought] Naw.
The intersection. Ms. Claridge is still there. The boys exit an ice cream parlor with ice cream cones and walk down the street.
Kyle
Man, I would have loved to seen to seen the look on Trent Boyett's face when all the sixth graders showed up!
Cartman
Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
Stan
Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing? [she's still in the crosswalk] Ms. Claridge?
Man 4
[stops and walks up to the boys] She won't talk to anybody, boys. Some say... she's just given up hope. [walks on. The boys move on as well and round a corner]
Cartman
Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a- [drops his cone in fright] Huh?! [before them is a pile of mangled bikes]
Hell's Pass Hospital, later. The boys enter the emergency room and see it full of cots. The sixth graders are there, some injured more than others. The emergency room personnel have their hands full.
Dr. Doctor
Jesus Christ, I've never seen so many Indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life! [sees a nurse and motions to her] Get a cold towel on that pink belly!
Nurse 1
Doctor, we have another snuggie here!
Dr. Doctor
Over there! [points to a clear area, then goes to another cot on which a sixth grader grabs his left ear in pain. A nurse is there as well] Another wet willie?
Nurse 2
Worst one yet.
Sixth Grader
It's all slimy and spitty! [becomes incomprehensible and cries out in pain]
Dr. Doctor
Give the poor kid some morphine. [the nurse reaches for a syringe and does as told. The boys approach the cot on which the leader of the sixth graders lies]
Stan
Dude, what happened?
Sixth Grade Leader
We... told him not to mess with you guys... We told him... you paid us.
Kyle
Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! [the leader suffers a cramp and groans]
Dr. Doctor
Boys, you have to let him rest. Some mean kid gave him a Texas Chili Bowl.
Stan
What's that?
Dr. Doctor
It involves Tabasco sauce, a telephone, and the anus. [the boys are flabbergasted] I don't know what kind of kid would do this to other people; I only know that I wouldn't ever want to be on that kid's bad side. [walks away. The boys leave the hospital]
Hell's Pass Hospital, outside.
Stan
We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
Cartman
He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. [breathes a silent sigh]
Kyle
We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
Stan
No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
Kyle
From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
Stan
[looks down] There is... one person.
Stan's house, living room. Shelly is watching TV with a bowl of soup on her lap. Stan and friends enter and approach.
Stan
Shelly?
Shelly
Shut up, turd! I'm watching television!
Stan
Shelly, you're my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.
Shelly
I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!
Stan
Shelly [hesitates, begins to tear up] Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. [begins to cry. Shelly notices, puts her bowl aside, hops off the sofa, and walks up to Stan]
Shelly
[in Stan's face] Stop crying, turd! Now, who's gonna kill you?
Stan
Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
Shelly
Oh, you are such stupid turds.
Stan
We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
Shelly
Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That's my job.
Kyle
So you're gonna help us?
Shelly
Yes, but I'm gonna want something in return.
Cartman
A picture of your mom's boobs?
Shelly
Shut up, turd! [all four of the boys stand back in fear] You're going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!
Stan
Admit it was our fault?
Shelly
You can't run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I'll protect you from this Trent turd. [the boys aren't so sure apologizing will do any good]
The intersection. Ms. Claridge is still there. No one has moved her. Cars move past her, honking at her, and two men and a woman approach the corner facing her.
Man 5
Ms. Claridge, the people in town are really worried about you. [no reply]
Woman 3
Look, if you're having some kind of problem, you have to be able to talk to people. [no reply]
Man 6
Just tell us this: do you trust that we want what's best for you, yes or no? [no reply]
Man 5
All right, fine! But someday you're gonna have to learn to let people in! [the three walk away] Bitch. [Stan and his friends approach the corner and walk up to Ms. Claridge.]
Stan
Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. [no reply]
Kyle
The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
Cartman
A lot of stupid things that we regret.
Kenny
(And it's time for us to come clean.) [no reply]
Stan
See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."
Trent
[appearing behind them] I've been lookin' for you! [the boys turn and jump upon seeing him. Kenny tightens his hood.] Five years I've been waitin' for this day.
Cartman
Aaaaaaaah!
Stan
Trent, look: We've realized our mistake! [Trent advances, the boys back up]
Cartman
Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. [the boys hide behind Ms. Claridge's wheelchair, Trent goes around the other side and faces them behind the chair]
Trent
You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison you've been enjoying nice, normal lives!
Kyle
Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! [the boys back up some more, away from the intersection]
Trent
Don't tell me that! I heard about the things you've done! But there were no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I DIDN'T GET TO FIGHT A HUGE MECHANIC BARBRA STREISAND!! NO ACCIDENTAL TRIPS TO AFGANISTAN FOR TRENT BOYETT!! [advances. Cartman pulls out a taser gun as the other boys fall in behind him]
Cartman
Stay away from us, Trent!
Stan
What is that?
Cartman
It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse. [steps forward] Just back off, man!
Trent
Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with.
Cartman
I am not going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!
Trent
You don't even know how to use that! [advances on Cartman, who fires the taser but misses.]
The taser tips hit Ms. Claridge's wheelchair and begin charging her battery up. Excess power causes the wheelchair to spin twice around and go off to the corner she was facing. She hits Little Gas Shack and blows up three propane tanks just outside the store. Those tanks in turn blow up the store. Ms. Claridge catches fire and spins around a few more times. Her button blinks twice for no and she crosses back across the street, crashing into a Pets-U-Luv store. A bunch of cats attack her and she pulls back out of the store. She spins again a few more times and a policeman pulls up in his cruiser. Ms. Claridge rolls down the street and shears off a fire hydrant. She gets stuck atop the pipe and water shoots up and engulfs her. Moments later the ambulance pulls up and the paramedics prepare to put Ms. Claridge into the cargo area of the vehicle.
Officer 2
So, Trent, you just had to finish off your old preschool teacher, eh?
Trent
No! They did it! [silence for a few seconds]
Cartman
Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
Officer 2
Ms. Claridge, did Trent Boyett do this to you? [two beeps, so no] Yes, yes. Take him away!
Trent
[a blond officer arrests him] No! You've gotta listen to me! [nope. He's hauled away and the gathered crowd disperses]
Kyle
Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
Cartman
Whatever, that's like five years from now.
Stan
Yeah, who cares?
The Boys
Yeah, woohoo!
Cartman
We did it! [walks over to the side of the cruiser Trent is sitting in] So long, Trent! Have a nice time! [Trent grits his teeth in anger as Cartman dances] Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! [turns around and lowers his pants, then shakes his bare at him] Hahahahahaaahaaa! [he forgot to remove the nipple markings from it. Trent grows livid. The six-graders arrive and carry Cartman away]
Sixth Grader 2
Hey, hold on a second!
Cartman
Uh oh.
Sixth Grader 2
Bewbs!
Sixth Grader 1
Omigod!
Sixth Graders
Boobs!
Sixth Grader 1
[as the others argue over them] I'm taking them to the bushes!
Sixth Grader 2
I'm taking them to the bushes first!
Cartman
Hah! Hey!
End of Pre-School

Quest for Ratings
An announcer introduces the news over some action-type music.
Announcer
This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now, Super School News. The news made for students, by students.
Jimmy
Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
Cartman
And I'm Rick Cartman.
Jimmy
The price of milk money will go up next Monday to 49 cents. The school claims the added money is due to the cow shortage in South Park County.
Cartman
Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
Reporting from the cafeteria, Stan.
Stan
Eric, it looks as though the school will be serving a chicken cutlet. Now, that's traditionally a uh-a white meat chicken... breast, if you will, that has been breaded, and then cooked. I've been told there will also be tater-tots and a vegetable dish. This is really shaping up to be a ah-ah one fantastic lunch. Eric?
Cartman
[serious pose] ...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
Reporting from the sidewalk in front of the school, Butters.
Butters
Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
Cartman
All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
Butters
[over a speaker] Will do.
Jimmy
More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.
Token
[in front of a weather map] Jimmy and Eric, it looks like a massive snow storm is headed South Park's way. I asked my dad last night and he said that he heard the snow storm is expected on Tuesday. Guys?
Cartman
Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
Kyle
[at a small desk, for Sports] Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
Cartman
Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
Jimmy
And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- [lilts] Ehehehehe [normal] El-Elementary.
Stan
[returning from the kitchen to serve as cameraman] And we're... cut! [turns off the camera]
Cartman
All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. [the reporters gather in studio]
Butters
Boy, that was a great episode!
Stan
Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
Mr. Meryl
[enters the studio] Boys, I'm afraid I have some bad news. The school has to cancel your show.
Kyle
What?!
Jimmy
For God's sake,why Mr. M-M-Meryl?!
Mr. Meryl
Well, the students just aren't watching ya. Your rating was only a four this whole week.
Cartman
How many students is that?
Mr. Meryl
Four. [holds up four fingers] Four students watch your show. And meanwhile, Craig's show is getting a 57!
Stan
...Craig's show??
Cartman
What is that butthole doing now?!
Mr. Meryl
Oh, it's brilliant! It's all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens. [pops a VHS tape into the player and the video starts]
Craig
[on tape, as the name of the show is displayed] Animals Close-Up With A Wide Angle Lens. [the video goes on to show close-ups of dogs and cats.]
Stan
But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
Mr. Meryl
It's what the students want, and it's cheaper to make than your show. Just one person and a video camera. Craig is a genius. Uh-sorry, kids. [walks between and past them]
Jimmy
[stopping Mr. Meryl] But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much.
Mr. Meryl
Kids don't care about the news, boys. It's boring. Kids wanna see animals, close-up, with a wide angle lens!
Cartman
Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
Mr. Meryl
I'm sorry, kids. Y-y-you should be proud of what you've done. It's just that it's kind of gay. [walks off]
Cartman
...You're gay!
Whistlin' Willy's Pizza Gulch, day. The boys are seated for lunch: Jimmy, Butters, Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Token. Other kids are there as well.
Butters
[his head resting on his right hand] Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
Stan
Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
Whistlin' Willy
[approaches the table] Hello boys, ready to do some whistlin'? [begins to whistle]
Cartman
Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
Whistlin' Willy
[enthusiastically] If you want a pizza, you've gotta whistle. [whistles] Come on! [whistles some more, then stops. The boys whistle back, but slowly and flatly] There you go! [sets the pizza down on the table and leaves]
Cartman
[softly] God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
Stan
[look at Cartman, but notices someone else] Hey, look, Craig just walked in. [Craig enters to cheers from the other kids in the restaurant and waves back to them. Several kids take pictures of Craig]
Bradley
Yeah!
Kid 1
Hey look, it's Craig!
Kevin
Hey, Craig, over here!
Kyle
Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
Craig
[sees the other boys and addresses them] Oh hey guys. Heard about your news show being cancelled.
Cartman
Go play with yourself, Craig.
Craig
Yeah, well, I've got an overall deal with the school, heh. They're paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows.
Stan
Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! [holds up a fist with thumb and index finger just a centimeter apart]
Craig
[throws the gesture back at Stan] This much more than you had!
Craig walks off with his fans. They head to Willy's VIP Lounge, which is just a large corner booth. A waiter guards access to the lounge and Craig approaches.
Craig
Hey, a round of root beers for everyone! On me! [the other kids cheer and the waiter opens the lounge. The kids pour into place, including Kenny.]
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Cartman
[catches up to Kenny] Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
Kenny
(Craig just asked me to do his show, geez.)
Cartman
You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! [Kenny flashes back to Cartman gloating about their news show]
 "Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!"

[The flashback ends] Ah whatever, Kenny! [walks away]

Craig
Hey gang, I brought the new episode of wide angle, close-up animals. [the kids cheer again. Clyde walks up and takes the tape from Craig]
Clyde
[excitedly runs towards the video wall] Put it, put it up on the, monitors! [puts the tape into the player and more close-up footage of animals is shown]
Kids
Cuuute. [a kitten's face is shown] Super cuuute.
Kyle
[turns back to the table] Gah, I just don't get it.
Token
Wow, those animals are pretty cute.
Stan
Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
Kyle
Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
Butters
Well, what are we waitin' for?!
Stan
Come on, guys! [the boys leave]
Student Conference Room 1-F, later. Inside, A sign above the chalkboard reads "Idea Room." Cartman has his feet up on the table. Stan paces the floor.
Stan
All right, we all need to come up with ideas for our show.
Kyle
How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
Cartman
It should be Sexy News.
Token
Action News!
Stan
Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.
Kyle
Maybe the problem is we don't have very good stories to report on.
Cartman
Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
Butters
Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
Cartman
Nice, Butters, write that down!
Butters
[enunciates each word as he writes it] Lie about celebrities.
Stan
We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
Cartman
And panda bears for the preschoolers.
Stan
Good!
Kyle
Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
Token
Yeah! We should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive.
Butters
Oh, boy!
Jimmy
Fellas, are you sure all of this is eh-ethical?
Cartman
We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
Stan
All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
Butters
Sexy Action School News Team, ho! [the boys leave their seats and head out the doors. Cartman stops Token]
Cartman
Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you? [takes Token by the arm and walks him away from the door] Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
Token
Huh?
Cartman
You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha-, how should I say... white. [Sees that Token isn't following] Token, all the great African-Americans news people have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
Announcer
This is South Park Elementary School closed-circuit television. And now, [dramatic fanfare] Time with the Sexy Action School News! [a splashy logo appears with a small explosion behind the logo, then a female silhouette walking across the screen behind the words]
Cartman
Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
Reporting from Raisins, Stan Marsh. He's surrounded by Raisins with shorter shorts and tank tops.
Raisins Girls
Woohoo!
Stan
Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
Raisins Girls
Woowhoowoo!
Cartman
And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
Token
[deeper, whiter voice] No tornadoes, Eric, but interestingly enough, there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the Park County Valley. Should bring us some chilly days ahead. [grins and points his index fingers at the camera]
Jimmy
The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
Cartman
[rudely interrupting] Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
Kyle
[at a different, flashier desk] Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman [his picture is shown], pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner [her picture is shown] stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
Cartman
[cracks up with laughter, then holds up a finger] One testicle! [pounds the desk and laughs] What an asshole! [a short jingle is heard]
Token
Uh-oh, looks like it's Panda Bear Madness Minute! [circus music plays as panda-suited mascots and the other reporters join Token in the weather area and dance. A pulsating logo appears]
Cartman
Oh yeah, Panda Bear Madness! And now, let's get a look at the celebrity watch, with Butters.
Jimmy
[dismayed] This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.
Student Conference Room 1-F.
Cartman
All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
Stan
Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
Token
That is a terrific idea, Stan, A-Okay.
Jimmy
[walks into the room with a tape] Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show. [the boys look at Cartman]
Cartman
Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got skidmarks Monday.
Jimmy
But this is real news!
Cartman
It's boring news, Jimmy.
Jimmy
How do you know?! You you haven't s-seen it yet!
Cartman
All right, tell me about it.
Jimmy
Well, in the interview, Mr. Cheney tells me all about how the-
Cartman
[yawns loudly] Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
Jimmy
Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!
Stan
No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
Kyle
We're making the news more appealing to students.
Jimmy
This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa... the facts! [begins to walk around the table] Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-news reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting? [Cartman then yawns loudly again]
Mr. Meryl's office, Audio-Visual Department.
Mr. Meryl
Boys, first of all, I want to tell you how impressed I am with your ability to get more ratings. Your show beat Close-up Animals with a Wide Angle Lens by three viewers!
The Boys
All right! Woohoo! Awesome! [the boys give each other hugs all around and shake hands]
Stan
I knew we could do it!
Kyle
We beat Close-up Animals!
Cartman
Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! [hugs Butters]
Mr. Meryl
Yes, but unfortunately, you got crushed in the ratings by Craig's new show. [the boys continue cheering, then stop and look at Mr. Meryl]
Stan
Craig's new show?
Mr. Meryl
All the students love it. It's an incredible idea called Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens... Wearing Hats. Take a look. [clicks Play. The boys turn around to look at the monitor. The animals on display now are wearing hats, but it's the same show as before otherwise.] That Craig is a freakin' genius, I tell ya. He's like... an idea machine.
Butters
Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
Mr. Meryl
I'm afraid it's worse than that, boys. I'm gonna have to give you all F's in Extracurricular AV Class. You have to learn now how important ratings are!
Stan
Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.
Mr. Meryl
Yes. [begins to rock in his seat] And I guess your best wasn't good enough. [shows them the door]
In the hall. Mr. Meryl closes the door behind them.
Stan
[stunned] I don't believe it.
Cartman
I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
Butters
Stupid news hair! [He removes his wig and kicks it away.]
Jimmy
Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down.
Kyle
Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.
Stan
Yeah. To save our show, all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever!
Student Conference Room 1-F. The kid reporters sit around trying to think of something, anything, but all there is is silence.
Kyle
What if we do a show where we- [stops] Uh, no.
Cartman
How about we have us, um... hmmm.
Stan
Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
Butters
Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
Token
We did that!
Jimmy
Wow, coming up with ideas is... hard.
Stan
Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on! [time passes. Stan begins to pace the floor again] How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
Kyle
Uhhh. What if the-?
Cartman
Wait, I've got it. [the boys turn and look at him] Crab people.
Stan
Crab people?
Cartman
They're like half crab, half people, and they live below the ground.
Stan
[looks at Cartman, then gets annoyed] Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
Butters
I know! We should read the funnies! [hops off his chair and goes to a table, on which sits the Sunday Funnies] I always get good ideas from the funnies.
Cartman
[his face buried in his hands] Butters, only gay little dweebs read the funnies!
Butters
Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says "Well that's gonna add another hour to his time." [laughs] Yeah! You guys! [gets no reaction from the other boys] Heh.
Cartman
How about we do a show where we kill Butters? [time marches on and the boys get sleepy, except for Butters]
Butters
[still reading the funnies, giggles, then laughs] So Dagwood says "Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house." [laughs heartily]
Stan
We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.
Cartman
We have crab people. Just sayin'.
Kyle
Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
Token
Cough medicine?
Kyle
That's what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess. They take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads.
South Park Pharmacy, later. The boys are at the cold and flu medicine aisle.
Butters
Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
Kyle
How do we know which one to use?
Stan
Cartman
That sounds perfect.
Jimmy
B-b-bingo!
Pharmacist
Can I help you boys?
Stan
Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
Pharmacist
Whoa, boys! That's not what you need to come up with ideas.
Kyle
It's not?
Pharmacist
No! What you want is Calminex PM. [grabs a similar bottle to the first one and hands it to Kyle] It has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses.
Kyle
Oh, okay.
Pharmacist
Now, if it's more of a lucid, speedy kind of high you're looking for, I do also carry the Daytab Cold and Flu. Then there's the maximum-strength Cortitussin Cough and Cold, but of course, that's only if you really want to trip balls.
Jimmy
Wha-what do you think, fellas?
Stan
I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
Pharmacist
That's the spirit! All right, boys, I'll just need your parents' permission. [the boys look at each other] Kidding! I'm just pulling your legs. Come on over to the register. [goes to the register. The boys follow and see Herbert Garrison and Mr. Slave waiting for the pharmacist]
Herbert Garrison
Oh, looks like somebody else is doin' a little partyin' tonight.
Mr. Slave
Oh, Jesus Christ
Butters
Woo. We aren't havin' a party.
Herbert Garrison
Oh yeah, sure, you're just buyin' that for your bad coughs, right? [fakes a bad cough and nudges Mr. Slave] Us too. [coughs]
Mr. Slave
[coughs] Jesus. [coughs]
Student Conference Room 1-F. Butters and Jimmy sit at a sofa. Jimmy has set his crutches aside and is now drinking the cough syrup.
Kyle
[handing out a few things] All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil. [Stan, Token, and Cartman are on the floor] and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
Butters
[Jimmy hands him a bottle] Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart. [chugs down the cough syrup] Eww, it's all thick and g-gooey.
Cartman
[taps at his notepad several times with a pencil] Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
Kyle
Stan? [Stan's eyes have glazed over and he looks stupefied. From Stan's point of view, the whole world changes. Kyle now has a wolf head with yellow eyes.] Dude, Stan, you all right?
Jimmy
[appears as a yellow figure with multi-colored polka dots all over his body] I think maybe he's f-feeling it.
Cartman
[appears as a blob with echoing voice] Stan, are you getting good ideas?
Butters
Whoa... [stretches out his left hand] I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.
Stan begins his head trip. He sees a tunnel with yellow light, then a flash of plasma, then an animated Mandelbrot design, then a prize-winning dog on a pedestal. A bell sounds. Next, a tunnel with blue light, which ends up at a performance of some sort, a time-lapse shot of rolling clouds, another Mandelbrot animation, a running shot of a meadow, then a wide-angle view of the boys.
Cartman
[with altered voice] Stan? Stan, come on. We're gonna go find a frog. [smiles, turns around and walks away]
Stan then sees time-lapse footage of a ride through a city, then blooming flowers, then time-lapse footage of the reporters walking around the valley, then some weird graphics, then Cartman in degraded colors. Cartman and Kyle speak to him in weird altered voices.
Cartman
Oh dude, I just got the best idea!
Kyle
Me too. [they quickly write their ideas down in their notepads]
Stan then sees an imploding building, then some dancing African women, an explosion in another building, a zoom-pan shot of an African dancer. Next he sees himself and the boys on a sidewalk in downtown.
Butters
Hey! Let's run naked through the street! [Butters rips off his clothes and wig and runs away happily. Kyle, Token, and Cartman stand around with goofy grins on their faces doing nothing.]
Student Conference Room 1-F, later on. Token and Jimmy are in armchairs, Stan stayed on the floor, Kyle, Butters, and Cartman are on the sofa. Butters is in his underwear. All of them are groggy.
Cartman
Dude, this TV show is awesome.
Stan
It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
Kyle
I could watch this for days. [They are watching Craig's show, Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens Wearing Hats]
The Boys
[without enthusiasm] Cuuute. Super cuuute.
Student Conference Room 1-F, next morning. The boys are now asleep. Butters is still in his underwear with his head on Kyle's lap. Stan, sleeping on the floor, wakes up and looks around.
Stan
You guys. You guys, wake up! [the boys are roused]
Kyle
Ah!
Butters
Huh?
Kyle
Butters, get away from me!
Butters
[looks down at his body] Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!
Stan
We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
Cartman
I-I did. I wrote something down. [reaches down and gets his tablet] Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. [shows the drawing to the other boys]
Kyle
I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
Stan
You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
Token
[still groggy] Yeah. It was great.
Stan
No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now. [strokes his chin] I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
Kyle
Jesus, you may be right.
Jimmy
Fellas, this is our chance! Everyone get your hair looking as fantastic as possible. It's time for us to do the most incredible investigative news report of our journalistic lives!
Announcer
This is closed-circuit television for South Park Elementary School. And now, [sudden change of tone and flashy graphics follow] a Sexy Action News Team Special Report: Cough Medicine Abuse in School! [the boys are shown in their news reporter attire and they strike serious poses. Cartman takes off his glasses.] With the Sexy Action School News Team! [a shot of a coffin being lowered into its plot] It's the report you can't afford to miss! [a skull and crossbones appear and a scream is heard. The picture itself takes on a blue hue] And now here is Rick Cartman!
Cartman
[camera pans down to him] They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
Stan
[voice over] They're doing it in the hallways! [a shot of Tweek downing some cough syrup, then jumping in surprise with his iconic yelp and running away] Behind the school! [a shot of the Goth kids downing cough medicine]
Red Goth
Hey, get out of here, you fuckin' dork!
Stan
Even in the girls' bathroom! [a shot of Bebe and Red in the restroom viewed through an air vent. Bebe takes a sip from a bottle of cough medicine, gives it to Red to sip, then notices something in the air vent]
Bebe
[approaches the sink under the vent] Is somebody in there?! I'll tell on you!
Stan
[a shot of Jimmy and Principal Victoria looking at the report] We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
Principal Victoria
Oh my goodness!
Jimmy
P- Principal Victoria, can you explain how your administration fai-failed to see this p-p-pro-o-o... p-p-problem.
Principal Victoria
Well I... we...
Kyle
[steps into view in front of Cartman, who has his arms crossed] So where are students getting all this cough medicine?? [Cartman uncrosses his arms and puts his fists on his hips. Kyle puts his hands behind his back] This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist! [it's the footage from their own visit to the pharmacist for the medicine] Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! [a shot of the pharmacist being escorted out of the store and into a cruiser. Officer Barbrady takes part in the arrest]
Token
The cough companies claim they don't intend for their product to be used by kids to get high! But one look at the packaging tells otherwise. [brings out the first package] Theradryl DM. For kids. [brings out the next package] Dexa Cough, children's formula.
Cartman
And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
Butters
[from the front of the school] Still no celebrities, Eric. Uh, I'll keep my eyes open.
Stan
The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: riddled their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. [a shot of the hallways from the entrance. All the kids are coughing and walking around. Some of them sneeze]
Mr. Meryl's office, later.
Mr. Meryl
Boys, I want to congratulate you on what is perhaps the finest piece of student television I've ever seen. Not only did you get all the students and myself off of couch medicine, but you got a 22 in the ratings!
Kyle
Twenty-two people?! All right!
Craig
[enters and moves past the other boys] You wanted to see me, Mr. Meryl?
Mr. Meryl
Oh yes, Craig. It appears that the ratings for your show are down significantly.
Stan
[knowingly] Gee, what a coincidence.
Jimmy
I wonder... oo-oo.. w-why?
Mr. Meryl
You need to know how important ratings are, Craig, so, I'm going to suspend you from school and request that you have your testicles removed surgically. [Craig's jaw drops.]
Cartman
[gleefully] Haha! In your face, Craig!
Mr. Meryl
You boys are approved for twenty-seven new shows. I want you to come up with an even better idea than the cough medicine story. Get to it!
Student Conference Room 1-F, later on. The boys are seated at the table once again, sitting in silence.
Stan
Nobody has any ideas?
Cartman
This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. [Token and Kyle sit across from him with no ideas either]
Kyle
Dude, bail?
Cartman
...I think bail.
Stan
...Bail. [everyone leaves the table]
Jimmy
Yep, b-b-b-bail. [the room is empty as the door closes off-camera.]
The last scenes are that of "Close-up Animals With a Wide Angle Lens Wearing Hats"
End of Quest for Ratings

Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset
South Park Mall, day. Inside, a crowd awaits a special event. A small stage with "PARIS" written on it in large letters is set up before a red curtain. Wendy and Bebe arrive and make their way to the front.
Bebe
Come on, Wendy, we're gonna miss it!
Wendy
We're gonna miss what?
Bebe
Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall!
Wendy
Who's Paris Hilton?
Red
"Who's Paris Hilton?"
Annie
You don't know?
Announcer
[someone takes a picture as he approaches the mic.] Hello, everyone! The Guess Clothing Company is pleased to have as its new spokesperson model, a woman all you young ones can look up to, Ms. Paris Hilton. [she appears and flashbulbs go off amid squeals from females in the crowd. She then lifts her bra and shows off her breasts]
Bebe
Wow, that's really her! Paris! Over here!
Wendy
I don't get it. What's she do?
Annie
She's super-rich!
Wendy
...But what does she do?
Red
She's totally spoiled and snobby.
Wendy
[annoyed] What does she do?!
Man
[walks by and overhears] She's a whore. [takes his camera and snaps a few pictures]
Paris
[her left eyelid hangs heavy] Hey everyone. Sorry if I'm a little spent. I did a whole lot of partying last night with a LOT of different guys. [coughs semen onto her left fist] Anyway, I'm pleased to be here in Gouth Dark to announce the opening of my brand new store! A store where girls can buy everything they need to be just like me! Stupid Spoiled Whore! [the red curtain drops to reveal the store. The crowd cheers] Have fun, girls. And remember to party, and be super-lame to everybody. G'Bye! [steps aside and off-stage. An assistant awaits with water and a tote bag, which has a Chihuahua in it. She holds out a bottle of water] Give me that! Fucking Christ I need a drink! [vomits out feces, then drinks from the bottle. The assistant arms her with the tote bag] Where's my dog?! [walks off]
Stupid Spoiled Whore, inside. The girls rush in as the doors open and begin to mill around. Bebe leads Red, Annie, and Wendy around. Wendy's still stunned.
Bebe
Wow, look at all this great stuff. Stupid Spoiled Whore clothes, Stupid Spoiled Whore dolls.
Red
[walks up to a display case] Hey, check it out: the new Paris Hilton perfume, Skanque. [grins and holds a heart-shaped bottle with the name on it]
Announcer
Skanque.
Annie
[carrying some clothes] Oh yeah, let's get lots of that!
Wendy
You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?
Red
It's not just Paris: Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Tara Reid, they're all stupid spoiled whores!
Wendy
But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
Bebe
[now with two armloads of clothes] Wendy, get a clue. The only thing more important than being rich is being famous!
Annie
Wow, you really sound like a dumb brat, Bebe.
Bebe
Thanks, Annie! [She, Annie, and Red walk away, and Wendy remains stunned]
South Park Mall, parking lot. Paris's chauffeur holds the limousine door open for her.
Paris
[quickly arrives and enters the limo] God, get me out of this hick town! What a bunch of rednecks! [the driver closes the door, starts up the limo, and drives off. Inside, she picks up her Chihuahua and starts talking to it, caressing it] Everybody's so fucking lame. Except for you, my little Tinkerbell. You love my vewy much, don't you? How much you wuv me? I'm gonna dress you up like a bunny, and then I'm gonna dress you up like a little princess. You're mine forever! [her cellphone rings and she answers it, releasing Tinkerbell.] Whatever! Oh, hey, Kasey. Oh, another stupid store opening at some lame cowboy town. [Tinkerbell jumps down from the seat and walks away dejected] Oh, it's so fucking stupid, this whole town stinks like cows. [Tinkerbell is up on the divider and looks down] I can't wait to get out of here! Grody!
Tinkerbell drops down onto the front seat
Paris
They have the lamest stores, too. [... walks over to the driver and digs around his right coat pocket ...] I'm gonna go to Rome for the weekend, I think. I dunno, Rome or Tokyo, either way it'll be totally boring. [... and digs out a small gun from the pocket.] Stupid. [coughs some semen onto her left hand] Hagh. [Tinkerbell carries the gun back to the back seat...] I need to get wasted. I haven't had a drink in like fourteen minutes. Why is everybody so stupid anyway? [... and sets the gun down long enough to put the barrel against its chin. Tinkerbell then tries to set the gun off with her right hind leg. That doesn't work, so she stands the gun up on its butt and tries again] I flashed all these hicks with my boobs; you should've seen the look on their faces! Stupid redneck idiots!
The gun goes off and Tinkerbell falls over, her brain and blood splattering on the seat's back and rear window.
Paris
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Chauffeur
Oh dear...
Paris
Another dog killed itself!
A house. Two girls sit at a dining table doing nothing. Wendy enters and addresses them.
Wendy
Hey Jessie [the blonde], Hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange.
Jessie
Sure, Wendy. We were just trying to think of something to do.
Wendy
Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?
Jessie
Nah, that sounds really dull.
Kal
Hey, I know! Let's make a videotape of us having sex with boys! [Jessie likes the idea]
Wendy
What?!
Kal
I just got [brings out a box] the Stupid Spoiled Whore video playset! [the set comes from Letcher Price and "Makes you a whore and so much more!"]
Singers
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset!

Kal
You can make videos that get out on the Internet!
Jessie
Yeah! [Kal puts on some makeup as Jessie looks on]
Singers
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Show the whole world what a slut you are!

Announcer
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset comes with video camera, night-vision filter, play money, cellphone, and sixteen hits of ecstasy. [nine hits are shown] [The playset box is shown again, then Kal is shown on the cellphone]
Singers
Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset! Let everyone see your coo-ooch!

[The playset box is shown again, then Kal is shown on the cellphone]
Kal
I'm pretending to be calling my friends on the cellphone while my man waits for more sex!
Jessie
You're a Stupid Spoiled Whore. [Wendy just turns right and walks away.] Where are you goin', Wendy?
The limousine. Paris is crying over the loss of Tinkerbell.
Paris
Bwaaaaaaa! Waaaaaaaaaaa!
Chauffeur
All right, Ms. Hilton, we'll find you another dog.
Paris
[throws a tantrum] Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Driver
There there now, let's just get you back home, shall we?
Paris
Woooooooooohooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo... [notices something outside] Wait! Wait, stop the car! [the limo proceeds] Stop the car, you fucking moron! [the limo stops] Look at how cuuute. I want that! I want that!
Butters
[playing with some apples on a checkerboard blanket on the front lawn]
Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.

Paris
It's adorable! [exits the limo and closes the door]
Butters
Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!

[Paris approaches him]
Paris
Look at his wittle puff ball! [Butters is surprised] I'm gonna feed you, and take care of you, and call you Mr. Biggles! [kneels down and hugs him]
Butters
My name's Butters.
Paris
Driver, put Mr. Biggles in the car. [the driver appears] I want to find a bear costume for him. Won't he be soo cute dressed up as a bear?
Chauffeur
Paris, I believe this is somebody's child.
Paris
I want it!
Chauffeur
I don't think you can actually-
Paris
I want it! I want it! [rocks back and forth]
Chauffeur
All right, all right, come on- come on, young man.
Butters
Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, "never get into a car with a stranger."
Paris
Well did they say anything about limousines? [Butters thinks about it. An image of his parents appears]
Stephen
Butters, never get into a car with a stranger! Unless it's a limousine.
Butters
Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
Paris
[happily] Get in the limo, Mr. Biggles! We're gonna have a bear costume made for you!
Wendy's house, night. Her parents are watching TV and munching on chips on the sofa. She enters with her head down.
Announcer
And now, back to The Price is Right! [Wendy sighs]
Dad
Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?
Wendy
Mom, Dad, I'm growing concerned about the role models young women have in today's society.
Dad
Oh?
Wendy
It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.
Dad
...Gosh.
Wendy
I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.
Dad
Well, get right on fixing that, sweetie. Wanna watch The Price is Right? [Wendy doesn't answer. Instead, she turns away and walks off slowly, and her parents go back to eating chips]
Wendy
[spins around and walks back] Dad, there's a new store at the mall called "Stupid Spoiled Whore" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!
Dad
[suddenly angered] What?! No daughter of mine is going to dress like a whore! We're marching down to that store right now, young lady!
Stupid Spoiled Whore, moments later. Wendy and her dad enter the store. He looks around.
Mr. Testaburger
Oh my God! Well this place is-! Oh my God! [approaches a line of girls and their mothers.] Mrs. Knitts, you're buying this stuff for your daughter?!
Mrs. Knitts
[giggles] It's what's in right now. I, I can't have my little girl be the only one not in a trend; she'll be unpopular.
Mr. Testaburger
Unpopular?! If she's not a whore?! [Bebe and her mom now pay attention] But these are our girls!
Mrs. Stevens
I think it's empowering for them. I mean, sure, if a man wants to be a whore, it's normal, but if a woman wants to be one, it's wrong. [the other females murmur in agreement]
Woman 1
Yeah, when a man pees standing up, it's normal, but when a woman does it, it's weird.
Females
Yeah! Right!
Woman 2
Yeah, like, when men shave their balls it's fine, but when a woman does it she's straaange.
Females
Yeah! Right! It isn't fair!
Teen Girl 1
All the girls in South Park are gonna be total sluts from now on, so you can just get used to it.
Teen Girl 2
[rubs her ass up against Mr. Testaburger] Yeah. Will you buy me that purse I want over there? I'll do anything, 'cause I'm a whore.
Mr. Testaburger
[more amenable now] Oh, uh sure I can buy a purse.
Wendy
Dad!
Mr. Testaburger
Nope. Wendy, I think they're right. You see, you have to believe in the rights of women. For too long they've had to live a double standard. [enjoying the affection] Oh yeah. I'm sorry I've been so chauvinistic, Wendy. From now on you can have whatever you want from this store, I'll help make you the stupidest, most spoiled whore of them all!
Females
Hooray!
The Stotch house, day.
Stephen
Butters, will you mind telling us why you're dressed up like a bear?!
Butters
[dressed in a bear cub outfit] Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
Stephen
Your girlfriend?
Paris
[enters the scene] There you are, Mr. Biggles! [picks Butters up and hugs him] Aw, I thought I'd lost you! [caresses him] Promise you'll never leave me. [his parents are stunned]
Linda
Butters? You're dating Paris Hilton? You are grounded, mister!
Butters
I'm sorry.
Stephen
[turns his wife around] Uh, sweetheart, isn't Paris Hilton worth a lot of money?
Linda
Chris, she's more than twice Butters' age!
Stephen
Yes, and more than three billion times his net worth. Everybody adores that girl, darling. We should be nice to her too, especially if she's in love with our son! [they turn around]
Linda
Uh, Paris, would you like to have some cocoa with us? [Paris coughs some semen onto her left hand and rubs it against the rug]
Paris
With schnapps and Scotch. [coughs some more semen onto her hand]
The dining table. The four persons are seated around it drinking cocoa, with Paris having a bottle of Scotch alongside the cocoa.
Stephen
So, Paris, I understand you're from the prestigious Hilton family. Very nice hotels.
Paris
I've gotta get outta here. This place is stupid. Where am I? Oh, I wanna take Mr. Biggles with me.
Linda
[stunned again] With you where?
Paris
To live with me forever and ever, you dumb broad. How much?
Linda
How much? For Butters?
Stephen
Butters is our son. He's not for sale.
Paris
I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it. [Butters is afraid. Chris spits out his cocoa and puts down his cup]
Stephen
Excuse me?!
Paris
I said I'll give you two hundred million dollars for it! [Chris spits out his cocoa. Linda does so as well. Paris whips out a checkbook and pen] I'll write you a check for Mr. Biggles right now.
Linda
Chris, is she serious?
Stephen
Ah, Butters, why don't you take Paris up to your room for a little while, uh, Mommy and Daddy have to talk.
Butters
[while Paris writes out a check] Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
Stephen
Butters, right now!
The living room, moments later. Chris paces the floor as Linda watches on.
Linda
We aren't honestly considering this?
Stephen
Darling, Paris is a billionaire. She can give Butters everything he wants. We'd be terrible parents not to consider it.
Linda
But he's our son!
Stephen
I know, darling, but look: we have to think about the rest of the family.
Linda
The rest of the f- you do mean us?
Stephen
Yes, us, the rest of the family.
Upstairs, in Butters' room. The bed looks nice. Paris is now drunk from the Scotch she added to her cocoa.
Paris
What should we do, Mr. Biggles? I drank too much. [falls backward upon the bad] Oh my God, I'm so wasted! [her genitals are exposed] The room's all spinny. I'm... totally passing out. [she falls silent. Butters looks around, then reaches over with his left hand and touches her vagina a few times]
South Park Elementary. The class bell rings and kids clear the hall. Cartman is at his locker, and near him stand five girls. Wendy walks up to them.
Wendy
Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.
Bebe
You wouldn't be interested, Wendy. My parents are out of town, so it's a Stupid Spoiled Whore party.
Wendy
I'm a stupid spoiled whore. [her dress is relaxed: blue jeans and turquoise tank top with one strap over the right shoulder. The girls laugh at her reply]
Annie
Right. Please, Wendy, you're like Class President and stuff!
Red
Yeah, and you get straight A's in school!
Bebe
You're not even spoiled, because your parents give money to charity!
Red
You don't want to go to this party, Wendy! We're inviting all the boys, and we're gonna play Spin the Bottle, and Two Minutes In The Closet, and do ketamine.
Wendy
That's okay.
Annie
Oh, please, do you even know what ketamine is?
Wendy
Yes.
Annie
See? You are too smart.
Red
Yeah. We have no idea what ketamine is.
Bebe
Sorry Wendy. You're just not a whore. Get lost!
Girls
Yeah. [Wendy turns around and walks off sadly. The others laugh at her, then move on to other topics]
Red
Hey, we'd better start inviting boys to the party.
Sally Turner
Oooo, look, here comes Clyde.
Bebe
Party at my house tonight, Clyde. You're invited. [Clyde walks by, wondering what these girls are on about]
Millie
Mmm, I'd like a piece of that!
Red
I wanna do him.
Annie
Oh, yeah. Here comes Kyle. [Cartman, still at his locker, looks over. Kyle passes by]
Sally
Mmm, talk to me, kosher boy. [Cartman turns around to see what the girls see]
Millie
I'd like to twizel his pixie stick.
Bebe
Party at my house tonight, Kyle.
Annie
Tweek and Jason - that'd be a great three-way. [Tweek and Jason walk by]
Red
Yeah, they're invited too.
Sally
Jason has a huge bulge. You're gonna get it, boys.
Bebe
Now here's what I'm talking about. [Token appears and walks by] A little midnight blue!
Millie
Yeah, I'd like to wax his crankshaft!
Annie
Be at Bebe's house, tonight, at seven! [Cartman clears his throat, closes his locker, and walks past the girls. Not one of them says a thing.]
Sally
Look, here comes Kevin. [Kevin appears and walks by]
Bebe
Hey Kevin, party at my house.
Millie
I'd like to gargle his marbles.
Red
Yeah, you said it. [Cartman runs back along the hall in such a way that the girls don't notice]
Sally
See you there, Kev. [Cartman tries again, and the girls notice.]
Cartman
"Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure." [the girls say nothing. Cartman stops, gets angry, and walks back to the first girl he saw, then flips each one of them off. He flips Red off with both hands.] Fuck you Millie, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! [leaves.]
Butters' room. He's gotten interested in Paris' genitals, poking at them.
Butters
Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. [upon hearing a knock on the door, he gasps and stops probing Paris]
Stephen
Ms. Hilton? Uh, Ms. Hilton.
Paris
[awakens and sits up] Eugh. Where am I? Ew! This room's all middle-class and small!
Stephen
Ms. Hilton, we've talked it over all night and... while your offer is enticing, I'm afraid we just can't sell you our son for two hundred million dollars. [Butters smiles] It'll have to be two hundred and fifty million, cash, up front.
Butters
Oh hamburgers!
Paris
Yay! Mr. Biggles, you're mine forever!
Butters
[jumps off the bed and runs to Linda] Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! [the parents look at each other]
Stephen
All right, Butters, tell you what: if you can raise the two hundred and fifty million dollars yourself, you can stay.
Butters
Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
Stephen
It's called "working" young man! Your grandfather was a coal miner for fifty years; he never complained! Get out there and start digging!
Butters
Y-yes sir! [rushes out of the room] I-I gotta... mine some coal... really fast!
Stephen
[to Linda] That should keep him busy for a while while we get this transaction finished. Now, Ms. Hilton, how should we start? [they both grin]
Bebe's house, night. The living room is all decked out in disco furnishings. A disco ball hangs from the ceiling and harmless laser beams shoot here and there. The girls are enjoying themselves while the boys have mixed expressions.
Millie
[stands next to the closet while a crowd of girls looks on] Okay, that's two minutes. You can come out, Clyde, Bab. [the door opens and Bab comes out grinning] How was he, Bab?
Bab
[winks at Clyde] We had a great time, didn't we Clyde?
Clyde
[walks out crying with his hands rubbing his butt] Aaaaah, owieeee, owieeee. [a knock is heard at the front door and Red goes to answer it.]
Cartman
[dressed very casually, with hair slightly unkempt] Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
Red
[not fooled] Yeah? Who invited you?
Cartman
Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
Red
Kelly who?
Cartman
Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
Red
[looks over her shoulder and calls out] Kelly Rutherfordmenskin?
Kelly Rutherfordmenskin
[approaches the door] Yeah?
Red
Did you invite him?
Kelly Menskin
No! [goes back inside. Red closes the door on Cartman]
Cartman
Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
Red
[turns around and calls out] Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter?
Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter
[sharing a wading pool with Token and Heidi] What? [Red glares at Cartman]
Cartman
[under his breath] Oh, Goddammit!
Herbert Garrison's house, night. The doorbell rings and he goes to answer it. It's raining outside and thunderclaps roll soft and deep.
Herbert Garrison
Oh, hello Wendy. Are you all right?
Wendy
No, I need help.
Herbert Garrison
F-from from me?
Wendy
Actually, I was hoping to see your boyfriend.
Herbert Garrison
Well sure, come on in. Mr. Slave is right over here. [the camera follows them over to Mr. Slave, who's dangling from the ceiling like a marionette. He's moaning in pleasure]
Mr. Slave
Oooooooooooh! Oh Jesus, Jesus Christ!
Herbert Garrison
Mr. Slave, little Wendy from class wants to see you.
Mr. Slave
Oh, Hi Wendy. You need a little help with your math homework?
Wendy
No, I need help becoming a dirty whore like you
Herbert Garrison
...Oh dear. Mr. Slave, I think you and Wendy better have a little talk. I'll make some cocoa.
The sofa, moments later. Wendy and Mr. Slave sit side by side.
Wendy
Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.
Mr. Slave
Thank you sweetie.
Wendy
Can you teach me your secret fast?
Mr. Slave
Honey, I didn't work to become a whore, I was born a whore. I've been one... ever since I can remember. [a shot of the toddler Slave crawling around on a bed] Ever since I was a little boy I seemed to enjoy... different things.
Little Slave
Mommy, I think I have a fever. Can you take my temperature? [his mom approaches and sticks a thermometer up his butt] Oooo, Jesus Christ. [grins]
Mr. Slave
As I got older, I felt that one boy was never enough.
Boy Slave
[sees a football practice and fakes a call] Hey, there's that queer kid. Let's tackle him! [holds out his arms and waits for the tackle]
Kid
Hey yeah, tackle the queer kid! [the players gang up on him. He seems to love the punishment] We'll show you, queer!
Boy Slave
Oooooooooooh! Oooooooooooh! Jesus Christ!
Mr. Slave
So you see, I can't make you into a whore, Wendy. But why would you want to be one anyway?
Wendy
Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
Mr. Slave
A what?! For God's sake, where?!
Butters' house, outside. Butters is at the side of the house shoveling dirt from a mound.
Butters
You work eighteen hours and what do you get? Parents sell ya to Paris Hilton.

[a blue car pulls up alongside and stops]
Man
Look at that. A bear, mining for coal.
Woman
Huh, I never. [the car moves on. Butters' parents, Paris, and her driver approach him]
Stephen
Well, Butters, how'd it go? Did you dig up two hundred million dollars' worth of coal?
Butters
Well, no, not quite.
Stephen
Oh, well, too bad. [shows off the check] Ms. Hilton did raise the money, so you'll be going off with her.
Butters
[throws away his shovel] Ah, shucks! [moments later he follows Paris into the limo]
Linda
Bye, sweetie, we love you!
Inside the limo, Paris gets her camera and aims
Paris
Smile Mr. Biggles! This time I have to get a picture of my new pet before anything happens. [snaps a picture]
Butters
Before what happens? [gets no answer, so looks around and sees her "MY PETS" photo album. He picks it up and leafs through it]
The shots are gruesome. First up is Tinkerbell, with the gun and blood splattered all over the place; then Patches, a French poodle that hung itself, shown dangling from the noose; then Scrambles, a cat that somehow managed to slit its front paws, lying in a bathtub full of water and blood; then Cuddles, a dog that committed harakiri.
Butters:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! [throws the book away, gets out of the limo as fast as he can and runs away.]
Paris
[exits the limo] Mr. Biggles! Mr. Biggles, come back! [Butters' parents approach] You'd better help me find him! No Mr. Biggles, no money! [takes away the check]
Chris
Oh that trouble making son of ours! Butters! Butters, you get back here or you are grounded, mister!
Bebe's house, night. The party is still going strong. One Kelly, who had earlier been with Token, is chasing Kyle. Another Kelly chases Kevin. Red is coming on to Stan. Annie chases Kenny down and catches him. In general, the guys are being chased down by the girls. A girl with dark hair chases Craig, and is about to catch him. Annie talks to Kenny. Millie chases Tweek. Bebe chases Blue Cap. Mr. Slave kicks the front door open and enters with Wendy. Cartman appears behind then and enters.
Mr. Slave
Oh Jesus! [turns on the light] Kids, kids!
Annie
Ew, party foul!
Red
Shut off the light.
Stan
Oh, thank God.
Mr. Slave
Girls, what on earth are you doing?
Bebe
We're being stupid spoiled whores. [grins]
Butters
[rushes in] H-help! You've gotta hide me! [opens the closet door and enters] Don't tell her I'm in here! [closes the door]
Bebe
What did you do, Wendy?! Go rat on us because you're not invited to our Paris Hilton party?!
Mr. Slave
Okay, I think this has all gone far enough! Now look, the last person you want to be like is Paris Hilton!
Paris
[approaches the house and enters] Mr. Biggles!
Mr. Slave
[unaware] Paris Hilton is a nobody! She may have money, but she's a thoughtless, talentless lowlife!
Paris
Who the fuck are you calling a lowlife?!
Bebe
Wow, Paris Hilton is at my party! I rule!
Butters
[bolts out of the closet] HAAAAH! [Bab looks out from the closet, grinning]
Mr. Slave
Hon, will you just tell these girls that being a whore isn't such a great thing.
Paris
What isn't great about it? What's more to life than partying?
Mr. Slave
Look girls, I've partied a lot. Okay? And I'm telling you, there's more to life.
Paris
You don't even know what partying is, loser. [brushes him off]
Mr. Slave
Sweetie, really, don't go there, okay?
Paris
Oh I went there. I went there, took some pictures, and flew back already.
Girls
Ooooo!
Annie
Wow, what a bitch. [smiles]
Mr. Slave
Sweetie, listen, I know you've done some "partying" in your private little rich life, but you don't even wanna know the kind of stuff I've done. I'm the real whore, and I'm telling you, it isn't great.
Paris
Oh yeah?! I challenge you to a whore-off!
Girls
Ooooo!
Men
[popping up out of nowhere] Whore-off! Whore-off!
South Park's Whore-off. A gazebo is set up for the event in South Park Square. A crowd gathers.
Official
Ah, testing? Hello? [taps the mic a few times] Okay uh, welcome everyone. Uh, the South Park Chamber of Commerce is pleased to bring you the first annual "Who Is The Biggest Whore" showdown. [the crowd cheers]
Bebe
Mr. Slave has no idea what he's in for.
Red
Paris is gonna rock his world.
Official
Ah, I'm... not quite sure how we... start this competition off, but uh-
Paris
[gets off her chair and walks over to the mic] I'll show ya how we start it off. [the music starts and she kisses him hard and grabbing his crotch]
Crowd
Ohhh! [the girls are grinning, Wendy looks at the girls' reactions. Paris then has five men on stage with her, and one of them is licking her leg. Mr. Slave simply observes]
Wendy
[approaches Stan and friends, and Mr. Garrison] What is Mr. Slave doing? He-he's just sitting there.
Herbert Garrison
Give him time, Wendy. Give him time. [cheers him on softly] Come on, Mr. Slave.
Paris
[throws the men off] Back off! None of you losers are enough for me! [whips out a pineapple from behind her back and stuffs it up her vagina] Eeeaaagh. Oh yeah. Aaaargh. [some gasps] Tada! [the crowd cheers and fireworks go off]
Randy
Oh, no she di'int. [the crowd continues cheering]
Mr. Slave makes his move: he gets off his chair and walks over to Paris, then moves her around till he's satisfied she's where he wants her to be. The crowd falls silent and Mr. Slave walks back to his chair.
Mr. Slave
[dusts himself off and coughs] Jesus. [takes off his pants and takes a running leap towards Paris. He lands on her head and proceeds to swallow her up through his ass, with each swallow accompanied by a grunt. The first swallow takes her head; the second, her chest; the third, her abdomen and lower back; and the fourth takes the rest of her body.] Ohoho, Jesus. [the girls are stunned at what they just saw. The adults, the boys, and Wendy all cheer]
Herbert Garrison
Now, that's a whore! [Stan and friends are still stunned. Mr. Slave goes back to his chair and puts on his pants]
Bebe
Wow, I guess Paris isn't such hot shit after all.
Mr. Slave
People, don't applaud me. I'm a dirty whore. [the crowd falls silent] Being spoiled and stupid and whorish is supposed to be a bad thing, remember? Parents, if you don't teach your children that people like Paris Hilton are supposed to be despised, where are they gonna learn it?! You have to be the- [feels something in his stomach] ooohooho, Jesus Christ. You have to be the ones to make sure your daughters aren't looking up to the wrong people.
Mr. Stevens
The homosexual is right. From now on, Bebe, you're going to dress like a little girl. [the crowd disperses and the girls walk up to Wendy]
Bebe
Wendy, we're sorry we called you names. Like not-stupid and not-spoiled.
Red
Yeah, and I didn't mean to say you weren't a whore.
Wendy
That's okay, you guys. [Butters and his family are shown next]
Stephen
So-so that's it? No two hundred million dollars? Well, Butters, I hope you're happy!
Butters
[turns right and walks away] I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
Stephen
You're a grounded old bear.
Deep within Mr. Slave's intestine, Paris is trying to claw her way out.
Paris
Oh my God, it's so gross! Let me out of here! [a light comes on in front of her - it's the Frog King] What the fuck is that?
Frog King
Paris, you must find the way out of this place or you'll surely die.
Paris
What?
Frog King
Make your way to the small intestine. There you will meet the Sparrow Prince, who can guide you to Catatafish. Now go, Paris Hilton. Make haste! [disappears]
Singers
[End of Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset. Some singers sing the following song as Paris begins her journey:]
A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward Paris Hilton or you will soon be dead.
The road ahead is filled with danger and fright
But push onward, Paris Hilton, with all of your might.
Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton
Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton
Paris Hilton... Paris Hilton, Paris Hilton
Stupid whore!

End of Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset

Cartman's Incredible Gift
Cartman's yard, side of the house, day. The fourth grade boys are gathered there for some reason.
Clyde
I don't know, that looks pretty high up.
Butters
Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
Stan
Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. [Cartman is shown at the edge of the roof wearing wings made from cardboard]
Cartman
This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
Stan
It's not gonna work; just come down from there.
Cartman
[assessing the situation] ...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
Kyle
[arrives in time to see Cartman's attempt] What's going on?
Stan
Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. [Kyle looks up to see what the others see. Cartman looks down]
Kyle
Do it! Do it!
Cartman
I'm gonna!
Craig
I wouldn't if I were you.
Token
Those wings don't look very strong.
Kyle
Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
Cartman
Okay, here we go. [steps forward and gets ready to launch himself] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
Kyle
Awww, go on and do it already!
Cartman
Hold on, I'm givin' my speech! On this historic day, we remember the Wright Brothers: Orville and Redenbacher, whose dreams and visions inspired generations.
Stan
[to Kenny] He's not gonna do it.
Cartman
And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! [he flaps his cardboard wings a few times to get some lift, then jumps off the roof. He heads straight for the ground and lands on his face with a grunt. All the boys are shocked and stand there frozen for several seconds. Stan is the first to leave, then Kyle, then the rest of them. Only Butters remains, and he turns to watch the others leave. After a few seconds of uncertainty, he leaves too.]
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. Cartman is in a recovery room with bruises on his face and a black left eye. The medical staff attends him. Outside, Ms. Cartman appears and rushes in to see Cartman.
Liane
Oh my God! Eric! Eric, [caresses him] Mommy's here. Sweetie? [notices Dr. Doctor] Oh, what's wrong with him?
Dr. Doctor
I'm afraid that your son is... incredibly stupid. He thought he could fly with cardboard wings. The stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall, which has... put him into a deep coma.
Liane
Coma... My God, fo- for how long?
Dr. Doctor
There's no telling. He may never recover. We'll just have to wait. And see. [the camera looks at Cartman, then pans up and fades out]
Hell's Pass, some time later. The camera pans down back onto Cartman, who is now covered in facial hair and a bandage around his head.
Singers
Seasons change, time passes by.
As the weeks become the months become the years.

Cartman
Eugh... [sits up, his eyes still closed.]
Liane
[stands up and drops her book] Oh my- Doctor! [Cartman blinks] He's awake! [the doctor and nurse return]
Cartman
Wheh? Where am I?
Liane
Oh, you've finally come back! It's a miracle!
Dr. Doctor
You're at the hospital, Eric. You've been in a coma for some time.
Cartman
Coma... How long?
Dr. Doctor
It's been two... days. Nurse, you can remove his face-warmer now.
Nurse
Yes, Doctor. [tugs at the facial hair and it comes off.]
Dr. Doctor
Now, Eric, you've suffered massive head trauma. Your road to recovery will be long and arduous. At least another two days. [a shot of the hospital's exterior, then back to the recovery room, where Liane is giving Cartman a glass of chocolate milk]
Singers
Seasons change, time passes by. 
As the weeks become the months become the years.

Liane
You're doing so much better, muffin.
Cartman
Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
Liane
Oh, you're sounding just like your old self again.
Dr. Doctor
[at another patient's bed] I'm sorry, detectives, there was nothing we could do.
Yates
Damnit! Another murder victim! For three years the Left-Hand killer has been at large and I've exhausted every lead! Maybe... I just don't have what it takes to be a cop anymore.
Murphy
We'd better get back to the station, sir.
Cartman
Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
Yates
All right, let's go, Murphy. Hang on a second, where are, where are my car keys?
Cartman
Probably in your front pocket, dumbass!
Yates
[fishes around in the front shirt pocket and is surprised to find them there, then turns to the doctor] Doctor, didn't you say that kid suffered head trauma?
Dr. Doctor
Yes, it was pretty severe.
Murphy
What is it, Lou?
Yates
I've... heard cases where people suffering head trauma awaken to some psychic abilities.
Murphy
Aw, come on, sir.
Yates
I know it's ridiculous, [turns right and walks off] but I'm gonna explore every possibility I can! [Murphy follows. They arrive at Cartman's bed] Hello, young man, could we have a quick word with you?
Cartman
Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
Nurse 2
Twelve-thirty, Eric. Lunch time. [the officers are amazed at how timely the nurse came with the lunch]
Yates
Young man, how did you know the nurse was gonna walk in just now?
Cartman
I don't know, I just knew it. [receives the tray from the nurse and sniffs] Aww man, this smells like meatloaf. Again?!
Nurse 2
Yep, meatloaf again. [the officers get a little frightened]
Murphy
Jesus, how did he...?
Yates
Little boy... [whispers to himself] Well it's a snowball's chance in hell but... [back to Cartman] we were wondering if you could come down and see if your... new powers could help us catch the killer.
Liane
His new... powers?
Stark's Pond, newly restored from the demolished Wall Mart, much bigger than it was before, night. A crime scene at the docks is shown, complete with boat floating around.
Female Detective
All right, make sure you get pictures of everything in this crime scene. [one officer takes pictures, another handles evidence gingerly. Nearby, a police tape is lifted so Cartman could check out the scene]
Officer 1
Who's the kid?
Officer 2
He's supposed to be some kind of psychic.
Officer 1
Aw, Christ!
Yates
[with Murphy, Liane, and Cartman] This is... where the body was found. [overhead shot] Multiple stab wounds, just like all the others.
Cartman
How come the outline is missing its hand?
Murphy
The killer always cuts off the left hand of his victim, and keeps it as a trophy. [Cartman walks around the outline, inspecting it.]
Yates
Stand back, give him room! [moves to hold the crowd back] Come on, kid, concentrate! What do you see in your mind?
Cartman begins to concentrate and his eyes begin to twitch. First he sees a cupcake with chocolate topping and sprinkles, then powdered doughnuts, then a cup of vanilla ice cream - with sprinkles being added.
Cartman
Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles... [he sees a hand holding Double-Stuff Oreo] Double-Stuff Oreos... [a second hand comes up and twists off the lower cookie] He ... He's taking the top of one and... [squeezes his eyes closed and sees another Oreo attached to the first one so there are two fillings between the cookies] ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs! [the detective writes down what Cartman is seeing] I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
Yates
Jesus Christ!
Murphy
Sir?
Yates
Tom Johansen, the owner of the ice cream shop!
Tom Johansen's house, night. The detectives ring his doorbell and he answers.
Tom Johansen
Yes? Oh, hello, detectives.
Yates
Mr. Johansen, could we have a quick word with you?
Tom Johansen
Sure, come on in! [he backs up and leads them in. The lead detectives calls in some officers hidden nearby, and they come in] I'm afraid the house is a little bit of a disaster area since I have-
Yates
Get him! [the officers tackle Tom Johansen and beat him harshly with their batons] Code 6! Code 6!
Officer 3
Use the taser! Use the taser! [another officer fires a taser into Tom Johansen, who then convulses and falls to the floor]
Officer 4
Do it again! [the officer shocks Tom Johansen again, causing more convulsions]
Tom Johansen's house outside, front. Police cars and vans have gathered outside and the siren lights are still rotating.
Officer 3
He put up a hell of a fight, but we got him!
Tom Johansen
Why?! Why?! [the officers haul him away]
Yates
Congratulations, Eric. You just stopped the biggest killer in South Park history.
Murphy
We would give you a reward, but I guess that knowing the people of South Park are safe again is reward enough.
Cartman
Guess again.
Murphy
[walks over and hands him some money] All right, here's a hundred dollars.
Cartman
Wow!
Yates
[to Liane] His powers are uncanny. Take good care of him, Ms. Cartman. Make sure he uses his powers... for good.
Liane
Oh, he will. My little poopsiekins is a very good little boy.
South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings. Cartman runs down the hall.
Cartman
I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.

Kyle
[walks up. Other kids gather behind him] Cartman, what did you do?!
Cartman
Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! [shows off the money]
Kyle
Nice old Mr. Johansen runs a candy shop! He wasn't a killer and you know it!
Cartman
Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
Kyle
Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!
Cartman
Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
Kyle
You don't have any powers!
Cartman
Don't make me do it, Kyle! I can make your head explode with a single thought!
Butters
Wuh be careful, Kyle.
Kyle
He can't do crap!
Cartman
Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! [closes his eyes and starts making sound effects and hand motions. The boys behind Kyle except Stan and Kenny scatter, and the detectives spot him as they enter the school.]
Yates
There he is! Hey, Eric! Eric! [they approach him, he turns around] We've got a little problem.
Cartman
What?
Yates
While the ice-cream store owner was in jail, another murder was committed.
Murphy
This body also had a missing hand and a bowl of corn flakes next to it!
Yates
Which can only mean one thing!
Kyle
Ha! You see?!
Yates
That a copycat killer is on the loose! We need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away!
Kyle
What?!
Murphy
We'll pay you up front this time! We've gotta catch this new guy before he kills again.
Cartman
I'm afraid that my powers... are not for sale. ...And by that I mean they absolutely are for sale. Let's go!
Field report.
Chris Swollenballs
Tom, I'm standing in a meadow just outside of town, where police have discovered the first victim of the serial copycat killer. Child wunderkind Eric Cartman is now arriving on the scene. [Cartman approaches the body, which is covered with a red blanket]
The crime scene.
Kyle
This is fuckin' ridiculous!
Lou
Whattaya got, wunderkind? Are ya seeing anything?
Cartman
No. Nothing.
Officer 5
Maybe his powers have left him.
Officer 6
Yeah.
Cartman
Wait a minute. [his right arm twitches and he sees a bucket of chicken, then sees some chicken served next to the powdered doughnuts he saw earlier. His eyes are squeezed tight.] Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh! [sees some syrup poured onto the chicken] There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
Kyle
What the hell is wrong with these people?!
Michael Deets
[in robe and cap] They're never gonna catch the serial killer. He's too smart. Do you want to see my cotton panties? [whips open his robe to reveal himself dressed in a yellow bikini. The boys look on, a little afraid]
Kyle
Hey! What about this guy?!
Murphy
Quiet! He's havin' a vision!
Cartman
It is fried chicken! [first he sees a plate of fried chicken, then the maple syrup, then some whipped cream, then some chocolate syrup, then a cherry on top...] Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
Weird Man
[brings out a mannequin torso and head and strikes up a conversation with it] "Junior, what are you doing out?" I'm sorry, Mother. "You come home right now and have sex with me!" No, Mommy! [goes away]
Kyle
Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
Lou
I said quiet, you little brat, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with the law!
The News 4 logo and screen come up on a TV.
Announcer
This is Park County News 4, with your host, Jim Brown-ish
Jim Brown-ish
The copycat killer of the cut-off-the-left-hand killer has been arrested. Police used the help of Eric Cartman, a wunderkind psychic detective. At the crime scene, the young psychic had visions flash before his mind, and the police immediately arrested the owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The young man's visions were so astounding that other police departments have sought out his help.
Cartman's house, day. He's in his room counting the money he's made from his psychic work.
Cartman
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
If I'm happy and I know it, clap my hands.
[someone knocks on his door, then the door opens]

Liane
Eric, sweetie, there's um, some people here to see you.
Cartman
More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
Liane
Ah, no, these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives. [Cartman stops counting money and freezes]
Living room, moments later. Liane and Cartman enter.
Female Psychic
So, you are the little boy who's been taking all our work?!
Liane
Oooh, I'll go make some tea.
Male Psychic 1
Kid, we have a problem. You didn't go through the proper channels to become a psychic detective like we all did.
Other psychics
Yeah!
Cartman
Proper channels?
Male Psychic 2
You were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the Psychic Detective School. [shows the ad in question. Looks nice]
Cartman
I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
Male Psychic 1
Well you just can't say you're a psychic detective, you have to use the ad in the comic book!
Female Psychic
You must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings!
Cartman
[laughs at them] Ten percent, my balls, get lost!
Female Psychic
Very well, then you give us no choice. Roger?
Roger steps out from behind the sofa and prepares to battle Cartman psychically. Cartman simply observes, then responds. He and Roger "battle" with sound effects and hand gestures.
Female Psychic
All right, everyone! [the rest of the psychics join in the battle against Cartman. Liane returns with the tea.]
Liane
Oh, goodness! What's going on?
Cartman
Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
Liane
O-o-o-o-oh! [prostrates herself]
Female Psychic
Enough! [one male psychic is slow to respond] We are ...obviously quite evenly matched. I guess this will have to be settled in court.
Cartman
In court?
Female Psychic
We brought a class-action lawsuit against you! We'll see you before the judge tomorrow! [the psychics turn and walk out]
Liane
Is it over? [the front door closes after the last psychic leaves]
A camera shutter is heard and a picture of Ms. Crabtree appears, with blood next to her left cheek. Her left hand is missing. A detective continues taking pictures.
Murphy
[reading from a fact sheet] Her name is... Veronica Crabtree, bus driver for the elementary school. She was considered an ancillary character, one the fans wouldn't miss much.
Yates
Jesus Christ! Cause of death?
Murphy
Same M.O., sir. Multiple stab wounds, left hand cut off and missing.
Yates
So you're telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer?! Jesus! Where will it end?! [goes to a nearby tree to think] Every time I put a killer behind bars, another guy just steps in and takes his place! What am I doing wrong?!
Kyle
[arriving with Stan and Kenny] Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis. [holds out his findings] I'm pretty sure he's your man.
Lou
[coolly] How do you know?! Are you psychic?!
Kyle
No.
Lou
Look, kid, don't waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus! I have to find this new killer now! I owe it to that victim over there! I know she hadn't been in any recent episodes, but dammit she deserved better than this! Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again! [leaves with Murphy]
Kyle
Why won't anybody listen to me?!
Kenny
[pats Kyle on the shoulder] (Don't take it personally, Kyle.)
Kyle
[shrugs Kenny off] I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.
Kyle's house, later. Kyle is standing at the edge of the roof at the side of his house, sporting his own cardboard wings.
Stan
Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!
Token
There has to be another way!
Kyle
Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
Butters
Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an- and you'll crash into the ocean.
Stan
[under his breath] Butters, Goddammit.
Kyle
All right, here we go. [spreads his wings] Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! [jumps off and lands on the ground below]
Stan
[a few moments later, sighs] Call an ambulance.
Channel 4 News. A picture of handcuffs is shown, with "ARRESTS MADE" above it.
Jim Brown-ish
Multiple arrests were made today for the murder of Hillary Neals. Police raided the South Park Motel 6 at 4 a.m., where seven psychic detectives were staying. [footage of the arrests is shown. Two of them are beaten, a third is slammed against a squad car until the side of her head begins to bleed, and a fourth holds police at bay. He tries to fight them with his powers, but they simply open fire and kill him where he stands] The psychic detectives' horrible crime was found out by psychic detective Eric Cartman, [shown in dramatic pose with psychic waves emanating from his forehead] who is now the only psychic not behind bars. What an amazing coincidence.
Cartman watches the news from the sofa in the living room at his house.
Cartman
Cool. [the doorbell rings and Cartman concentrates] Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle! [the door opens and the weird man from the crime scenes enters and approaches Cartman] Who are you?
Michael Deets
You. You give everyone else credit for my work, because you fail to see my greatness.
Cartman
... 'Kay. Sweet.
Michael Deets
Because of you, nobody knows the extent of my deeds.
Cartman
Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second. [hops off the sofa, walks away a bit, and calls out] Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. [the weird man quickly advances and smothers Cartman's face with a cloth, making Cartman inhale chloroform. Cartman passes out.]
Next scene is an unknown place. Cartman is strapped down to a wheelchair. He awakens and struggles a bit.
Cartman
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
Michael Deets
You are obviously a big fan of my work.
Cartman
I don't even know you dude!
Michael Deets
But I am the serial killer! The one whose rightful place in history you have smirched!
Cartman
Oh, Jesus.
Michael Deets
And now you will have a place of honor, as my nineteenth victim.
Cartman
No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
Michael Deets
Before you die, let me show you the things that I've done, so you will understand the breadth of my transformation! [starts up a slideshow projector] This... is me at the grand canyon. [shows a shot of him there] Do you see? This is me at Mount Rushmore [the next picture is shown, with him looking lovingly at the faces there] Do you see?
Cartman
[nervously] Heheh.
Michael Deets
Do you see?!
Cartman
Yes yes, I see! [another Mount Rushmore picture is shown, with the man looking at the camera this time]
Michael Deets
Here I am at the Alamo in San Antonio. [this time he looks psychotic, with his hands ready to grab something] This was just outside of the gift shop. Do you see?!
Cartman
AAAAAAAH!
Park County Police Station, night.
Yates
[hangs up the phone] Dammit! Dammit all to hell! They just found another body! That means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose! Where's my psychic?!
Female Detective
Sorry, Sarge, the psychic's mom says her son hasn't been home for a couple of hours.
Officer 7
Sir! Dr. Kels just called from the hospital! He says another little boy just awoke from a coma, and is having psychic visions!
Yates
[grabs his hat] Let's go! [other officers follow]
Hell's Pass Hospital, later. Dr. Doctor leads them into the recovery room.
Dr. Doctor
This is the young man here. He was in a coma for over sixteen hours. [a shot of Kyle with a bandage around his head. He too has a face warmer on, but no black eye like Cartman had]
Yates
Doctor, could you remove his face warmer? We'd like to speak with him.
Dr. Doctor
Of course. Nurse? [a brunette approaches and removes the warmer. Sgt. Lou and Det. Murphy approach the bed]
Yates
Young man, the doctor said you've had some... visions about our newest murder?
Kyle
I see... a man... with a baseball cap. [Sgt. Lou snaps his fingers and Det. Murphy whips out a notepad and pen and starts taking notes. Kyle concentrates] He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.
Yates
What do you think, Mitch?
Murphy
I don't know. How do we know this kid is really psychic? I mean, this boy is certainly no Eric Cartman. [Kyle clenches his teeth in rage]
Yates
All right, we'll check this Deets guy out. But let's use that one thing that we never use.
Murphy
...Sir?
Yates
You know, what's that one thing that starts with an R that we never use?
Murphy
...Restraint?
Yates
Yeah, yeah, restraint. We'll check this guy out, but let's use some restraint. [they leave]
Michael Deets' basement. He's still showing Cartman his slides.
Michael Deets
Look! Look at the things I've done! Here I am at Yellowstone National Park! [shows off the picture] Do you see?! Here are pictures of my trip to Cheyenne for Frontier Days. Do you see?!
Cartman
Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! [the doorbell is heard. The two detectives are outside, Yates ringing the doorbell. Michael Deets opens the door]
Yates
Good evening, sir. We're Park County detectives. We were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house, Misterrr...
Michael Deets
God.
Yates
Well, Mr. God, it won't take but a second; it might help us with an investigation. [he shows them in. The house is dark, with stacks of paper everywhere. Pictures of his victims line the walls. Downstairs, Cartman tries to get attention.]
Cartman
(Hey! Come over here!)
Yates
I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women. My son is a big fan of that, too.
Murphy
Sarge! In here! [Lou runs into the next room. They both face a wall of left hands nailed in place]
Yates
Jesus H.... That boy was right! Arrest that guy! [Murphy gets right on it. Yates thinks about the hands] Whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo! Oh, wait a minute, no ah, I'm wrong.
Murphy
Sir?
Yates
This isn't the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims' left hands.
Murphy
Right.
Yates
Well those aren't left hands. [holds up his own left hand, palm in] See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands.
Murphy
Ohhh. [they return to the living room]
Yates
Nope, this isn't our man. [they turn to leave the house and see Michael Deets in the shadows] We're sorry, Mr. God. It appears we've wasted your time. [they head out]
Cartman
[in the basement] (Hey! Help!) [upstairs, Mr. Deets closes the front door]
Murphy
Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer.
Yates
[stops and thinks] Yeah... Amazing coincidence...
Murphy
[backs up] Heh- sir?
Yates
Call it police intuition, but somethin' in there just didn't feel right. [thinks for several seconds] Wait a minute.
Murphy
Sarge... [Lou slowly raises his hand palm in and analyzes it. Then he turns his hand over slowly until the palm is out and is jolted with recognition] What is it?
Yates
I'm not sure. I'm gonna have to run some tests. [runs off to do just that]
Park County Police Station, night. Montage. Yates types away at his computer, then analyzes his left hand again, then returns to the keyboard. He then goes to the lab and looks over his notes. Next to him are two hands, one right and one left. He rotates the right hand so both thumbs point to the left, from his POV, then takes more notes. He develops some pictures in the darkroom and finds matching hands. He works with a 3D model drawing with another computer, then traces his left hand on a wall and takes measurements. He returns to the lab and works with some chemicals. Next he chops some firewood into smaller chunks. Next he's at a gym jumping rope. Next he's at a beach far from South Park playing volleyball with some women. Next he's repairing the body of a car with a welding torch...
Yates
[back at the station, looks in on Murphy] Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?
Murphy
Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer?
Yates
[snaps his fingers] Oh right! The hands! Right! [the montage resumes]
Again he goes to his computer and types away then he's back at the lab taking pictures of the two fake hands there, then makes silhouettes of a dog, then models another hand in the computer and gets a match.
Yates
Oh my God. Murphy! [Murphy appears quickly.] You're not gonna believe this.
Michael Deets house, basement. Michael Deets has resumed showing his pictures to Cartman. A picture of him at Ocean World's Splash Zone is shown, then a blank. He turns the projector off.
Michael Deets
That's it, no more pictures. [walks in front of Cartman and faces him, then pulls out a sharp knife] Time to die.
Cartman
No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
Michael Deets
Your hand will be one with the others.
Cartman
Please just let me go! Ah, I'm gonna tell everyone I'm not really psychic! I've learned my lesson! Please, I don't wanna- [spots the detectives descend the stairs and approach the room] I don't wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! [begins to concentrate and make noises]
Yates
Hold it right there, killer! [Michael Deets turns and rushes at them with the knife. Yates fires three shots into him, killing him. The detectives advance, and Yates fires a forth shot into the body, looks around, and fires a fifth shot, getting blood splattered on himself]
Cartman
You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.
Hell's Pass Hospital, day. The detectives, the psychics, Mr. Johansen, Dr. Docter, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny are present.
Yates
Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.
Tom Johansen
Yes, thank you very much, Kyle.
Female Psychic
Yes, thanks.
Murphy
You're certainly a better psychic then Eric.
Kyle
No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
Murphy
Do you think that's true?
Yates
It must be true. The kid is psychic. [thinks a moment] But I don't suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy. [they leave the room and then the hospital]
Female Psychic
[addressing Cartman] Well young man, I guess that just leaves one score to settle.
Cartman
You can't hurt me.
Male Psychic
Then let this be our final battle! [the psychics face Cartman once again and battle him with their power. Nothing happens, but there's a lot of noise.]
Kyle
[irritated] Just stop it! [at the top of his lungs] Stoop iiit!! [the lights go out as the bulbs shatter, then the shelf above his bed falls and everything on it hits the floor. The psychics and Cartman stop their battle and witness all this] There's a logical explanation for that.
End of Cartman's Incredible Gift

Woodland Critter Christmas
A panoramic view of South Park, day. Holiday music is heard in the background, and the scenes are played out as the narrator mentions them.
Narrator
Way up in the mountains in a small little town,
The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.
People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,
Because Christmas needs to be bought in a store.
But out in the forest, not too far away...

A nearby forest. The camera pans down from the sky and rest upon a Christmas tree. Forest animals gather round and decorate it.
Narrator
...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.
Woodland Critters
It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.
A Woodland Critter Christmas!

Narrator
The little critters worked hard as they happily sang,
And each one of them had a quite interesting name.
There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear.
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer.
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat.

Stan
[walks by with a sled] What the hell?
Singer
Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all

The forest. The critters approach Stan.
Rabbity
Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest.
Skunky
How do you like our Christmas tree?
Stan
It's... nice.
Beavery
Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest! [the other cheer]
Mousey
Oh no, I see a problem.
Deery
What is it, Mousey?
Mousey
Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star.
Critters
Awww.
Beary
We can't have a tree with no star on it.
Rabbity
What are we gonna do?
Squirrely
Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star.
Critters
[among other things] Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us?
Stan
Okay, okay.
Critters
[cheering] Yay!
Narrator
And so, using some paper and working with glee,
the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree.

Critters
Ohhhh!
Beary
It's the nicest star I ever saw.
Narrator
The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...
Beavery
How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?
Narrator
The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...
Stan
[doesn't smile] Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. [turns around, picks up the reins on his sled and walks off]
Beavery
Goo- goodbye Stanny!
Critters
Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!
Stan
Woof.
Stan's bedroom, night. He's asleep in bed, but wakes up, turns over, and turns on his light.
Critters
Hi, Stanny!
Stan
Oh, whatta? [squeezes his eyelids shut]
Narrator
His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise!
The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes!

Stan
[irritated, grabs his clock] What time is it?!
Squirrely
You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!
Skunky
Porcupiney is pregnant!
Stan
[sighs] You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
Mousey
I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization.
Deery
Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate.
Foxy
She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.
Stan
...What?
Porcupiney
It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day.
Mousey
So soon!
Skunky
How delightful!
Woodpeckery
Our souls are saved!
Chickadee-y
Finally the critters are gonna have a Savior of their very own, of their very own! [they all cheer]
Squirrely
[hops onto Stan's bed] There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.
Critters
Awwww.
Beary
But we got to have a manger.
Rabbity
Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh?
Critters
(Cheers)
Narrator
"Of course I'll build you a little manger!" the little boy cried,
and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!

The forest. Stan has built the manger and is hammering the last few nails in place.
Narrator
And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead,
making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head,

Rabbity
Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw.
Mousey
I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord.
Raccoony
Does this mean we can go to sleep now?
Porcupiney
My son will have the nicest bed in all the forest.
Woodpeckery
Fit for a king!
Squirrely
This is going to be the best critter Christmas ever!
Woodland Critters
It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near --

Stan
[as they sing] All right, I'm going now. [He ambles off. A roar is heard nearby. All stop and look. The critters scream.]
Critters
The mountain lion! Hide! [They scatter, leaving Stan to face the lion alone. The lion peers out from behind a tree.]
Stan
Go away! Shoo! [The lion moves off and the critters return.]
Squirrely
Is it gone?
Mousey
I deduce it is.
Skunky
[behind a low tree] I'm not c-c-comin' out.
Foxy
Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again.
Stan
Again?
Squirrely
Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.
Porcupiney
Oh dear, I'm so very afraid.
Beavery
[climbs onto a stump and sits up] Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born.
Critters
Awwww! [some of them sob]
Squirrely
Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!
Raccoony
Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion!
Porcupiney
Christmas is saved! [the critters cheer]
The camera looks up from the woods to a mountain in the distance. Dramatic music plays.
Narrator
High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak,
the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.
For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty old cat...

Stan
Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!
Narrator
Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
Narrator
Killing a mountain lion was no easy task,
But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast.

Stan
[gesturing] Grrr! Grrr! Come on out! [The lion is heard roaring from inside the cave, and it roars. It approaches the entrance.] Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! [Anticipating the lion's leap, he runs off. The lion lunges at him, but misses. Stan moves to the side of the peak and turns, gesturing.] Rawrrrrr! [Stan runs up the side of the peak, and the lion follows. Stan reaches the peak and turns to face the lion. The lion lunges at Stan again. Stan drops out of the way and the lion goes over the peak and onto its death below, at the cave entrance.]
Narrator
In a flash, it was over! A victorious blow!
The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below.

The cave entrance. Stan sees that the mountain lion is motionless and approaches.
Stan
Okay, there. [three lion cubs approach the entrance]
Lion Cub 1
Mommy? Mommy! [they rush up to her body] W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!
Lion Cub 2
Don't leave us, Mommy. [Stan realizes that this dangerous mountain lion was a mom, so his jaw drops. The pale cub approaches him.] Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why?
Stan
[at a loss for words] I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? [The cubs snuggle close to their mom's body, sobbing.]
Narrator
The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried,
All alone in the world because their mother had died.

Stan
[turns away and squeezes his eyes shut] Aw- awww!
The forest floor, night. The critters have set up a campfire close to the manger and are keeping warm by it.
Porcupiney
[feeling a kick] Oooo.
Beary
You all right, Lady Porcupiney?
Porcupiney
Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all.
Beavery
Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead.
Foxy
Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole.
Rabbity
I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew.
Critters
Awwww.
Chickadee-y
[flitting straight up into the air] Wait a minute, look! [the animals turn to see Stan approaching them]
Critters
Stanny! [they gather in front of him]
Mousey
Stanny, you're alive.
Beary
But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?
Stan
It's dead.
Deery
For real and for true?
Beavery
Are you sure?
Stan
I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
Squirrely
He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
Critters
Hail Satan!
Stan
Wait, wha-what?
Beavery
You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!
Critters
Yaaay!! [they head over to the manger]
Stan
Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
Squirrely
Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness.
Stan
But I thought you meant the Son of God!
Deery
Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine?
Chickadee-y
No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay!
Foxy
This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!
Rabbity
Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!
The other critters cheer. Stan is frozen stunned as Beary pulls up a Satanic altar on a small wagon with a little help from Squirrely. The other animals bring Rabbity up to the altar. Rabbity is propped up on the altar and Beary tears him apart with a sacrificial blade. The other animals crowd in, tear away pieces of the body, and eat them raw.
Chickadee-y
Drink his blood! Drink his blood!
Squirrely
[jumps into a puddle of blood] Blood orgy!
Critters
Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!
The critters drench themselves in Rabbity's blood and begin the orgy. Beavery mounts Raccoony, Skunky mounts Porcupiney, Mousey mounts foxy, and Beary mounts Deery. Squirrely hops onto Deery's left ear and mounts that. Chickadee-y and Woodpeckery start flitting around. In the background is heard "Sting, so true!" Stan stares, traumatized.
Critters
What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.

Squirrely
[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
The forest floor, night. The critters return to the manger and decorate it with Satanic symbols, including (what is presumably) Rabbity's skull. As the narrator speaks, the following takes place. The star atop the manger is turned so it points down. Owls bring flowers to the mountain lion's corpse. The lion cubs are shown, then the mountain peak, then Stan is shown with his head buried into his arms at his desk in his room.
Narrator
In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn,
The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be born.
The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,
But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.
And meanwhile, three lion cubs were crying away.
For them, there would certainly be no Christmas Day.
And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.
All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat.

Stan
Ugh.
Narrator
Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen,
there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed.

Stan
Uuugh!
Narrator
"I know!" he said with a new happy grin,
"I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"

Stan
[waves the narrator away and leaves his desk] No, no-no-no.
Narrator
He ran out the living room, turned out the light,
and went back to the forest to set everything right!
[Stan enters the living room, hops on the sofa, and turns on the TV. "The Jeffersons" theme song is heard. He turns the volume up to drown out the narrator, but to no avail.]
But his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee... He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!
[Stan rolls his eyes]
He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!

Stan
Leave me alone!!
Narrator
He knew that only by going to the forest could he --
Stan
All right, all right, all right! God! [He turns off the TV, hops off the sofa and walks out the door, leaving the remote control on the floor.]
The manger at the forest clearing, day. The animals continue decorating.
Beavery
[looks around] Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny. [the other critters turn and look]
Woodpeckery
Oh boy, Stanny. You came just in time!
Deery
Yeah. We've got a big problem.
Squirrely
The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into.
Chickadee-y
That way he could take over the whole world! The whole world!
Mousey
The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ.
Beavery
We figured you'd be perfect!
Critters
Yay!
Stan
I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
Critters
Awwwww.
Beary
But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist.
Deery
Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critter C-Christmas after all.
Squirrely
Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human.
Chickadee-y
Will you really, Stanny?
Stan
No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist! [walks off] I came here to put a stop to all this!
Beavery
To stop us?
Beary
But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil Satanic powers on ya.
Stan
Right, whatever. [turns around] I'm taking down the manger I built. [Beary's eyes turn red and brighten. A wall of hellfire appears before Stan.] Ah! [The wall gets higher.] Aaaah! [All the critters' eyes are flashing a bright red. Black crows swoop down and attack Stan.] Aagh! Aaaahh! [A two-headed demon dog appears snarling at him; he runs off in terror.] AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! [The critters' eyes revert back to normal.]
Beary
Oh boy! Our Satanic powers sure did the trick!
Chickadee-y
Our powers get stronger every day! Get stronger every day!
Squirrely
Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion.
Skunky
And you got rid of her.
Critters
Yay!
Narrator
The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill.
Then he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!

Stan
Oh yeah.
The mountain peak, day. Stan climbs up to the cave again.
Stan
Hello? Anybody in there? [the three cubs appear at the entrance of the cave]
Lion Cub 3
Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!
Lion Cub 1
He's come to kill us now!
Lion Cub 2
It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways.
Lion Cub 3
Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around.
Stan
Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
Lion Cub 1
You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister?
Stan
I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!
Lion Cub 3
Yeah, and you killed her.
Stan
Well, you're mountain lions.
Lion Cub 2
Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth.
Lion Cub 1
And our baby claws.
Lion Cub 3
And a dead mom.
Stan
There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
Lion Cub 3
What? You mean like in an abortion?
Lion Cub 2
Yeah. An abortion. That can work.
Lion Cub 1
But, we don't know how to give abortions.
Lion Cub 3
Do you know some place we can learn, mister?
Narrator
"Where can they learn that?" the boy said with a frown.
"I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town."

Stan
[cross] What?!
Narrator
So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.
And took them to where abortions are performed.

Stan
No, he didn't.
Narrator
Yes, he did.
Stan
No, he didn't!
Narrator
Yes, he did.
Stan
No, he didn't!
Narrator
Yes... he... [Next scene has Stan holding the cubs at the abortion clinic as the doctor there prepares to abort a baby.] did!
Stan
Oh, Goddammit! [the doctor and patient are startled]
Narrator
Said the boy in the red poofball hat! "We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!"
Doctor
[walks over] Excuse me, what are you doing here?!
Narrator
The abortion doctor inquired.
Doctor
If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!
Stan
I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
Doctor
Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!
It's only three days until Christmas, so I have lots of abortions to perform!
Gather around my table, cute little lions,
I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!

Narrator
And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base,
And all day watched abortion after abortion take place.

Montage. The doctor puts on his gloves and the cubs peer into the patient's vagina. Stan peers in as well, from a distance. The doctor works away happily and cleans up well. The patient leaves, and the next one is worked on. Lion cub 2 is on a desk next to a bottled fetus. He hops off, knocking the bottle off as well. The bottle pops open and the fetus falls out. Everyone turns and sees the fetus on the floor, and laugh about it. The doctor works on the next patient and Lion cub 3 brings him some forceps. The doctor smiles and strokes the cub's head. The other two cubs snuggle up to the patient on her shoulders, and she smiles at them.

Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year.

Stan
This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
The forest floor. The critters walk along singing their Christmas tune.
Critters
It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.

Beary
Oh look. That little feller is all alone.
Skunky
Gee, he looks sad. [Kyle is seen kneeling next to his sled, looking sad.]
Critters
Hi there!
Kyle
[gets up and turns around] What the hell?
Beavery
How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.
Kyle
My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
Raccoony
Aww, but why?
Kyle
Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
Critters
[cheering] Yay!
Beary
But does that mean you aren't baptized?
Kyle
No. I'm Jewish.
Critters
[exulting] Yay! Yay! [they gather around Kyle]
Beavery
You've got to come with us!
Deery
You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!
Kyle
Huh?
Critters
[taking him away] Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!
Critters
What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas.

Squirrely
[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
The woods, night. The camera pans along to reveal a glowing red pentacle in the starry sky.
Narrator
'Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high,
a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.
For the world to be saved there was only one shot,
A little boy with three clubs and an abortion plot.

Stan
Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
Lion Cub 3
Sure. We know how to give abortions now.
Narrator
He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight,
but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight.

The critters are standing around the manger. A grotesque creature lies in the cradle.
Beavery
Gosh, we did it!
Squirrely
The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest. [The Antichrist growls and throws little fits.]
Narrator
The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate.
The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late.

Stan
Too late?! The hell is that?!
Beavery
Oh. Hiya, Stanny!
Kyle
[now tied to the altar, frightened] Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
Stan
It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!
Skunky
Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host.
Critters
Let's go! All right! Woohoo!
Stan
[turns to the lion cubs] That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! [Skunky, Squirrely, Beary, and Chickadee-y walk over to get Kyle. Santa's sleigh appears in the sky.]
Narrator
When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard,
And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!

Beavery
Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!
Critters
[cheering] Yay!
Raccoony
Let's eat his flesh! [the sleigh lands and rolls to a stop]
Santa
[hops out] All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!
Raccoony
We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny.
Skunky
Death and pain await all living things.
Santa
Little boy, you should be ashamed!
Stan
I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
Santa
Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! [He reaches back and whips out a long shotgun. He fires, and the top half of Beavery's head is gone.]
Critters
Aaaaah! [They scatter. Santa fires again, and Deery goes down. Two more shots and the tops of Raccoony's and Skunky's heads come off.]
Stan
Dude, what the- ? [Squirrely activates his demon power with the red glow from his eyes and a wall of hellfire appears before Santa.]
Singers
Hold steady, Santa.
Santa simply hops over it, gets into position, and fires at Squirrely, blowing him to smithereens.
Stan
[goes to untie Kyle from the altar] Come on, dude. [Santa continues firing at the remaining critters. Porcupiney is blown apart, then Foxy.]
Beary
Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you- [His head is blown off and he goes down.]
Dark Cub
But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist? [Stan and Kyle join Santa and the cubs.]
Santa
Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into.
Kyle
[looks down] No. [walks towards the manger] No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
Stan
What?! Kyle?!
Kyle
[now in the manger, behind the trough] With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
Santa
Don't do it, Kyle! [Grinning evilly, Kyle holds the little Antichrist in his left hand. A glow emanates from the Antichrist and its spirit floats out of its body and into Kyle's chest.]
Stan
Dude!
Kyle
[returns to the altar, climbs up, and exults] Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
Kyle
[voice-over] Oh, stop it, Cartman! [the spell is broken]
Mr. Garrison's class, day. All the students are seated, and it turns out they're taking turns telling Christmas stories. Cartman is telling his now.
Kyle
Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
Cartman
I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. [behind him on the board is written "Write Your Own Christmas Story Day"]
Kyle
This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
Cartman
Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
Mr. Garrison
Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.
Cartman
[closes his booklet] All right, fine! Forget it! [He drops off the stool and heads for his desk.]
Butters
Well but, but what happened?
Token
Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
Clyde
What happens to the lion cubs?
Cartman
Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
Stan
No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner.
Kyle
Dude, why do you care?!
Stan
Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
Kyle
Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
Cartman
That's not at all what happens.
Butters
Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end.
Clyde
Yeah yeah, come on! [the other kids chime in]
Kyle
All right, fine!
Cartman
[He returns to the stool and resumes the story. He clears his throat.] "Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?" said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
The spell is restored. Kyle is back on the altar exulting.
Kyle
HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the -- [feels something...] Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this! [hops off the altar] I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!
Stan
Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
Kyle
Oh God, what have I done?! [sits down] I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
Santa
[with his shotgun at the ready] I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! [pumps the shotgun]
Stan
No Santa, don't!
Santa
We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul.
Narrator
The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl,
But that's when he came up with the best idea of all.

Stan
The lion cubs!
Narrator
The little boy quickly begun,
Stan
I took them to see how abortions are done.
Santa
What?
Stan
Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!

Narrator
And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion.
They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion.

The lion cub 3 is deep in Kyle's ass, retrieving the Antichrist with his teeth. He succeeds and takes it to Santa quickly. Santa takes it and sets it down on a tree stump. Santa grabs a large sledgehammer next to the stump, raises it over his head, and bring it down upon the Antichrist, smashing it to bits with a loud THUD.
Kyle
Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
Santa
Well little boy, it seems that you [points to Stan] have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?
Stan
[smiles] Yeah. Yeah, there is.
The lions' cave. Santa arrives at the corpse of the mountain lioness and moves his hand over it, releasing some magic dust and watching it settle. The lioness stirs.
Mother Lion
Wha -- Oh my, what happened?
One of the Cubs
[the three of them run up to greet her] Mommy?
The Cubs
Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!
Stan
[relieved] Oh, good.
Stan's house. He runs into his parents' arms as Shelly and Grandpa look on. Next, they're all seated at table, eating. Next, Stan and Shelly are opening their gifts..
Narrator
And back home, there were presents, and lots of food to get fat.
And it was the best Christmas ever for the boy in the red poofball hat.

A shot of the town, receding from view.
Narrator
And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later. [Q shot of Kyle back in the hospital, dying.]
Kyle
[voice-over] Goddammit, Cartman!
End of Woodland Critter Christmas.

Christmastime is once a year,
Every creature holds it dear,
Every animal big or small,
